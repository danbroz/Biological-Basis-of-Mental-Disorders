      "title": "DISADAPTED BEHAVIOR OF ADOLESCENTS AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEM",
      "abstract": "The common interpretation of the concept of disadaptation behavior is that it is not about individual acts, the reaction of protest but about a more or less stable used stereotype of behavior or almost «lifestyle», is closely related to the constant personal characteristics of subjects of such behavior. Reactions of protest against authorities can be generalized and be directed against the family, schools, institutes of socialization. Their content is confrontation with authorities (father, teacher), the existing laws, the structure of social norms. Sometimes there is a failure to resist and avoid it, which facilitates entry to pseudo-religious communities or informal groups. Reactions of protest may be related to the experience of «alienation». The latter is understood as changes in the perception of oneself (depersonalization), other people or the surrounding reality (derealisation). Depersonalization is a manifestation in the behavior of extreme individualism, when the young man deliberately or because of the necessity of living conditions sharply opposes himself to society, refuses to live according to the rules that most of us adhere to. These are not hardcore criminals, drug addicts, «people of the bottom», whose behavior does not fit into what most define as normal acceptable standards.Negative deviations of behavior are related to the fact that a person does not absorb positive sides, cannot adapt to moral values and norms of behavior that meet the requirements of society, although he may know these norms well. In such a situation, the process of socialization of the individual is broken, which manifests itself in unbalanced mental processes, non-adaptation, violation of the process of self-actualization or in the form of avoiding moral and aesthetic control of its own behavior, which becomes socially disadapted. It would be a great mistake to consider disadaptation only as a negative side, as a devastating manifestation of individualism. Very often disadaptation is only an original, unusual behavior that is simply not perceived, criticized or shocked by the social majority. Disadapted behavior can be of a creative nature, when it helps the person to create his unique original image. Moreover, the owners of such originality can achieve remarkable success in the society.",

      "title": "Competencias especializadas de intervención en desadaptación social adolescente",
      "abstract": "Antisocial behaviors that persist during adolescence may imply a progressive social imbalance for the individual. Educational and psychosocial intervention in these adolescents requires a high specialization, since when the violation of the law is presented as a persistent pattern of behavior it would be associated with a disadvantaged family, school and social environment where the adolescent experiences difficulties in solving basic needs and seeks alternative ways of coping with life events, adapting to particular contexts, which can often be more reinforcing, ignoring the general social context. This persistent group presents a lot of heterogeneity both in psychological aspects and in criminal behavior, observing different criminal trajectories that require different types of intervention, which further complicates the work of the intervention teams. The trajectories observed in men and of increasing complexity would be: (a) determined by contextual risk factors; (b) adolescents with stories of violation of rights and abandonments; (c) adolescents with traumatic situations in their lives, disruptive behaviors and disorganized functioning; (d) adolescents socialized in criminogenic contexts with stories of rape in them, leading them to an antisocial functioning focused on their personal well-being; (d) adolescents socialized in criminogenic contexts, seeking to validate themselves socially, strengthening their personal identity through countercultural behaviors (Alarcon, et al., 2012). Through a case control design, we seek to identify the specialized skills to which a training program for intervention in adolescent social maladjustment must respond. Eight professionals who participated in a specialized training process (cases) and eight professionals without training (controls) were interviewed. From the content analysis, seven macro competences were validated before a group of experts: (a) Develop a comprehensive, informed and coherent framework on the process of social maladjustment of adolescents and their context of focus; (b) Design and develop an evaluation process of the adolescent of attention; (c) Intervene with the adolescent; (d) Evidence of ethical behavior in the intervention; (e) Develop the constant self-knowledge of the intervener; (f) Promote and develop a helping relationship with the adolescent, and (g) Exhibiting behaviors and skills that promote teamwork. The results confirm specialized competences that emphasize a differentiated vision of the adolescent and the work team as a source of validation in decision making. Similarly, those with training highlight skills related to knowledge, a prospective perspective and know-how; while those who have not received training highlight the attitudes associated with knowing how to be. The need to evaluate the specialization of professional teams that intervene with adolescents who violate the law is discussed, facilitating the development of knowledge, abilities and skills, without neglecting the development of reflective attitudes in the training processes of each professional and within the teams, to promote continuous improvement. As limitations of this study, it is considered that the participants were officials who participated in a training process (cases) and other officials from institutions with similar demographic characteristics but without systematic training (controls); This involved accessing professionals between the ages of 30 and 45, not being able to know the perspective of those under 30 or over 45, or service personnel who share daily with adolescents, being able to link up and influence their changes. As challenges for future research, it is necessary to have indicators to verify competence and observe it with respect to its adjustment with the distinctive characteristics of adolescents. Along with this, the need to observe in greater detail the possibilities of educational and psychosocial intervention in family, school and community contexts that are estimated to involve eventual crisis scenarios for adolescents at the time of reintegration is observed. The above to effectively promote interventions that allow adolescents to exercise their role as citizens. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2021.38.3.4",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DEPENDENCE ON ADULTS AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE BY PEERS",
      "abstract": "The belief is widely held by those responsible for guidance of children that extreme dependence upon adults in a nursery school situation indicates that the child has not had his needs met for satisfaction in contacts with adults, particularly his parents. It is also commonly assumed that a warm and satisfactorily dependent relationship with adults (particularly parents) must exist before a child can be secure enough to gain emotional satisfaction from social competence with and acceptance by peers. Sears' (7) position provides some support for these points of view. He has thought of extreme preschool-aged dependency as being possibly due to weaning and feeding frustration in infancy, these having aroused anxiety associated with adults so that adult controlling and manipulating behavior is essential to the child's emotional economy. Dependency is the expression of this controlling behavior. The opinion is seldom advanced that adult dependency in preschool situations may be due to lack of techniques for'relating with peers, without other dynamic determinants. Rarely expressed also is the opinion that exteremely gratifying parents may develop habits of dependency in their children (probably reinforced by the same kind of teachers), thus perhaps reducing or precluding the possibility that the children can find equivalent satisfaction with their peers. To the authors' knowledge, it has not been established empirically that any relationship, positive or negative, exists between dependence on adults and competence with peers, including acceptance by them. While Heathers (r) has studied relations between preschool children's dependence on teachers and their types of play with peers, he has not dealt with social acceptance as such, and its relationship with dependency. One investigation deals with this subject indirectly: McCollum (4) reported that a teacher's rating",

      "abstract": "Children who cannot be looked after by their parents or close relatives often end up being cared for by state-run organizations. In many parts of the world, orphaned young infants are put into institutions that lack good quality intimate social relationships and cognitive stimulation. The effects on physical, neurobiological, cognitive and social development are often profound, with environmentally determined patterns of development seldom otherwise seen, such as quasi-autism and indiscriminate social behavior. Placement of such children into good-quality foster or adoptive care can lead to considerable catch up, but often social difficulties remain. A different kind of residential care is seen for looked after children who are too difficult to foster; again the outcomes are not good, often for several reasons, as such group-care homes are often not containing and may be prone to abusive practices. In contrast, foster care is usually associated with better outcomes, including the development of secure new attachments. New interventions to support foster-carers are proving successful, but there is a long way to go in improving institutional care and promoting better alternatives for the most vulnerable children.",

      "title": "The social origins of obesity within and across generations",
      "abstract": "We propose a model for obesity development that traces a considerable part of its origins to the social domain (mainly different forms of prolonged social adversity), both within and across generations, working in tandem with a genetic predisposition. To facilitate overview of social pathways, we place particular focus on three areas that form a cascading sequence: (A) social adversity within the family (parents having a low education, a low social position, poverty and financial insecurity; offspring being exposed to gestational stress, unmet social and emotional needs, abuse, maltreatment and other negative life events, social deprivation and relationship discord); (B) increasing levels of insecurity, negative emotions, chronic stress, and a disruption of energy homeostasis; and (C) weight gain and obesity, eliciting further social stress and weight stigma in both generations. Social adversity, when combined with genetic predisposition, thereby substantially contributes to highly effective transmission of obesity from parents to offspring, as well as to obesity development within current generations. Prevention efforts may benefit from mitigating multiple types of social adversity in individuals, families, and communities, notably poverty and financial strain, and by improving education levels.",

      "title": "THE ADJUSTMENT OF TWO-YEAR-OLDS IN A NOVEL SOCIAL SITUATION1",
      "abstract": "An important indication of social adequacy in young children is their readiness to cope with situations away from home when their mothers and other family members are absent. This study is concerned with the adjustment of two-year-olds to the experience of being separated from home and mother and driven to a nursery school. The situation the children faced involved being taken from home by a woman who was a stranger to them and riding away with other children who were also strangers. This experience not only called for adjusting to a novel social situation but also required the children to face it without the security-giving presence of their mothers. Novel situations tend to be threatening to children, although the reasons for this are not well established. Arsenian (i) proposed that novel situations make children insecure both because their perceptions of the situation are relatively unstructured and because they are uncertain of their capacities to deal with problems which may arise in the situation. Obviously, with repeated experiences in a situation, feelings of insecurity associated with novelty are replaced by feelings of security or insecurity which reflect rewarding or punishing aspects of those experiences. Usually, a young child's mother is his primary source of security in coping with problem situations since she has been involved in meeting his needs in a great variety of situations and since the child can predict her reactions to him with considerable success. Arsenian (i) demonstrated the security-giving value of the mother's presence in her study of children's reactions to being in a strange room. She found that insecurity was highest 1 The writer wishes to acknowledge assistance from members of the Fels Psychology Department, in particular Dr. Virginia Nelson, Dr. Joan Kalhorn Lasko, and Mrs. Anne Preston.",

      "abstract": "The family as a socializing factor stands in the centre of interest of many disciplines, including social and re-social pedagogy. It is one of the most important external factors within the etiology of social deviance; dysfunctional family environment is usually one of the main causes of behavioural disorders. Inter-generational crime, abuse of addictive substances by family members, neglect and abuse, unemployment and social exclusion often appear in the anamnesis of delinquent individuals; educational problems occur in childhood. The family is also an important and often neglected factor in the re-socialization and re-integration of delinquent individuals. It plays a crucial role in the “remedy” and resocialization of individuals in all types of etopedical care facilities – in children's homes with schools, youth detention institutes, educational care centres or in prison (criminal measures), as well as in the treatment by a curator (social curator or curator for children and juveniles), or a probation and mediation officer (probation program, probation supervision). In detention facilities within the penitentiary practice contact with the family is a part of rehabilitation programs, so-called treatment programs. Support of the relationship with the family is also one of the fundamental rights of the convict. In the penitentiary process the family is one of the biggest motivating factors; it may be helpful in the implementing of treatment programs and it helps to maintain the good mental health of convicts. But the family may also represent a negative factor, e.g. in a case of the introduction of illegal goods into prisons or in the case of further negative and undesirable effects on the individual (e.g. inter-generational crime).",

The family’s educational deficiencies are manifested by: the total lack of interest in the child’s education; the excess of care, the indulgence of exaggerated affection; inability to provide the child with positive human models through their own example of behavior; lack of understanding and affection due to selfishness and indifference towards the child; excessive severity, unconscious or intentional, which creates an anxious family climate; the use of acts of violence as educational means.",

Data from a community sample of 199 ethnically diverse mothers revealed that Poor Parenting was related to more Polydrug Problems, more Property Crimes, and less Social Conformity. These correlations were accounted for by a higher order factor of General Deviance, although deviant attitudes did not explain the associations among behaviors. Specific correlations delineated associations between types of parenting and deviance. Adolescent family support and bonding reduced mother's Poor Parenting and was unrelated to other adult deviant behaviors.",

      "abstract": "A review of the literature shows that large family size is related to greater delinquency. The relationship remains when a number of variables, i.e., income, socioeconomic status, parental criminality, and family composition, have been controlled. The higher birth rate for lower classes does not appear to be an adequate explanation for this relationship, nor does less close parent-child affectional ties or less parental supervision although all of these may have some influence. The presence of an “infectious example” may partly account for the relationship, as does overcrowding. Large family size is typically associated with the constellation of undesirable family conditions involving poor role models (e.g., poor parental behaviour, parental criminality, sibling delinquency), poor child-rearing practices (e.g., inadequate parental supervision and discipline), and competition for physical (e.g., overcrowding, low income) and psychological (e.g., lack of attention, affection, family interaction) resources. An immediate solution is to reduce the size of families by helping prospective parents plan their families, and for those who wish it, making medical abortions more readily available. The long-range solution is through research to identify variables which significantly influence the relationship between family size and delinquency. Such studies must control for birth order, sibling spacing, siblings' sex, and sex of the delinquents in these families.",

      "title": "Nurturing for Careers in Drug Use and Crime: Conduct Norms for Children and Juveniles in Crack-Using Households",
      "abstract": "A very sizable proportion of juvenile delinquents and adult criminals come from backgrounds and family kin systems having deviant parents or kin. This paper provides a focus upon the child-rearing practices directly observed by trained ethnographer during a case study of one highly criminal, drug-using household/kin network. The concrete expectations (and actual practices--called conduct norms--with which the household adults respond to (or \"nurture\") children and juveniles are delineated. While children are taught to \"pay attention\" to what adults do, adults typically model various deviant activities and rarely engage in conventional behaviors. Drug-using, and especially crack-using, men and women are expected not to raise (or financially support) children born to them; other kin expect to raise children of such unions. Children are not expected, nor able, to develop strong affective bonds with any household adults, and receive little or no psychological parenting. Adults do not take strong measures to protect children/juveniles from harm, and often adults are a major source of harm. In many ways the conduct norms in such crack-using households are well designed to \"nurture\" those persons who will be antisocial as children, delinquents as juveniles, and become criminals, drug misusers, and prostitutes in adulthood--and who have very few chances to become conventional adults.",

Who was the main person involved as care-taker when he was tiny? Did the child respond to the mother's play and smiles? The questions will not only aim at excluding sensory, auditory or visual defects, but also attempt to assess possible social deviance of the child; answers may perhaps point to sudden changes in responsiveness — such as occur after separation. This may be relevant to the present complaint or may point to longstanding problems. How often and how sudden were separations from the figure of attachment? How long was the separation, and was there a sibling born when the condition developed? (Separations are the rule and not the exceptions in our culture.)",

For some individuals, adaptation within one or more relationships is skewed, or characterized by either an excessive concern for closeness that impedes autonomy (preoccupied stance) or an excessive concern for autonomy that inhibits closeness (avoidant stance). In this study with boys and girls aged 9-14 years, children who reported a preoccupied or avoidant stance toward their mother displayed increased social impairment in the peer group over time. There were predictable associations among children's stances toward mother, father, and best friend. Children resembled their best friend in relationship stance.

Home visitors themselves interact with different personalities; in addition to the baby, they may meet one or more parents, grandparents, other extended family members, neighbors, and friends. The baby can easily get lost among the adults, and the baby’s needs may get lost among adult needs related to poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence, and other risk factors. The home visitor’s desire to prioritize and protect the infant may overwhelm her, interfering with her ability to understand what the family may be communicating through their interactions or their lack thereof. The home visitor’s desire to “do” things for the family runs the risk of blurring professional boundaries and distracting from the focus on the relationship needs of the baby and those who have primary responsibility for the baby.",

Fathers spent less time than mothers in contact with the young. Mother-young contact decreased postnatally, whereas the amounts of mother-young and father-young social interaction, measured in terms of body-nosing exchanges, showed a continuous increase postnatally; sibling interactions also showed a continuous increase. Father-young interactions tended to be dominated by the father. Young reared with the father cohabiting huddled less with their mother, and engaged in less body-nosing, than young reared in the father's absence. Observations suggested that paternal control of the young may curb juvenile interactions. Young observed without their parents in an unfamiliar enclosure did not groom or \"play\" as in their home cage with parents present, but engaged in relatively more vocalizing, neck-nosing and forepaw-clasping.",

      "title": "Living Arrangements Are Not Associated with Length of Hospital Stay",
      "abstract": "People must negotiate with members of their household to fulfill their basic needs. The co-resident domestic group (whether or not family related) is described according to living arrangements.1 Older adults’ living arrangements are depository of critical social roles and represent their immediate network for social interactions.2 In the case of elderly adults and according to reproductive patterns, living arrangements are classified as simple (household sharing with own never-married children) or complex (household sharing with own currently married or formerly married children or with other, unrelated, people).1 Elderly persons living in complex household arrangements have a greater risk of adverse health-related outcomes (mortality, disability, and poor self-reported health status),2-4 whereas those living alone perform better in cognitive evaluations but experience worse health-related quality of life.5, 6 Nevertheless, hospital admission–related outcomes associated with living arrangements of elderly adults are understudied. It was hypothesized that elderly adults with complex living arrangements would be at risk of longer hospital stays than those living in simple households. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from 379 individuals aged 60 and older admitted to an acute care geriatric ward of a tertiary-level hospital in Mexico City from June 2009 to December 2012. A social worker administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding social history that included information on social interactions, genogram, social network, financial situation, and risk factors for elderly mistreatment to every individual within the first 48 hours after admission. Living arrangements were categorized according to the scheme previously described.1 Length of hospital stay was defined as the total number of days from admission to discharge for every individual. Prolonged hospital stay was defined as greater than the 75th percentile (≥16 days). Bivariate analyses were performed to test the association between living arrangement and length of hospital stay. All statistical tests were performed at the .05 level. Mean age of participants was 75.4 ± 8.3 (range 60–100), 63.9% were female, and 24.7% had activity of daily living (ADL) disability; 12.9% lived alone, 31.7% in simple households, and 55.4% in complex households. Median length of hospital stay was 10 days (9 days for simple households, 10 days for living alone, 10 days for complex households; P > .05), 26.4% of the cases had a prolonged hospital stay (≥16 days). Table 1 compares the groups with and without prolonged hospital stay. Having an educational level of less than 6 years (odds ratio (OR) = 1.65), reporting disability in one or more ADLs (OR = 2.00), being admitted through the emergency department (OR = 1.94), having surgery during the admission (OR = 1.99), and being admitted to the intensive care unit (OR = 10.0) were statistically significant correlates of prolonged hospital stay. No difference was found between participants in the prolonged and nonprolonged hospital stay subgroups with respect to living arrangement. Living arrangements are not associated with length of hospital stay in elderly adults. Comorbidity, use of emergency or intensive care services, and surgical procedures were associated with prolonged hospital stay in the present study, as previous work has reported. Educational level was the only social variable associated with this study's main outcome. Older adults’ living arrangements are an example of the interdependency of people and their environment. Individuals’ family coping skills are responsible for an appropriate response to a stressful event such as hospitalization. Nevertheless, the requirements and resources of the household could be modified upon one of its member's hospital admission. The results of the present study suggest that the comprehensive approach of acute geriatric wards could neutralize the effect of social vulnerability on health-related outcomes since professional care secures differential demands. Further study could establish the effect of living arrangements on the success of transitions from hospital to home and on the risk of readmission, to better understand the role of living arrangements as a social determinant of health.

      "abstract": "Ein groser Teil der alteren Bevolkerung lebt relativ zuruckgezogen und ist nur eingeschrankt in das sozialraumliche Umfeld eingebunden. Mit zunehmendem Alter werden die sozialen Netzwerke kleiner und sind starker durch familiare Beziehungen gepragt. Allerdings sind die Familienbezuge raumlich entfernt oder sozial prekar, ebenso Kontakte in die Nachbarschaft oder ins weitere Umfeld im Quartier. Auch wenn Kontakte auf vereinzelte Familienbeziehungen oder auf einen engen Ausschnitt des herkunftskulturellen Milieus konzentriert bleiben, ist eine aktive Teilhabe schwach ausgepragt. Einerseits handelt es sich um einen freiwilligen und bewussten sozialen Ruckzug; andererseits resultieren die Grunde fur das zuruckgezogene Leben aus korperlichen, sozialen und/oder kognitiven Einschrankungen. Die zu Grunde liegenden Bewaltigungsstrategien sind mit dem Risiko sozialer Isolation verbunden und munden in eine reduzierte Lebensqualitat und die Anfalligkeit fur Krankheiten aller Art. \r\nMit zunehmendem Lebensalter treten daruber hinaus neue Fragen auf, die die Orientierung im Alltag alterer Menschen betreffen: Das betrifft beispielsweise das selbstbestimmte Wohnen, die Gestaltung des Wochen- und Tagesablaufs und reicht bis zur Inanspruchnahme von Dienstleistungen. Altere Menschen wissen haufig nicht, an wen sie sich mit ihren Fragen wenden konnen. Vor diesem Hintergrund besteht der Bedarf eines lokalen Lotsensystems, das die Fragen alterer Menschen nicht nur aufnehmen kann, sondern fur sie Anschlusse zu den „richtigen“ Stellen herstellt. \r\nIm Projekt SONA („Seniorenorientierte Navigation“) wurde im Zeitraum 2012-2015 in Zusammenarbeit mit der Sozialverwaltung der Stadt Mulheim an der Ruhr ein Infrastrukturmodell von „Wegweisern“ bzw. „Lotsen“ entwickelt und erprobt, das sowohl die Funktion der Vermittlung von Informationen und Wegen in den verschiedenen Feldern des alltaglichen Lebens als auch die von „Kummerern“ fur Belange alterer Menschen ubernimmt. Gefordert wurde das Projektvorhaben im Rahmen der SILQUA-FH-Forderlinie („Soziale Innovationen im Alter“) des Bundeministeriums fur Bildung und Forschung mit dem Ziel, den Herausforderungen, die sich angesichts des demografischen Wandels ergeben, angemessen Rechnung zu tragen. Im Vordergrund der Forschungsaktivitaten stand die Verbesserung der Lebensqualitat alterer Menschen sowie die Erhaltung und Starkung ihrer Autonomie. \r\nDer vorliegende Abschlussbericht stellt einen integrierten Handlungsrahmen dar, in dem auf zweierlei Wege uber die Ergebnisse des Projekts referiert wird; zum einen werden Erfahrungen und Ergebnisse aus dem Projekt SONA vorgestellt, um sie fur die Wissenschaft und Praxis nutzbar zu machen. Zum anderen werden allgemeine Handlungsempfehlungen ausgesprochen, um die Transfermoglichkeiten des Projekts zu erortern. Zu den zentralen Ergebnissen zahlt in diesem Kontext beispielsweise, dass ein Lotsensystem nur dann nachhaltig verankert werden kann, wenn es eine zentrale Koordinations- und Steuerungsverantwortlichkeit gibt. Daruber hinaus ist die Implementierung eines prozesshaften Qualitatsmanagements empfehlenswert, um die interne Organisation mit den Lotsen und Ansprechpartnern in den Themenfeldern sowie den Kontakt mit den Burgern so zu gestalten, dass auf die Bedurfnisse der verschiedenen Zielgruppen passgenau reagiert werden kann.",

      "title": "Conceptual Challenges in the Study of Caregiver-Care Recipient Relationships",
      "abstract": "Background: In the literature on family caregiving, care receiving and caregiving are generally treated as distinct constructs, suggesting that informal care and support flow in a unidirectional manner from caregiver to care recipient. Yet, informal care dynamics are fundamentally relational and often reciprocal, and caregiving roles can be complex and overlapping. Objectives: To illustrate ways care dynamics may depart from traditional notions of dyadic unidirectional family caregiving and to stimulate a discussion of the implications of complex relational care dynamics for caregiving science. Approach: Exemplar cases of informal care dynamics were drawn from three ongoing and completed investigations involving persons with serious illness and their family caregivers. The selected cases provide examples of three unique, but not uncommon, care exchange patterns: (a) care dyads who are aging, are chronically ill, and who compensate for one another's deficits in reciprocal relationships; (b) patients who present with a constellation of family members and other informal caregivers, as opposed to one primary caregiver; and (c) family care chains whereby a given individual functions as a caregiver to one relative or friend and care recipient to another. Conclusions: These cases illustrate such phenomena as multiple caregivers, shifting and shared caregiving roles, and care recipients as caregivers. As caregiving science enters a new era of complexity and maturity, there is a need for conceptual and methodological approaches that acknowledge, account for, and support the complex, web-like nature of family caregiving configurations. Research that contributes to, and is informed by, a broader understanding of the reality of family caregiving will yield findings that carry greater clinical relevance than has been possible previously.",

      "abstract": "Young people labelled intellectually and/or developmentally disabled (ID/DD) who are making the transition to adulthood often lack control over their lives as restrictions are imposed upon their individual choices and their participation in decisionmaking. For those who have been wards of the child welfare system, this period of transition is made even more difficult by a history of child maltreatment, a lack of familial support, and a dearth of adult living arrangements available to them. Through face-toface interviews with young adults with ID/DD upon leaving child welfare care, and through focus groups with members of the wider ‘community of interest’ (including child welfare social workers, adult protective service workers, foster parents, and residential services staff), this research examined the impacts of residential arrangements and a lack of housing placements upon both the situational and developmental transitioning of young people with ID/DD into adulthood. The consequences for the young person’s physical, mental, emotional and social well-being were related, in the discussions, to issues of choice and control, systemic barriers, devaluation, and rights. This paper focuses specifically on the themes of rights and well-being.",

Correlations among overall amounts of care provided little evidence of cross-time continuity. Consistent with the cumulative risk perspective, Grade 1 self-care and Grade 6 unsupervised peer contact incrementally predicted Grade 6 externalizing problems.

      "title": "Should Visitation Denial Affect the Obligation to Pay Support?",
      "abstract": "When parents do not live together, the relationship between their children and the parent with whom they do not primarily live is often difficult to establish or maintain. In some cases those difficulties may be exacerbated by the custodial parent's resistence to regular contact and visitation with the other parent, expressed through conduct that violates the judicial decree setting forth the custody terms. In other cases substantial impairment in the noncustodial parent's relationship with the child may unavoidably result from custodial-parent conduct that is both lawful and reasonable, such as justified relocation with a young child to a distant location to which the other parent cannot follow. At one time the support obligor might have stopped making payments in either situation, effectively undermining the formal legal rule requiring him to pay, but improvements in the enforcement of child support obligations increasingly exclude that form of self-help. Where impairment in the parent-child relationship arises from noncompliance with the visitation provisions of the custody decree, a possible response is its improved enforcement, but inherent difficulties in the available enforcement tools suggest that this response will always leave some cases unresolved. Nor will enforcement address the question in the relocation context.",

      "title": "POSSIBLE CAUSES OF OVERDEPENDENCY IN YOUNG CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "The American socialization process emphasizes the learning of independence in the childhood years. Perhaps more than in other societies, standing on one's own feet, being able to fend for oneself is an important characteristic of the socialized person in our society. Beginning in early childhood we systematically train our children to attend to their physical needs by themselves (feeding, dressing, toileting), to learn to get along without the mother's continual presence and to learn to take a certain measure of hardship without turning to the socializing agent for help or comfort. But the American socialization process also emphasizes dependence. American parents want their children to turn to them for guidance and to accept their instructions as they attempt to induct the young into the mores of society. It is important for our children to learn a dependency drive-to learn to solve some problems by turning to the adult because the adult knows the approved ways of behaving. Successful socialization, then, involves the acquisition of a culturally approved balance between dependency and independence. Not all children learn the proper balance between these two drives. Some children become overly-dependent upon mother or mother substitute. These are the children who continually seek out adults for their presence, their help, or their approval. They find it hard to grow up and cling tenaciously to their mothers for support. This paper is concerned with causes of overdependency. It reports the results of a study in which 20 young children (six-year-olds) who were rated as being overdependent were compared with 20 young children who served as controls. Two hypotheses were advanced to explain overdependency and each of these was tested in the study: I. Overdependency results from a non-permissive approach to infant disciplines. During the past decade an articulate group of neo-Freudians has advocated a permissive approach to feeding, weaning, toilet training",

      "abstract": "While attachment at an early age is almost exclusively determined by parental behavior, variation in the quality of attachment in adolescence seems strong to be influenced by the complex interplay between the adolescent's internal working model and its environment. To unravel the different sources of variance in adolescent attachment relationships we applied the Social Relations Model. Two parents and two adolescents from 70 relatively well-functioning families reported on their attachment relationships within a family context. In this study, attachment was conceptualized by two different dimensions of attachment, namely anxiety (for being abandoned) and avoidance (of intimacy). Our findings suggest adolescents experience little attachment anxiety throughout adolescence, but they report significantly more attachment avoidance toward their parents. The variance in the quality of adolescents' attachment relationships was mainly determined by characteristics of the adolescent and the unique adjustments they make to the attachment figure.Si bien el apego en los primeros años de vida está casi exclusivamente determinado por la conducta de los padres, la variación de la calidad del apego en la adolescencia parece significativamente influenciada por la interacción compleja entre el modelo de funcionamiento interno del adolescente y su entorno. Para descifrar las diferentes fuentes de varianza en las relaciones de apego de los adolescentes, aplicamos el modelo de relaciones sociales. Dos padres y dos adolescentes de 70 familias con un funcionamiento relativamente bueno informaron sobre sus relaciones de apego dentro de un contexto familiar. En este estudio, el apego se conceptualizó mediante dos aspectos diferentes del apego, por ejemplo, la ansiedad (por ser abandonado) y la evitación (de la intimidad). Nuestros resultados sugieren que los adolescentes sufren poca ansiedad por el apego durante la adolescencia, pero informan una evitación del apego más significativa hacia sus padres. La varianza en la calidad de las relaciones de apego de los adolescentes estuvo determinada principalmente por las características del adolescente y por las adaptaciones únicas que hace a la figura de apego.虽然幼儿阶段的依恋几乎完全由父母的行为决定，但青春期的依恋其质量的差异似乎更强烈地受到青少年自身内部的工作模式和所处环境两者之间复杂的相互作用的影响。为了弄清楚导致青少年依恋关系之差异的各种不同的来源，我们运用了社会关系模型。研究对象来自70个相对正常家庭，每位家庭都有两位父母和两位青少年参与研究，他们报告了他们在家庭环境中的依恋关系。本研究将依恋定义为两个不同维度，即焦虑(因为被忽视)和回避(亲密)。本研究结果表明，青少年在整个青春期很少经历依恋焦虑，但他们对父母回避与其亲密依恋关系倒是明显得多。青少年依恋关系在质量方面的差异主要由青少年自身的特点及其对他们依恋的人所作出的独别的调整决定的。.",

The analysis shows the diversification of the demoralization phenomenon and, most often, the accumulation of risk factors for the emergence of the problem of social maladjustment, with the scarcity of the so-called protective factors. People with disabilities are in a particularly disadvantaged situation, often with a low degree of adaptation, exposed to unfavorable social situations.

The figures tend to show a steadily increasing demand for help with children who cannot live with their biological families for a number of different reasons. This seems to be a reflection of:— Firstly, an increased awareness of the meaning of unusual behaviour in children, i.e., that the child who does something unacceptable like running away, stealing or failing to perform well in school is really showing signs of emotional stress, and secondly, in part due to an increase in social disruption of the family and a change in the values of a significant proportion of middle class parents. There is no way we can expect that all children can spend all their young lives living with a family, either their biological family or an alternative one.",

The term “alienation” is used to refer to a situation “where the child's rejection or resistance of a parent is disproportionate to the child's actual experiences with that parent and the parental separation.” In other words, the child's reaction is inconsistent with the child's own actual observable experience and involves to some extent alienating strategies and behaviors on the part of the favored parent (or perhaps other family members or siblings). This introductory chapter discusses the prevalence of alienation, the prevalence of alienation in community samples, and increase in the number of alienation cases.",

After their initial stay in a children's home, the 26 children in the research group went on to have diverse placement histories throughout their childhood (up to age 18). The children have been divided into 4 subgroups in accordance with the length of time they lived with 1 of their parents or with foster parents. Relationships were 1 of the themes in the primary study as well as in all 8 rounds of follow‐up. This article is based on the 2 most recent rounds when the children had reached the ages of 25 to 30 and 35 to 39. A few of the interviewees talked about a close relationship to 1 of their parents, some had occasional contact, and many more had no contact at all, felt abandoned, or had decided to keep their parent(s) at a distance, not least out of consideration for their own children. The interviews showed that their adult relationship to and/or feelings for parents were still problematic and negatively affected their own well‐being, even if their parent(s) had died.",

Other things being equal, parents with dependent children who experience higher levels of economic stress are more likely to neglect or abuse their children or engage in disciplinary practices which are harsh, erratic and inconsistent. This pattern of parenting behaviour increases the likelihood that children affected by it will gravitate toward or affiliate more strongly with their peers. To the extent that these peers are involved in crime, this association increases the likelihood that susceptible juveniles will become involved in crime. These effects are attenuated when parents facing economic stress are enmeshed in a strong social support network but they are exacerbated in the absence of such a network or when parents face added parenting burdens, such as the absence of a partner (or the presence of an unsupportive partner), marital conflict, a larger number of children, children with behavioural or developmental problems of some kind, or when parents face particular personal problems such as drug addiction or depression.

      "abstract": "I Disruptive behaviors of individuals with Down syndrome may appear in several environments: at home, at school and other social settings. They may become a challenge for parents and professionals because they disrupt the normal dynamics in the family and the classroom, delay the learning progression and become a focus of anxiety to peers and caregivers. Early educative strategies should be applied from infancy into adulthood, so that the each individual might learn coherent and social interactions in an acceptable environment. On the face of a disruptive behavior, it is most important to search for all possible preceding events and circumstances which might trigger that behavior. El sindrome de Down es una discapacidad visible: muestra una manifiesta visibilidad de la deficiencia desde su nacimiento. Esta visibilidad inmediata origina que, en distintas situaciones sociales, otras personas esten pendientes del comportamiento de los ninos y jovenes con sindrome de Down, con una actitud de observacion, directa o disimulada, que a muchos padres puede llegar a incomodar. Hay una especie de “lupa social” pendiente del proceder de quienes tienen trisomia, mezcla, probablemente, de interes, curiosidad y desconfianza. Lo desconocido siempre produce recelo. Esta circunstancia nos obliga, a quienes estamos comprometidos con la plena inclusion social de las personas con sindrome de Down, a ser exigentes con su comportamiento, buscando un desempeno especialmente exquisito en este terreno. Y es que puede darse el caso de que se relacione con la trisomia lo que unicamente tiene que ver con la falta de pautas de conducta adecuadas. Cada nino, joven o adulto que participa en un acto social en un entorno normalizado no solo se representa a si mismo, sino que representa a todas las personas con sindrome de Down que estan intentando encontrar su sitio en la sociedad. El trato normalizado surge cuando se les exige el mismo comportamiento que a cualquier otro en las mismas circunstancias. Compartir derechos y deberes es la mejor forma de favorecer la integracion. Se ha de tener en cuenta que las notas que hacen socialmente visibles a las personas con discapacidad intelectual suelen referirse fundamentalmente a los aspectos de su interaccion interpersonal.

      "abstract": "In kooperativen Brutsystemen bietet das uneigennutzige Verhalten von oft nicht verwandten Helfen eine Unterstutzung fur die Aufzucht der Jungen des Brutpaares. Um als Helfer in einem kooperativen Brutsystem akzeptiert zu werden, muss ein Individuum gewisse soziale Fahigkeiten besitzen, wie zum Beispiel die Fahigkeit sich um die Jungen zu kummern und sich angemessen zu verhalten, um in der Brutfamilie zu bleiben. Diese sozialen Fahigkeiten zeigen oft ein groses Mas an verhaltensbezogener Flexibilitat, wobei das soziale Umfeld, welches ein Individuum in seinem fruhen Leben erfahrt, besonders wichtig fur die korrekte Entwicklung dieser phanotypischen Merkmale zu sein scheint. Vor allem die Interaktionen mit den Eltern und den Geschwistern scheinen eine wichtige Rolle fur die Entwicklung dieser Merkmale zu spielen. Es wurde zum Beispiel gezeigt, dass ein bereichertes soziales Umfeld die soziale Kompetenz erhoht, und im Gegenzug die Aufzucht in einem deprivierten sozialen Umfeld die soziale Kompetenz verringert. Was jedoch unklar bleibt, ist, ob der Einfluss des fruhen sozialen Umfeldes auf genetisch verwandte Individuen beschrankt ist, oder ob fremdartige Zieheltern und -geschwister einen ahnlichen Einfluss auf die Ausbildung sozialer Kompetenz haben konnen.\r\nDie vorliegende Studie untersuchte den Einfluss des fruhen sozialen Umfeldes auf das Wachstum und die Komplexitat des Sozialverhaltens zweier Cichliden gleicher Gattung mit unterschiedlichen Brutsystemen, einerseits bei den biparentalen, monogamen N. caudopunctatus, und andererseits bei den kooperativen Brutern N. pulcher. Genauer gesagt wollten wir herausfinden, ob es moglich ist, das soziale Repertoire und die Komplexitat durch Fremdaufzucht zu erweitern. Wir erwarteten, dass die Spezies mit einem niedrigeren Level sozialer Komplexitat, N. caudopunctatus, ein erweitertes Repertoire an sozialem Verhalten zeigt und sich in sozial herausfordernden Situationen angemessener verhalt, wenn sie in einem bereicherten sozialen Umfeld aufwuchs, als N. caudopunctatus, die in einem naturlichen Umfeld aufwuchsen. Gleichzeitig erwarten wir auch, dass N. pulcher; die in einem sozial deprivierten Umfeld aufwuchsen, ihr sozialverhalten verringern und sich in sozial herausfordernden Situationen weniger angemessen verhalten, als N. pulcher, die in einem naturlichen Umfeld aufwuchsen.\r\nWir konnten zeigen, dass, in einem gewissen Mase, N. caudopunctatus, welche in einem bereicherten sozialen Umfeld aufwuchsen, sich in sozial herausfordernden Situationen angemessener verhalten. Jedoch ist dies vom Kontext abhangig und jener einer Situation prasenter, die die ihrer Aufzucht wiederspiegelt, als in einem Wettstreit um eine Ressource. Wir konnten jedoch ein erweitertes soziales Repertoire nach dem Vorbild von N. pulcher nicht feststellen, was vielleicht auf eine genetische Disposition desgleichen hindeutet und es deshalb fur N. caudopunctatus unmoglich ist, dieses zu erweitern.\r\nDiese Studie bietet einen Nachweis fur die fordernden Auswirkungen eines bereicherten sozialen Umfeldes auf das Verhalten im spateren Leben. Weiters zeigt sie, dass der Einfluss des fruhen sozialen Umfeldes sich nicht auf die Grenzen der Spezies beschrankt, sondern uber diese hinaus reichen kann. Damit reiht sich diese Studie in die stetig wachsende Anzahl an Forschungsarbeiten im Bereich der Verhaltens- und Entwicklungsbiologie ein.",

      "title": "Family Dynamics and Origin of Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "In summary, some of the characteristic forms of family dysfunction related to schizophrenic manifestations that we observed are: (1) failure to form a nuclear family in that one or both parents remain primarily attached to one of his or her parents or siblings; (2) family schisms due to parental strife and lack of role reciprocity; (3) family skews when one dyadic relationship within it dominates family life at the expense of the needs of other members; (4) blurring of generation lines in the family, e.g., (a) when one parent competes with children in skewed families, (b) when one parent establishes a special bond with a child giving substance to the schizophrenic's claim that he or she is more important to a parent than the spouse, and (c) when continued erotization of a parent-child relationship occurs; (5) pervasion of the entire family atmosphere with irrational, usually paranoid, ideation; (6) persistence of conscious incestuous preoccupation and behavior within the group; (7) sociocultural isolation of the family as a concomitant of the six preceding conditions; (8) failure to educate toward and facilitate emancipation of the offspring from the family, a further consequence of points 1–5. (9) handicapping of a child in achieving sexual identity and maturity by the parents' uncertainty over their own sex roles; and (10) presentation to a child of prototypes for identification that are irreconcilable in the necessary process of consolidating his own personality. Intensive work with these families has therapeutic implications which transcend our research plans as such and therewith the scope of this presentation. Other investigators of family dynamics have focused more on this aspect of the schizophrenia problem. The further development of rational psychotherapy, whether with the patient alone or with the family group, will depend upon better understanding and clarification of the complex interrelatedness of family dynamics, ego development, and identity formation. Thus, the study of schizophrenia and the quest for its origins leads us to the question of human development, and better understanding of the latter may illuminate the nature of schizophrenia as well as facilitate the treatment of schizophrenic patients.",

Tim PKM secara intensif mengadakan penyuluhan bagaimana pentingnya selalu membangun pola interaksi dengan berkomunikasi secara baik yang berbasis agama, hasil PKM ini akhirnya tim dapat menyusun buku panduan yang berisi tugas mulia ibu rumahtangga dalam Islan dan dalil-dalil haramnya pergaulan bebas dan narkoba. Kata Kunci : Pola Interaksi , Kontrol Sosial , Berbasis Agama . ABSTRACT Developing patterns of interaction in the community environment naturally starts from how the interaction pattern of the small sphere is done between parents and their children, especially children who are teenagers . If the interaction pattern cannot be carried out consistently, there are often irregularities in adolescent behavior . Parents and all members of the community, as well as village officials synergize and are integrated in carrying out social control for teenagers. Teenagers are very susceptible to being affected by premarital sexual behavior and drug abuse. In certain communities there are some conditions in which certain communities experience a decline in moral values in the younger generation, where adolescents are more susceptible to an impact from lack of social control, such as drug abuse (narcotics), irregularities in relationships (free premarital sex), and other things related to deviations and declining values related to the morality of the child's personality. Interaction as social control in a society where a dynamic communication relationship can occur well between citizens . These conditions are much influenced by several things, lack of attention from parents, lack of planting religious values, lack of motivation to learn / school, and the implications of its free influence in accessing information through increasingly modern technology information, without the lack of internal filters . The PKM team intensively held counseling on how important it is to always build patterns of interaction by communicating well based on religion, the results of this PKM finally the team was able to compile a guidebook containing the noble duties of housewives in Islan and the illicit arguments of promiscuity and drugs. Keywords : Interaction Pattern, Social Control, Religion-Based.",

      "abstract": "L’esperienza livornese si caratterizza per considerare gli interventi di educazione familiare parte integrante del sistema dei servizi all’infanzia 0-6 anni (Nido e altre tipologie 0-3 e scuole dell’infanzia), che oggi, come ogni servizio alla persona, non possono non accogliere bambini e bambine come persone in relazione, prima di tutto, con i genitori e gli altri adulti familiari. E, gia da alcuni anni, dalle famiglie che fruiscono dei servizi educativi per l’infanzia emerge un disagio diffuso, derivato dalla solitudine che caratterizza il vivere contemporaneo (anche per il venir meno di reti parentali, di vicinato ecc.) e che, in parte, e reale isolamento (perche i tempi ed i ritmi del vivere quotidiano lasciano poco spazio all’incontro) mentre, in parte, e anche una chiusura interna (mentale, emotiva), forse riconducibile: 1. alla conflittualita, spesso latente, con la famiglia d’origine (molti/e giovani genitori/genitrici rifiutano il modello genitoriale che hanno sperimentato, senza pero averne un altro a cui riferirsi); 2. alla variabilita che, anche solo come possibilita, investe oggi la vita (per es. lavorativa, che spesso chiede mobilita territoriale; per es. familiare, con separazioni, divorzi, nuovi matrimoni) di donne e uomini, determinando discontinuita e cambiamenti che hanno il sapore certo della perdita, prima di quello della – ancora sconosciuta – conquista; 3. alla diversificazione che sempre piu sembra incidere nei percorsi di vita individuali e comunitari per il definirsi di un «mercato mondiale» non solo dell’economia ma anche della comunicazione e delle conoscenze che – nel «bene» e nel «male» –, offre ai singoli/alle singole proiezioni ed identificazioni anche non condivisi/condivisibili dal/nel contesto di appartenenza.",

Children under three years of age (n = 45) from divorcing or divorced homes were evaluated for visitation/access patterns, attachment to the custodial mother and noncustodial father (based on the mother's report) and psycho-motor development. Fathers who were more involved in early child rearing activities visited more frequently after the separation. Pre-separation conflict was related to irregular post separation visits. A poor pattern of visitation was related to greater delays in language development. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, the results should not be used as a guide to the courts.",

      "abstract": "Latar belakang: Isolasi sosial merupakan faktor ganguan utama dalam \r\nbermasyarakat. Hal ini akibat dari transiensi; norma yang tidak mendukung \r\npendekatan terhadap orang lain; atau tidak menghargai anggota masyarakat yang \r\nkurang produktif, seperti lanjut usia (lansia), orang cacat, dan penderita penyakit \r\nkronis. Isolasi dapat terjadi karena mengadopsi norma, perilaku, dan sistem nilai \r\nyang berbeda dari yang dimiliki budaya mayoritas. Harapan yang tidak realistis \r\nterhadap hubungan merupakan faktor lain yang berkaitan dengan gangguan ini. \r\nTujuan: Mendapatkan gambaran untuk menerapkan asuhan keperawatan pada \r\npasien gangguan jiwa sesuai dengan masalah utama isolasi sosial: menarik diri \r\ndengan cara mengkaji, mengenenal, mengetahui tanda dan gejala yang terpenting \r\ndari gangguan jiwa, memahami penanganan, menerapkan, mengevaluasi dan \r\nmendokumentasikan sebagai tolak ukur guna menerapkan asuhan keperawatan \r\ngangguan masalah utama isolasi sosial: menarik diri. \r\nMasalah Utama Isolasi Sosial: Dalam membina hubungan sosial, individu \r\nberada dalam rentang respons yang adaptif sampai dengan maladaptif. Respons \r\nadaptif merupakan respons yang dapat diterima oleh norma-norma sosial dan \r\nkebudayaan yang secara umum berlaku. Sedangkan respons maladaptif \r\nmerupakan respons yang dilakukan individu dalam menyelesaikan masalah yang \r\nkurang dapat diterima oleh norma sosial dan budaya setempat. \r\nHasil Pembahasan: Setelah dilakukan proses keperawatan didapatkan tiga \r\ndiagnosa keperawatan yaitu resiko perubahan persepsi sensori: halusinasi \r\nberhubungan dengan menarik diri, isolasi sosial: menarik diri berhubungan \r\ndengan harga diri rendah dan defisit perawatan diri: kebersihan diri dan \r\nberpakaian/berhias berhubungan dengan penurunan kemampuan dan motivasi \r\nperawatan diri. \r\nKesimpulan: Saat memberikan asuhan keperawatan pada pasien dengan menarik diri ditemukan adanya perilaku resiko perubahan persepsi sensori: halusinasi \r\nsehingga perlu dilakukan pendekatan secara terus menerus, membina hubungan \r\nsaling percaya yang dapat menciptakan suasana terapeutik dalam pelaksanaan \r\nasuhan keperawatan yang diberikan.",

      "abstract": "The self-reported child-rearing practices of 214 parents of battered babies were characterized in a few but not all respects by demanding behaviour which exceeded that to be expected in relation to their social class and age. Inconsistency in child management was noted in the comparison between lack of demonstrativeness and emotional over-involvement, and between physical punishment and a tendency to be lax in the supervision of the child, and was reminiscent of parents of delinquents. Unhappiness and hostility in relationships with members of their families of origin, with unsupporting partners and with people in general were other important features. Generally, identified perpetrators were characterized by features significant for the sample as a whole.",

      "title": "METODĄ WYCHOWAWCZĄ SPRZYJAJĄCĄ WŁAŚCIWEJ SOCJALIZACJI",
      "abstract": "In the article much attention is paid to issues of appropriate education. Appropriate upbringing means the proper human socialization. Some factors may interfere the upbringing process. These factors can cause adverse changes in human behavior. Improper behavior affects the relationships with family and community. Investigated the most common caretaker in parenting is the biological parent of the child in question, although others may be an older sibling, a grand-parent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle or other family member, or a family friend. Governments and society may have a role in child-rearing as well. In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent blood relations. Others may beadopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage. Parenting skills vary, and a parent with good parenting skills may be referred to as a good parent. Focused on the fact socialization of the child is done by the parents and all who are in contact with the child. Socialization is carried out by various methods of upbringing as observation, imitation, punishments and rewards, and more. A child who observes the people important to him – imitates their habits. Respect for the rights of the child and the assignment of responsibilities – is necessary. This is essential because it introduces the child to the world of precepts, prohibitions, privileges and rights. The article clarified – parenting takes a lot of skill and patience and is constant work and growth. Research shows that children benefit most when their parents: communicate honestly about events or discussions that have happened, and when parents explain clearly to children what happened and how they were involved if they were; stay consistent, as children need structure: parents who have regular routines benefits children incredibly; utilize resources available to them, reaching out into the community; take more interest in their child’s educational needs and early development; and keep open communication and staying educated on what their child is learning and doing and how it is affecting them. Parenting skills are often assumed to be self-evident or naturally present in parents. The conclusion about violations of children’s rights and the lack of responsibility of the child – may distort his morale and social attitudes. This implies a great need to educate parents in this regard.",

      "title": "The Impact of Secure Attachment on Interpersonal Relationship: A Review",
      "abstract": "Attachment has been defined as the psychological bond between a growing child and a caregiver. It is a relationship that develops over a period of time between a child and the caregiver, or any other significant person in the life of a child. It is characterized by intimacy, warmth, and continuity thus eventually becoming the hallmark of all other relationships in the life of a human being. Research has shown that when children experienced secure attachment during their early stages of development in life, they are likely to develop capabilities in exploring the world of interpersonal relationships. Some of the factors that contribute to the diminishing of attachment between children and their caregivers include modernism and post-modernism, family crisis, disability in the life of the mother, death of the caregiver and the scourge of debilitating sicknesses and diseases which incapacitate caregivers. And so it is not uncommon to find individuals who experienced insecure attachment in their childhood having difficulties in their interpersonal relationship as adults. Some of the manifestations of interpersonal relationship difficulty and insecure attachment include low self-esteem, anxiety, inability to trust others, unwillingness to receive help from others, dependence syndrome, aggression, and feeling unloved, among others. However, with timely and appropriate psychological interventions, some of these challenges can be overcome although more research is encouraged in the area of attachment especially in Asia and Africa.",

      "title": "L’isolamento sociale nella quarta età : quali i potenziali fattori maggiormente determinanti : uno sguardo alla quotidianità dei grandi anziani seguiti dal servizio sociale di Pro Senectute di Lugano",
      "abstract": "La tematica affrontata in questo lavoro, ovvero il fenomeno dell’isolamento sociale nella quarta eta nasce dall’esperienza lavorativa svolta presso il servizio sociale di Pro Senectute di Lugano. I grandi anziani (Persone con un’eta superiore o uguale ai 79 anni) appartengono ad una categoria sociale particolarmente colpita da tale fenomeno. Le cause sono ricollegabili a fattori diversi: le difficolta fisiche ed economiche che impediscono la mobilita e comportano il rischio di perdere i contatti sociali, i ricoveri in casa per anziani o i decessi del coniuge o degli amici e/o conoscenti, il mancato riconoscimento di capacita e competenze che provocano all’anziano un senso di inadeguatezza e l’irregolarita dei contatti sociali con i familiari (viene soprattutto fatto riferimento ai figli). Alfine di indagare il fenomeno dell’isolamento sociale e il sentimento di solitudine che colpisce i grandi anziani, la ricerca si focalizza sull’analisi della quotidianita degli intervistati, in particolare ponendo l’attenzione su due gruppi di domande. Il primo relativo all’uso del tempo durante la settimana per lo svolgimento di attivita quotidiane; il secondo riguardante l’analisi del grado di soddisfacimento dell’anziano circa i rapporti con la propria rete formale ed informale. Gli obiettivi dell’indagine empirica sono di poter comprendere quale sia il grado di autonomia degli anziani nello svolgimento delle attivita di vita quotidiana e in quale misura, invece, la fragilita li costringe a chiedere aiuto alla rete formale. Secondariamente, si mette l’accento sull’uso del tempo durante la settimana, per capire se l’anziano tende a vivere attivamente o passivamente il proprio tempo e se desidera poterlo sfruttare diversamente. Da ultimo, viene dedicata una parte alla comprensione del grado di soddisfacimento riguardo alle relazioni con la loro rete formale e/o informale. Partendo da contributi ed approfondimenti teorici, vengono definiti i concetti chiave su cui la tesi fonda le sue radici: l’anzianita, la fragilita dell’anziano, l’isolamento sociale e la solitudine ed infine gli stereotipi legati alla vecchiaia. Lo scritto si avvale su una ricerca qualitativa, basata su sei interviste semi-strutturate, le quali permettono ai soggetti di esprimersi con il proprio linguaggio ma anche di andare in profondita e conoscere alcuni aspetti personali che permettono di indagare in maniera piu ampia l’aspetto dell’isolamento. Attraverso l’osservazione del linguaggio non-verbale e stato infatti possibile cogliere alcuni elementi, quali dispiacere e sconforto ma anche gioia e benessere. La finalita del lavoro e di indagare i fattori riguardanti l’organizzazione della settimana dei grandi anziani, che l’assistente sociale puo cogliere come potenziali fattori maggiormente determinanti dell'isolamento sociale. I risultati testimoniano che l’anziano fragile ricorre maggiormente all’aiuto della rete formale quando quella informale e carente e che nel rapporto con i professionisti ricerca soprattutto sostegno emotivo e relazionale. Secondariamente, emerge la rilevanza che assume la possibilita di mantenere l’autonomia. Si e inoltre potuto appurare che l’anziano puo essere considerato in parte corresponsabile della propria situazione, in quanto la sua attitudine puo portarlo ad isolarsi. La tesi vuole rendere onore ai racconti degli intervistati per permettere a chi la legge di avvicinarsi al ricco mondo dell’anzianita, in particolar modo ai racconti dei sei intervistati senza il rischio di cadere in pregiudizi o di identificare l’anziano secondo gli stereotipi che la societa contemporanea associa spesso alle persone appartenenti a questo gruppo sociale.",

Parental alienating behaviours, such as one parent preventing contact between the other parent and child, are enacted over time with intent to harm the parent-child relationship. Alienated children display characteristics such as psychological splitting and a lack of guilt that help differentiate them from children who have been estranged and have legitimate reasons for rejecting a parent (e.g., the parent was abusive). Alienated children and parents suffer many poor outcomes such as depression, social isolation, and suicidality. Assessment tools and treatment models have shown promise in circumventing the negative effects of parental alienation on individuals' health and well-being.",

In this preregistered study, we show that 11-month-old infants grasp this fundamental aspect about social norms already in their first year. They showed a pupillary surprise response for unexpected social responses, namely the disapproval and exclusion of an individual who showed the same behavior like others or the approval and inclusion of an individual who behaved differently. That preverbal infants link the conformity with others’ behavior to social evaluations, before they respond to norm violations themselves, indicates that the foundations of social norm understanding lie in early infancy.",

Sufficient evidence exists that families who are socially isolated, experience loneliness, and lack social support in both rural and urban settings may be more prone to neglect than matched comparison groups. This article reviews the relationship between neglect and these factors and contrasts models for assessing and intervening with neglectful families. Results suggest that modest improvements in the parenting behavior of neglectful parents can be achieved through the following: (a) differential assessment; (b) a multiservice approach; (c) intense social contacts with a volunteer, lay therapist, or parent aide; (d) use of modeling, coaching, rehearsing, and feedback to improve social interaction skills; (e) development of personal networks; and (f) structured parenting and support groups for socialization, support, and social and parenting skill building.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Social class has a significant impact on childrearing patterns in the United States. Parents in the lower/working class tend to value conformity, which, in turn, impacts the way in which they raise their children. They typically employ a more authoritarian style of parenting, where obedience to rules/authority is expected of children and nonconformity is met with punishment (including, in some cases, spanking). Parents in the middle/upper class, on the other hand, tend to value self‐direction. As a result, they typically use a more permissive style of parenting and encourage their children to negotiate rules and question authority. These differences are important in that they not only impact parent–child relationships, but, also, they likely impact the sorts of occupations children pursue in adulthood, which may affect intergenerational mobility and limit upward movement among children of lower‐ and working‐class parents.",

Dengan begitu banyak kes remaja perempuan yang terlibat dengan tingkah laku tidak terkawal dirujuk oleh ibu bapa mereka untuk tujuan pemulihan kepada pekerja sosial, maka timbul persoalan tentang bagaimana kefungsian keluarga mereka. Justeru kajian kualitatif dengan pendekatan kajian kes ini bertujuan untuk meneroka kefungsian keluarga remaja perempuan tidak terkawal. Pemilihan informan adalah secara persampelan bertujuan, terdiri daripada remaja perempuan berumur 13 hingga 18 tahun yang telah dirujuk ke Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat kerana pelbagai masalah tingkah laku. Hasil kajian menunjukkan terdapat tiga ciri utama ketidakfungsian keluarga remaja perempuan tidak terkawal iaitu (i) sosioekonomi yang rendah; (ii) gaya keibubapaan tidak bersesuaian; dan (iii) tiada role model dalam keluarga. Perkembangan semulajadi remaja turut dilihat sebagai pengalaman yang berkaitan dengan tingkah laku tidak terkawal. Secara umumnya remaja perempuan tidak terkawal bukan sahaja mempunyai keluarga disfungsi, tetapi turut berhadapan dengan cabaran persekitaran negatif dan tidak mampu membuat penyesuaian dengan keluarga tersebut. Kesimpulannya, remaja perempuan yang tidak terkawal berhadapan dengan dilema dan kemelut kerana mempunyai keluarga yang tidak berfungsi. Beberapa cadangan program pemulihan turut diberikan seperti intervensi berasaskan keluarga, pemerkasaan remaja dan keluarga disamping pemantapan nilai-nilai murni, moral dan kerohanian. Ketidakfungsian keluarga turut diambil kira di dalam program intervensi bagi membantu remaja perempuan ke arah yang lebih produktif dan hidup dalam keluarga yang lebih sejahtera.",

      "abstract": "Research is reviewed on family risk factors for youth suicidal behaviors. Both fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors have been linked consistently to negative parent-child relationships (e.g., high conflict, low closeness), child maltreatment, residing with less than two biological parents, and family history of affective and antisocial disorders. Parental separation/divorces and family history of suicidal behavior and alcohol/substance abuse are more strongly associated with completed suicide than with other suicidal symptoms, but family systems problems (such as low cohesion and adaptability) and insecure parent-child attachments are more consistently associated with nonfatal suicidal symptoms than completed suicide. Future research will benefit from attending to the temporal sequencing of putative risk factors and suicidal symptoms and from greater use of observational methods and parental reports.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses social interaction in adolescence. The three major aspects of social interaction in adolescence are: (1) one looks at adolescents' relationships to their parents; (2) one examines the influence of the adolescent's peer group on attitudes, values, and behavior; and (3) one discusses interaction with members of the opposite sex—the phenomenon of dating. Social interaction is a continuous process throughout the life cycle. The emphasis of the social world of the infant is a dependency relationship to one primary caretaker. During childhood, the social emphasis is on a strong attachment bond to parents as well as on nonfamily interaction with groups of peers during the school years. During adolescence, the balance of power between parents and peers in social influence appears to even out. This developmental shift is followed, later in adolescence, by an emphasis on heterosexual interaction. Reciprocal influence between adolescents and parents can be seen in the mode of discipline within a home, established in large part by parents, which influences the behavior of the adolescent. The adolescent's behavior elicits parental discipline. As a consequence, the nature of the relationship between the adolescent and parent is affected.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Children’s physical, cognitive, and emotional maturation require adequate interactions and secure attachment with their primary caregivers. However, the causal relationships between parenting components and infant attachment behaviors remain unclear. New World monkey common marmosets provide an ideal model of human parent-infant relations because, like humans, infant attachment is shared among family caregivers, including parents and older siblings using intricate vocal communications. Combining the natural variations in parenting styles and subsecond-scale microanalyses of dyadic vocal and physical interactions, we demonstrate that marmoset infants signal their need by context-dependent call use and selectively maintain proximity with familiar caregivers. The infant attachment behaviors are individually tuned according to the caregiver’s parenting style; infants keep producing isolation calls when they are carried by rejecting caregivers and exhibit avoidance toward neglectful and rejecting caregivers. Family-deprived infants failed to develop such adaptive uses of attachment behaviors or age-appropriate autonomy and exhibited disorganized attachment behaviors. Thus, marmoset infants shape their ability to modulate their intricate attachment system depending on the caregiver’s attitude through early social interactions with their family caregivers. Demonstrating the significant similarity of the infant attachment system between marmosets and humans, these findings will pave a path to elucidating the neural mechanisms of the infant attachment system.",

      "title": "Adolescent sexual behavior and childbearing",
      "abstract": "Low self esteem does not explain problems of adolescence, particularly unwanted pregnancy and early childbearing. This intimates that their root causes are personal rather than structural and socioeconomic, thereby allowing us to blame the victim. Contrary to popular opinion, few teens (10%) want to conceive and most teens want something other than pregnancy, indicating a need for effective intervention. Teens who were ambivalent about childbearing 2 years earlier are just as likely to have given birth as those who wanted to conceive. Teens self-concept is based on the reality of their environment, which, for most teens who have given birth, involves chronic unemployment, a culture of single parenthood in which men play no supportive role in the home, and the knowledge that teens who choose to continue to attend school despite having given birth fare the same as those who drop out of school. Structural changes (jobs and career goals), long term intervention, and continuous social support are needed to improve a teen's capacity to make choices, especially those concerning contraception. In other words, motivation must be so strong that conceptions are avoided. No family wants to go on welfare and no woman wants to have a baby while a teenager, but when teens become pregnant, they tend not to choose abortion. If welfare reform creates true opportunity for jobs, it will create the motivation to avoid pregnancy but not reduce the childbearing rate among teens that conceive. Very early maturation is correlated with very early onset of sexual activity. The very best sex education and services are unlikely to be offered at a young enough age in schools. US society is obsessed with and unwilling to talk about sex. The notion of choice is not part of poor America. Interactive interventions providing continuing support are needed to make a difference in adolescent pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "The article clarifies that the family is the primary center of personality formation, but in conditions of family dysfunction this process often undergoes significant deformations. A dysfunctional family is a family where normal interaction patterns are disrupted, which leads to chronic stress in the child. The most common consequences are: emotional disorders; aggressiveness or isolation; problems with adaptation in the team; low level of school motivation, etc. In the family, the child receives basic ideas about the world, himself and interaction with others. However, not all families provide the proper conditions for healthy development. Family dysfunctions (alcoholism, violence, emotional alienation, authoritarianism or excessive care) can deeply disrupt the process of socialization of the child. In this context, the role of the psychological service of secondary education institutions is extremely important. School is a place of acquiring knowledge, as well as an important institution of socialization. The child learns to interact with peers, adults, and learns role models. However, if the family does not support these processes or even opposes them, socialization can be distorted. In such situations, psychological services of secondary education institutions act as a kind of «buffer» that helps the child compensate for the deficits of primary socialization with the help of: psychodiagnostics; correctional and developmental work; psychoeducation of teachers and parents; interagency interaction. Family dysfunction is a significant obstacle to the socialization of the child, which can have long-term consequences. However, timely intervention by the school psychological service can significantly affect the negative consequences. Thanks to support, correction, understanding, and professional guidance, specialists help the child adapt to difficult life circumstances and form a healthy «I».",

Yet growing numbers of children are living in stepfamilies and may have perhaps four active parenting adults: the biological parent and stepparent who reside with them, an absent or noncustodial biological parent, and in the cases of complex stepfamilies, the noncustodial parent of the children's stepsiblings. This gap between the legally sanctioned and the real-life experiences of stepfamilies contributes to the ambiguity and uncertainty implicit in relations between the stepfamily and the noncustodial parents. Children with involved nonresidential parents gain by the additional financial support, and the emotional support is correlated with higher school engagement among children. Dominant social myths about stepfamilies and ex-spouses are predicated on anticipations of negativity and triangulation; getting to the point where mutual appreciation and respect are possible might be challenging.",

Both age and sex effects were modified by situational factors such as the nature of the personal activity being engaged in and the sex of the parent or sibling seeking access to the area. Other modifying variables included the size of the home (less privacy is afforded children in smaller homes with fewer facilities); family density (higher levels of privacy are associated with high- and low-density homes and less privacy use was found in moderately dense homes); and, finally, mother's child-rearing practices (such as restrictive, coercive mothers exercise more control over children's privacy habits.

As a consequence of this, more and more children are becoming emotionally disturbed as a result of poor mother-child interactions that arise as early as infancy. With several cases of poor interaction, hospital treatment was undertaken to establish emotional mutuality between mother and child through therapeutically induced regression into infancy. Each mother-child pair was hospitalized in the baby unit of the pediatric ward, and the mother provided consistent emotional availability to her child. The child then regressed into infantile states that involved the following four phases: (1) The child began to interact with her mother more actively; (2) she became demanding, like a toddler in the rapproachment crisis; (3) the mother's sustained acceptance won the trust of her child, who began to show a strong attachment to her; (4) the child began to progress to a stage appropriate to her age and used the mother as a secure home base. Each child lost previous symptoms and acquired a stable character. This approach, which utilized the Japanese affinity for intimacy and regression, proved effective in the management of psychopathologies rooted in infancy.",

They need guidelines for managing this situation. Parents often find it difficult to understand the concept of innate competition between siblings and to accept some conflict as common in healthy families regardless of how loving, clever, persistent, and available adults may be. The pediatrician is in a unique position to intervene because of the frequent contacts with the family.Many potential situations should alert both parents and physicians to a potential problem, including: the sibling reaching significant milestones (eg, walking); change in status (eg, no longer being the oldest, only, or youngest child); change in health status of sibling (eg, injury, malignant illness, identification of disabilities); and change involving a significant adult (eg, illness, death, divorce, job loss, change in caregiver).History taking is essential and can be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. It should include inquiry about who is involved (both children and adults) and their perceived roles; the reporter and most frequent observer; time, situation, and place of occurrence; significance attached to the problem by each of the parents; other occurrences in the entire household regarding relationships; why this problem is receiving attention now and not earlier; and any long-term concerns.",

      "abstract": "The paper examines psychological factors victim behaviour. The definition of victim behaviour is given and it is emphasized that such conduct is not necessarily passive behaviour of the victim. Victimization and behaviour can be active and aggressive. It is shown that antisocial, deviant behaviour of children and adolescents seriously increases the risk of victimization. Family as the most important institution of socialization is considered both as a preventing factor and risk factor of victim behaviour. The role of the family in shaping the victim behaviour is revealed in the following issues: aggressive, conflict behaviour is personal inclination or absence of the “proper” skills; interdependence of the severity of punishment and child aggression; punishment for child aggression (between siblings): what is the result?; ignoring aggression is it the best solution?; victims of sexual violence and causes of victim behaviour; demonstrative accentuation as a risk factor in rape victim behaviour; happy family can it be a risk factor for victim behaviour? For a long time, social deviant personality development has been believed to deal with structural deformation of the family, which is defined as a single-parent family, i.e. absence of one parent (usually the father). It is now proved that the major factor of family negative impact on personal development is not structural but psychosocial family deformation. A really happy family, psychologically happy family is the cornerstone of preventing victim behaviour. The victim behaviour being mainly determined by personal qualities does not negate this conclusion, but only strengthens it, as the qualities mentioned above are shaped in many respects within family socialization, are determined by family upbringing styles and features of interpersonal relationships inside the family.",

By reconstructing the preceding day with the aged subjects, we were able to provide relatively precise behavioral measures of social contact. Per day in the average 3 to 5 hours of the up to 15 hours waking-time were spent with social contacts. These behavioral measures draw a quite differentiated picture of the institutions, which corresponds less to the image, usually ascribed to the specific housing categories, but seems to be more influenced by certain aspects of their social and physical environment. Interesting relations between social behavior and life-satisfaction show up in our population of aged people. While correlations between life-satisfaction and realized contacts with different kinds of partners (eg. friends, relatives, neighbors) are neglectible, the amount of group-contact--either selfinitiated or offered by the administration--shows consistent and rather close connections to different measures of life-satisfaction. If these results could be replicated in consecutive studies, they would imply important practical consequences.",

      "abstract": "Primates, particularly females, tend to be attracted to infants that are not their own and are often highly motivated to touch and handle them. However, species vary markedly in forms of handling and extents to which handling constitutes direct care (e.g., carrying and nursing), other affiliative behaviors, or aggression/ abuse. Here we review infant handling among primates from ultimate and proximate perspectives, focusing on a promising, but understudied hypothesized benefit—that handling enhances social bonds. We pay special attention to macaques and baboons, because infant handling in most of these species poses a special challenge in that it involves little actual care, and hence may be shaped by different and as yet unclear selective pressures from typical alloparental care. Costs, benefits, and hypothesized functions appear to vary across species based on: a) individuals’ roles (mother, handler, and infant), b) each of their characteristics, c) relationships between handlers and mothers, and d) the social context within the group. As a result, observed patterns of handling appear to be complex outcomes of the interaction of different, sometimes conflicting interests. The most promising hypotheses based on short/ medium term benefits appear to vary with breeding system, reproductive biology, socioecological factors, and life history characteristics. Explanations based on life history variables or long-term evolutionary processes related to cooperation appear to have broader applications, but nevertheless fail to explain infant handling in all its manifestations. We end by calling for more quantitative comparative and longitudinal research to further elucidate our understanding of this puzzling behavior.",

      "title": "Implementing changes in institutions to improve young children's development",
      "abstract": "Abstract An estimated 8‐million children, mostly birth to approximately 6 to 8 years of age, live in institutions worldwide. While institutional environments vary, certain characteristics are common, including relatively large groups; high children:caregiver ratios; many and frequently changing caregivers; homogeneous grouping by age and disability status; periodic graduations to new groups of peers and caregivers; and an “institutional style of caregiving'' that minimizes talking, provides rather dispassionate perfunctory care, and offers little warm, sensitive, contingently responsive caregiver–child interactions. The development of children in residence is usually delayed, sometimes extremely so, in every physical and behavioral domain. Although efforts are being made in many countries to care for children without permanent parents in family environments (e.g., domestic adoption, foster and kinship care, reunification with biological parents), it is not likely that transitions to family alternatives will be completed in all countries in the near future; thus, institutions are likely to exist for many years, if not decades. But institutions need not operate in the current manner; they can be modified to be substantially more family‐like in structure and in the behavior of caregivers. Research has indicated that when such changes are made, the development of children, both typically developing and those with special needs, is improved substantially. Based on the available literature and the authors' experience, this article describes steps that can be taken to implement such changes in residential institutions for infants and young children.",

      "title": "Drugs, homelessness and the out of home care system: Being kicked out of home again?",
      "abstract": "Substance abuse affects many young people who living in out of home care and their exit from the child protection system at age 18. These young people often have generational substance abuse in their families, or are further introduced to substances by other young people in the system. Many are struggling with issues around abuse from their families, emerging mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, and post traumatic stress and attachment issues. In addition, many have low educational levels, low intellectual functioning, and struggle to operate in positive peer groups or social environments. Living in the residential care system usually means mixing with other young people of similar backgrounds, with challenging behaviours, including alcohol, inhalant and cannabis use. The residential care system has a tough job; to manage these young people who are often returning home substance affected, which leads to aggressive behaviours towards both staff and other young people. Multiple placements are the norm for young people in out of home care, as they are often moved around according to their need for supervision, the client mix, and the availability of beds. Subsequently, the continuity of attachments to workers and carers is often interrupted, and the young people become more cynical and difficult to engage in service provision.",

      "title": "Special Needs Adoptive Families: A Study of Social Supports and Family Functioning",
      "abstract": "As a result of recent federal initiatives, more have become available for adoption, and many of these enter their new families with a variety of needs. Special needs adoptees have been defined as children who have experienced physical or sexual abuse and/or severe neglect; with physical or emotional disabilities; who are older than one year; and who are members of a sibling group who are placed together with the same adoptive (Mullin & Johnson, 1999, p. 590). Often, special needs adoptive evidence psychological and emotional difficulties that can be very challenging to the adoptive family. These and their families may require a number of services and different types of support to assist with the transition of integrating the adopted child into the family and to assist family members as they move through new developmental stages. In addition, parents' needs for support may vary based on the special needs of the adopted child and/or may vary based on their prior experiences (or lack of) as foster parents or adoptive parents. This study used Urie Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Theory (1977, 1988, 1989) as a framework to conceptualize the study of social supports in special needs adoptive families. An ecological perspective recognizes the role of the environment in familial development and recognizes that the family is a complex system that interacts with other complex systems. Differences in support availability, use, need, and helpfulness were examined based on 125 parents' reports. One-way ANOVAs revealed significant differences in support needs based on parent experience and special need categories of children. Parents with foster and/or adoptive experience reported higher availability of supports overall than parents without experience. Parents without foster or adoptive experience reported lower use and higher need of supports overall than parents with experience. Parents of with physical/developmental disabilities reported higher use of services overall than parents of with behavioral/emotional disabilities/difficulties or parents of with both types of disabilities/difficulties. Significant correlations were found between support availability and the Family Environment Scale (FES) subscale of Conflict and support need and the FES subscale of Conflict, suggesting a relationship between family environment and supports.",

      "title": "Qualitative examination of homecoming experiences among active-duty military fathers during reintegration",
      "abstract": "Active-duty military fathers are frequently away from their families throughout their military career and are faced with readjusting to family and garrison life after each separation. For fathers of very young children, reintegration can have unique challenges due to the tremendous developmental progression occurring in early childhood and the impact of lengthy deployment separations. While much of the research on military families focuses on extreme negative experiences (e.g., reactions to war injuries and posttraumatic stress disorder), little is known about the common experiences of military families. This qualitative study explores the reintegration experiences of 15 active-duty U.S. Army fathers with a child under six in their home during the deployment. Homecoming experiences were coded and analyzed to distinguish four adjustment factors and five adaptation challenges. Most fathers described having mixed experiences during reintegration, with 93% referencing at least one factor making adjustment easier (e.g., communication with their spouse during deployment), and 80% referencing at least one factor making adjustment difficult (e.g., child’s initial hesitation or perceived rejection). Adjustment facilitators included: spending quality time with family, individual and family growth, quality communication during deployment, and the service member’s parental perspective taking. Challenges to adjustment included negative postdeployment reactions of children, difficulty readjusting to family and civilian life, and service member psychological changes. These findings expand our understanding of the reintegration experience of active-duty fathers with young children and identify common challenges and facilitators that can be addressed through culturally informed supportive services across the deployment cycle.",

      "abstract": "The social relationships that individuals experience at different life stages have a non-negligible influence on their lives, and this is particularly true for group living animals. The long lifespan of many primates makes it likely that these animals have various tactics of social interaction to adapt to complex changes in environmental or physical conditions. The different strategies used in social interaction by individuals at different life stages, and whether the position (central or peripheral) or role (initiator or recipient) of an individual in the group social network changes with age, are intriguing questions that remain to be investigated. We used social network analysis to examine age-related differences in social interaction patterns, social roles, and social positions in three affiliative social networks (approach, allogrooming, and social play) in a group of wild rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Our results showed that social interaction patterns of rhesus macaques differ between age classes in the following ways: i) young individuals tend to allocate social time to a high number of groupmates, older individuals prefer to focus on fewer, specific partners; ii) as they grow older, individuals tend to be recipients in approach interactions and initiators in grooming interactions; and iii) regardless of the different social interaction strategies, individuals of all ages occupy a central position in the group. These results reveal a possible key role played by immature individuals in group social communication, a little-explored issue which deserves closer investigation in future research.",

      "abstract": "Young people often find deviant behavior. Deviant behavior is the result of an imperfect socialization process. The most vulnerable groups in the process of deviant behavior are young people. This can be overcome if the function of the family goes well, because the family is a function of socialization for family members, especially children, because the first time a child is born is in the family which is the first and main institution. In accordance with the problems stated earlier, the focus of the research is emphasized to determine the form of deviant behavior among young people in the era of modernization and what is the role of parents in overcoming it. Data collection techniques and data processing in descriptive qualitative research can be carried out in various forms, namely through observations, interviews and documentation. The conclusions of the research results show that: 1) Parental functioning is very influential, because most young people do deviant behavior, namely children who do not receive full attention and affection from their parents, 2) Forms of deviant behavior among young people exist as young people written in the theoretical concept, there are three forms of deviant behavior, namely: a) non-conforming actions: such as going out of the house without saying goodbye, coming home late, smoking, etc .; b) Anti-social or asocial acts such as wild blapan, drinking; and c) Criminal acts such as reading and watching pornographic videos, extramarital sex, narcotics. 3) The factor of cultural shifts and individualistic attitudes also has an influence, this is reflected because people are starting to abandon behaviors and cultures that reflect solidarity and mutual cooperation.",

      "title": "(Positive) power to the child: The role of children's willing stance toward parents in developmental cascades from toddler age to early preadolescence",
      "abstract": "Abstract In a change from the once-dominant view of children as passive in the parent-led process of socialization, children are now seen as active agents who can considerably influence that process. However, these newer perspectives typically focus on the child's antagonistic influence, due either to a difficult temperament or aversive, resistant, negative behaviors that elicit adversarial responses from the parent and lead to future coercive cascades in the relationship. Children's capacity to act as receptive, willing, even enthusiastic, active socialization agents is largely overlooked. Informed by attachment theory and other relational perspectives, we depict children as able to adopt an active willing stance and to exert robust positive influence in the mutually cooperative socialization enterprise. A longitudinal study of 100 community families (mothers, fathers, and children) demonstrates that willing stance (a) is a latent construct, observable in diverse parent–child contexts, parallel at 38, 52, and 67 months and longitudinally stable; (b) originates within an early secure parent–child relationship at 25 months; and (c) promotes a positive future cascade toward adaptive outcomes at age 10. The outcomes include the parent's observed and child-reported positive, responsive behavior, as well as child-reported internal obligation to obey the parent and parent-reported low level of child behavior problems. The construct of willing stance has implications for basic research in typical socialization and in developmental psychopathology as well as for prevention and intervention.",

      "title": "Ergoterapia e maltrattamento infantile: il ruolodell’ergoterapista nella promozione del benessereoccupazionale di bambini con esperienza di trascuratezzanella prima infanzia",
      "abstract": "Background: La trascuratezza infantile e un atto offensivo oppure omissione confermati o sospetti da parte del genitore o da parte del caregiver che depriva il bambino delle sue necessita di base e di conseguenza causa, o puo causare, danni fisici o psicologici al bambino. Nella trascuratezza infantile i bisogni del bambino non sono soddisfatti o non lo sono in misura sufficiente. Si tratta di un fenomeno molto vasto che puo riguardare bisogni fisici, come ad esempio l’alimentazione, le cure o la salute; ma anche emotivi come il bisogno del bambino di stimoli relazionali, d’amore, d’accettazione e di incoraggiamento. Le conseguenze della trascuratezza sullo sviluppo del bambino e nelle sue attivita di vita quotidiana sono molteplici e dipendono anche dal tipo di bisogno trascurato. La deprivazione dei bisogni fondamentali nel bambino puo provocare ritardi dello sviluppo o sviluppo disarmonico in diverse aree evolutive, limitando la performance ed il benessere occupazionale del bambino nelle sue co-occupazioni. \r\n\r\nObiettivi: Lo scopo di questo Lavoro di Tesi e quello di indagare il ruolo dell’ergoterapista nella promozione del benessere occupazionale di bambini con vissuto di trascuratezza durante la prima infanzia (0 – 4 anni) nel contesto ticinese. \r\n\r\nMetodologia: La metodologia utilizzata e l’intervista qualitativa di tipo semi-standardizzato. Per questo Lavoro e stata svolta un’intervista ad un ergoterapista che lavora sul territorio ticinese nell’ambito pediatrico con la fascia d’eta della prima infanzia. L’intervista svolta e stata analizzata tramite un’analisi tematica di tipo induttivo per individuare i temi rilevanti inerenti al ruolo dell’ergoterapista nell’intervento con bambini che hanno esperienza di trascuratezza precoce. Vista la delicatezza del tema, l’intervista e stata sottoposta ad un processo di anonimizzazione per mantenere un approccio etico alla ricerca ed un rispetto della privacy delle persone coinvolte. \r\n\r\nRisultati: L’ergoterapista ticinese sembrerebbe confrontato sempre piu spesso con situazioni di trascuratezza e maltrattamento. L’analisi dell’intervista con l’ergoterapista ha fatto emergere alcuni temi importanti nella presa a carico di bambini con vissuto di trascuratezza tra cui la collaborazione interdisciplinare e di rete ed il coinvolgimento della famiglia nel progetto terapeutico del bambino. Nell’intervista la figura dell’ergoterapista viene valorizzata sia nell’ambito della prevenzione, che nella presa a carico dei bambini con esperienza di trascuratezza. \r\n\r\nConclusioni: Il ruolo dell’ergoterapista nella presa a carico di bambini con esperienza di trascuratezza e ancora scarsamente esplorato in letteratura e necessita di essere approfondito. L’intervista svolta ha permesso di individuare alcuni importanti caratteristiche nel ruolo dell’ergoterapista nell’ambito della trascuratezza infantile, ovvero l’intervento precoce, la collaborazione interdisciplinare e l’approccio di prevenzione. Nella presa a carico di bambini con esperienza di trascuratezza dai 0 – 4 anni nel contesto ticinese appare importante utilizzare un approccio centrato sulla famiglia ed un intervento con e per il genitore, considerando i setting ecologici di vita del bambino al fine di promuovere le sue capacita nelle diverse aree dello sviluppo e quindi anche il benessere nelle sue co-occupazioni. \r\n\r\nKeywords: occupational therapy, role, child neglect, child maltreatment, early intervention, prevention, family centered approach, multidisciplinary team, occupational well-being",

Some cultures normalize ACEs and IPV. Life events can require adaptation to a new identity or environment, involving acculturative stress and sometimes family distancing. These include not only immigration but also migration within countries, changes in socioeconomic class, the onset of major illness or disability, changes in family composition, and aging. Acculturation is most successful when people become bicultural, integrating old and new identities. Depression risk is greatest when people feel isolated: disconnected from both their native culture and that of their new environment. Second-generation immigrants can experience “acculturative family distancing.” Effective psychotherapy of depression often requires addressing acculturation-related issues and recognition of traumas and stresses normalized by a patient’s native culture.",

Today, more than two thirds of Black infants are born to unmarried mothers. Even if unmarried fathers are actively involved initially, their involvement over time declines. We identified multiple barriers to, and supports of, father involvement at multiple levels. These levels include intrapersonal (eg, human capital, attitudes and beliefs about parenting), interpersonal (eg, the father's relationships with the mother and maternal grandmother), neighborhoods and communities (eg, high unemployment and incarceration rates), cultural or societal (eg, popular cultural perceptions of Black fathers as expendable and irresponsible, racial stratification and institutionalized racism), policy (eg, Earned Income Tax Credit, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child support enforcement), and life-course factors (eg, father involvement by the father's father). We found strong evidence of success for several intervention programs (eg, Reducing the Risk, Teen Outreach Program, and Children's Aid Society - Carrera Program) designed to prevent formation of father-absent families, but less is known about the effectiveness of programs to encourage greater father involvement because of a lack of rigorous research design and evaluation for most programs.A multi-level, life-course approach is needed to strengthen the capacity of African American men to promote greater involvement in pregnancy and parenting as they become fathers.",

      "title": "Joint Attention in Human and Chimpanzee Infants in Varied Socio‐Ecological Contexts",
      "abstract": "Abstract Joint attention (JA) is an early manifestation of social cognition, commonly described as interactions in which an infant looks or gestures to an adult female to share attention about an object, within a positive emotional atmosphere. We label this description the JA phenotype . We argue that characterizing JA in this way reflects unexamined assumptions which are, in part, due to past developmental researchers' primary focus on western, middle‐class infants and families. We describe a range of cultural variations in caregiving practices, socialization goals, and parenting ethnotheories as an essential initial step in viewing joint attention within inclusive and contextualized perspectives. We begin the process of conducting a decolonized study of JA by considering the core construct of joint attention (i.e., triadic connectedness) and adopting culturally inclusive definitions (labeled joint engagement [JE]). Our JE definitions allow for attention and engagement to be expressed in visual and tactile modalities (e.g., for infants experiencing distal or proximal caregiving), with various social partners (e.g., peers, older siblings, mothers), with a range of shared topics (e.g., representing diverse socialization goals, and socio‐ecologies with and without toys), and with a range of emotional tone (e.g., for infants living in cultures valuing calmness and low arousal, and those valuing exuberance). Our definition of JE includes initiations from either partner (to include priorities for adult‐led or child‐led interactions). Our next foundational step is making an ecological commitment to naturalistic observations (Dahl, 2017, Child Dev Perspect, 11 (2), 79–84): We measure JE while infants interact within their own physical and social ecologies. This commitment allows us to describe JE as it occurs in everyday contexts, without constraints imposed by researchers. Next, we sample multiple groups of infants drawn from diverse socio‐ecological settings. Moreover, we include diverse samples of chimpanzee infants to compare with diverse samples of human infants, to investigate the extent to which JE is unique to humans, and to document diversity both within and between species. We sampled human infants living in three diverse settings. U.K. infants ( n = 8) were from western, middle‐class families living near universities in the south of England. Nso infants ( n = 12) were from communities of subsistence farmers in Cameroon, Africa. Aka infants ( n = 10) were from foraging communities in the tropical rain forests of Central African Republic, Africa. We coded behavioral details of JE from videotaped observations (taken between 2004 and 2010). JE occurred in the majority of coded intervals ( Mdn = 68%), supporting a conclusion that JE is normative for human infants. The JA phenotype, in contrast, was infrequent, and significantly more common in the U.K. ( Mdn = 10%) than the other groups ( Mdn &lt; 3%). We found significant within‐species diversity in JE phenotypes (i.e., configurations of predominant forms of JE characteristics). We conclude that triadic connectedness is very common in human infants, but there is significant contextualization of behavioral forms of JE. We also studied chimpanzee infants living in diverse socio‐ecologies. The PRI/Zoo chimpanzee infants ( n = 7) were from captive, stable groups of mixed ages and sexes, and included 4 infants from the Chester Zoo, U.K. and 3 from the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Japan. The Gombe chimpanzee infants ( n = 12) were living in a dynamically changing, wild community in the Gombe National Park, Tanzania, Africa. Additionally, we include two Home chimpanzee infants who were reared from birth by a female scientist, in the combined U.S., middle‐class contexts of home and university cognition laboratory. JE was coded from videotaped observations (taken between 1993 and 2006). JE occurred during the majority of coded intervals ( Mdn = 64%), consistent with the position that JE is normative for chimpanzee infants. The JA phenotype, in contrast, was rare, but more commonly observed in the two Home chimpanzee infants (in 8% and 2% of intervals) than in other chimpanzee groups ( Mdns = 0%). We found within‐species diversity in the configurations comprising the JE phenotypes. We conclude that triadic connectedness is very common in chimpanzee infants, but behavioral forms of joint engagement are contextualized. We compared JE across species, and found no species‐uniqueness in behavioral forms, JE characteristics, or JE phenotypes. Both human and chimpanzee infants develop contextualized social cognition. Within‐species diversity is embraced when triadic connectedness is described with culturally inclusive definitions. In contrast, restricting definitions to the JA phenotype privileges a behavioral form most valued in western, middle‐class socio‐ecologies, irrespective of whether the interactions involve human or chimpanzee infants. Our study presents a model for how to decolonize an important topic in developmental psychology. Decolonization is accomplished by defining the phenomenon inclusively, embracing diversity in sampling, challenging claims of human‐uniqueness, and having an ecological commitment to observe infant social cognition as it occurs within everyday socio‐ecological contexts. It is essential that evolutionary and developmental theories of social cognition are re‐built on more inclusive and decolonized empirical foundations.",

      "abstract": "Study of the personalities of fathers of schizophrenic patients and their roles in the family has shown that few, if any, have filled the paternal role usually expected in middle-and upper-class families, and many exerted seriously pathogenic influences upon the family structure and upon the rearing of the children. There is no one type of father who exerts this deleterious influence and who can properly be termed a schizophrenogenic father; however, we have tentatively grouped these fathers into 3 or 4 categories, a grouping which we realize is not all-inclusive: (1) Fathers of schizophrenic daughters—constantly in battle with their wives who do not fulfill their rigid and distorted expectations, and struggling to gain the daughters to follow their patterns while sabotaging the wives as mothers; (2) fathers who cannot endure the rivalry of a son for the wives' attention and who impede the wives' efforts at mothering while derogating the sons; (3) passive fathers who are nonentities in the home, who do not fill their wives' ideals for a male, and furnish little in the way of acceptable patterns for their sons to follow. Some of this group have never filled the masculine role in the home, while some have failed, lost self-esteem, and left the families for the mothers to guide without support. The role of the mother is not considered in this paper, which seeks only to highlight the difficulties produced by the fathers.",

An agemate was present for half the children but not the others. Peer presence facilitated leaving the mother and entering the playroom at both ages. Among 18-month-olds, the presence of the peer also shortened play bouts, increased unoccupied/self-solace behavior, and increased contact maintenance with the mother. Among 30-month-olds, however, the peer's presence did not have these effects. these children engaged in increased coordinate social interaction with the other child. Developmental changes occurring in the second and third year thus include the increased salience of agemates in supporting separation from the mother and exploration of the environment in the context of sustained social interaction.",

Non-compliant parents are seen as causing problems for governments and social workers as they impede the changes necessary for children to grow up safely within their families and potentially consume large amounts of public money. The non-compliant parent was present in both studies in slightly different variations. In the original study, non-compliance was attributed to parents’ unwillingness to engage and thereby failing their children. In the replication study, there was greater acknowledgement that the complex needs and life situations of parents might prevent engagement. The replication study also introduced the deliberately misleading non-compliant parent who goes through the motions to keep social workers happy without making lasting changes. This is often referred to as disguised compliance. Two responses by social workers to non-engagement are presented: control and support.",

      "title": "Shifting practice in domestic violence",
      "abstract": "Child protection services have struggled with domestic and family violence (DV) and how to respond to it. Historically it has been slow to recognise the impact of domestic violence on children. Once identified, child protection services have been slow to recognise that affected children are usually best safeguarded by workers supporting the non-offending parent, typically, the child's mother in situations of DFV. The focus on assessing mothers for their protection or failure to protect their children in the face of fathers who use violence has become characteristic of much child protection practice which has failed to engage constructively with the challenges of domestic violence. Many issues have emerged as problematic, highlighting the poor 'fit' between the traditional child protection lens and the demands of an effective response to domestic violence. These include: an exclusive focus on the 'best interests' of the child without due regard for two victims of domestic violence (child and usually the child's mother); the lack of engagement with fathers who use violence; the necessities of engaging with diverse communities; the problems with developing effective domestic violence interventions when separation has not occurred. These are not the problems of an individual practitioner, but rather point to the structural and cultural change required by organisations to support workers to shift their practice. This chapter will draw on recent research (a national case reading of child protection files in Australia) to highlight the gaps in understanding the impacts of DV on parenting skills, and the gaps in recognising and documenting mothers' strengths and efforts to keep their children safe. Sometimes this has involved mothers being deemed as 'non-compliant' with child protection instructions. An intersectional lens will be taken to explore a feminist perspective on child protection practice. The framework developed by Safe & Together™ will be used to inform the chapter and bring a feminist lens which is inclusive of the needs of children for agency, safety and protection. There is evidence that supporting the mother–child relationship is the most effective way of keeping children safe where there is domestic violence. Strategies required at an organisational and a practitioner level will be explored, including the need for a differential response to children exposed to DFV. This response recognises that not all children are significantly affected by DFV and not all mothers find their parenting significantly compromised. While partnering with mothers, it should be recognised that children may have different perspectives on violence and have their own views about what keeps them safe.",

The policy comments on five areas of concern: 1) Caring for ones' own or relatives' or friends' children is fraught with ethical issues, such as confidentiality, and should be avoided except for minor conditions or emergencies; 2) Anything more than modest gifts can adversely affect appropriate boundaries; 3) Romantic and sexual relationships with a patient represent a serious breach in a therapeutic relationship and, thus, such relations are always inappropriate, and romantic relationships with a patient's family members also should be avoided; 4) Inadvertent sexuality in the pediatrician-patient relationship can occur during demonstrations of affection or empathy through body language and verbal expression, so the pediatrician should strive for a warm, friendly relationship while avoiding untoward personal intimacy; and 5) Nonmonetary payments, such as exchange of services or barter, must be approached cautiously because questions of adequate compensation and increased personal contact can impair the professional relationship.\n\nSome of these issues of boundary, in particular items 1, 2, and 5, can have different implications in a small town, where closer ties may be unavoidable and even may enhance the professional relationship.

In their simplest forms, the distress and functional impairment of the ill family member are felt on a daily basis by others in the household – in ways that range from empathizing with the distress, to disruption of interpersonal relationships within the family, to compromised family functioning in which tasks of daily life are not accomplished. At a more complex level, when the mentally ill family member is a parent, there are well-established risks for the children in that family. Rates of mental illness are higher throughout the children's lifespan (particularly during the typical risk periods for mental illnesses), difficulties in school are more frequent, and problems in general social adjustment (such as delinquent behavior) are manifest. Still, the mechanisms by which this risk is manifest remain obscure.",

      "abstract": "Among the elements that characterize society and the family today, one aspect has emerged with an especially high profile in the last few decades: infertility in human couples has become part of the everyday scene, together with other phenomena, such as young people leaving home much later or the delay in the formation of new families –and above all in the decision to have children, which may be left until advanced ages; indeed, among young people there is even some degree of identification with “non-natural” models of fertility, assisted reproduction techniques being considered as an initial option that excludes “complications” such as meeting a suitable sexual partner, or even pregnancy and childbirth. Going beyond the reproductive revolution represented by the FIV (1978) and ICSI (1992) methods, there are currently as many as 39 reproduction methods that do not involve a normal sexual union (Burns, 2005). The social trend towards delaying the entry into adulthood, with hyper-protective family models, and their corollary, the delay in young people becoming parents, has a reverse side: infertility, a multidimensional crisis that affects all systems (individual, couple, family) and levels (psychophysiological, sense of self, relationship with others, etc.), triggering high levels of stress, with a wide range of negative emotions and feelings and intense interference in the lives of those involved. And obviously it is not only those who have excessively delayed their access to parenthood who find themselves “caught out” by infertility, but also older people attempting to set out on new family and life projects. For the majority of those affected, infertility is a traumatic situation and results in a significant psychological crisis, in which they are obliged to acknowledge incapacities in a context closely associated with feelings of worth about oneself, involving ideals and social representations, and in which desired but unattainable “children” are seen as representing an irreparable loss of an aspect of the self.

      "title": "Strength-based Case Management for Children in Institutional Care",
      "abstract": "The family's influence on a child's life is an unquestionable truth. The preamble of the convention on the rights of the child states that ‘… the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding’. No child wants to move away from his/her family. Yet, children have no control over their circumstances and often they are silent victims of violence and abuse towards them and are forced to flee from their homes to accept shelter in institutions. There is a huge body of evidence on the adverse effects of institutional care of children. Many countries have taken initiatives to promote alternatives to institutional care, such as strengthening families, kinship care, foster care and adoption. Children are often traumatised by being abandoned or being physically, emotionally or sexually abused prior to entering the institutional care. There is extensive and growing evidence showing how the experience of abuse and neglect may have a long-term, negative impact on children's physical, cognitive, social, emotional and behavioural development. Child maltreatment in institutions further deteriorates their mental health, increases their vulnerability and reduces their resilience causing complex mental health problems. This article highlights the importance of strength-based case management framework in order to provide therapeutic care addressing the specific issues and needs of each child. A professional social worker who acts as a key worker for each child, with manageable case load, works collaboratively with the child, family and other professionals and support agencies. Assessment of risk factors, protective factors, abilities and possibilities in order to prevent further harm and promote hope, enhance their parenting capacity, mobilise physical as well as social resources etc are some of the major tasks of the case manager. These individualized professional services inculcate a feeling of ‘home away from home’ in children who live in institutions and certainly it is a pathway to de-institutionalisation.",

      "title": "Resolving Relocation Issues Pursuant to the ALI Family Dissolution Principles: Are Children Better Protected?",
      "abstract": "Resolving Relocation Issues Pursuant to the ALI Family Dissolution Principles: Are Children Better Protected?* I. INTRODUCTION In our increasingly mobile society,1 a number of factors may prompt a custodial parent to consider relocating after the divorce is final, including moving to be closer to family or other support persons,2 remarrying,3 fleeing an abusive situation,4 seeking a higherpaying job,5 or pursuing a new career.6 In virtually every case, a cus todial parent's relocation with the child will significantly disrupt the coparenting relationship that the parties have been following postdivorce. Notice of that relocation decision is often viewed by the noncustodial parent as a violation of the parties' coparenting agreement and as a threat to the noncustodial parent's relationship with the child. Objections to the relocation are often viewed by the custodial parent as attempts by the noncustodial parent to assert unwarranted control or to relitigate the custody decision. Tempers tend to flare in such circumstances, and the parties often resort to renewed litigation in the form of a petition to modify custody or a motion to prevent the relocation of the child. A relocation battle can be extremely traumatic for the child who is caught in the middle, particularly where the parties already engaged in a protracted custody fight at the time of the divorce. Yet that is the very type of case in which relocation is likely to trigger a new battle between the parents, with each parent presenting compelling arguments and claiming to be motivated by the child's best interests. Clearly, a protracted relocation dispute is not in the child's best interests. II. BACKGROUND Current law governing relocation decisions varies dramatically from state to state,7 often focusing on parental rights, explicitly or implicitly favoring either the custodial or noncustodial parent,8 at the expense of children's rights.9 States that place the burden on the relocating parent10 focus on the child's need for stability in the current custodial setting where the child is able to have frequent contact with both parents, especially when the non-relocating parent has been actively involved in parenting the child. States that place the burden on the non-relocating parent11 focus on the importance of stability in the relationship between the child and the primary custodial parent, the fact that the relocating parent has previously been determined to be the parent best suited to be the primary custodial parent, and the relocating parent's legitimate need to relocate. Each of these approaches presents a compelling argument both for and against relocating the child. In a perfect world, parents would always love each other and their children and would never divorce. In a less perfect world, following divorce, the parents would continue to put the children's interests first at all times, would coparent amicably, and would continue to live in close proximity and provide for frequent contact between the children and each parent. The world is not so perfect, however, and the reality is that primary custodial parents have differing motives for relocating, including compelling, important, legitimate, whimsical, and even vindictive motives. On the other hand, the non-relocating parent may have the same range of motivations in resisting the relocation. Focusing on parental rights and motivations leads to inconsistent outcomes and increased litigation. Even the scholars writing on the topic tend to take positions that favor12 or disfavor13 relocation. Courts have long recognized that relocation presents difficult issues for which there are not easy solutions.14 This observation is particularly true when the court sees the issue as being determined between the parties before the court, the parents. If, instead, the issue is presented as a determination of what outcome best serves the interests of the child,15 the results become more predictable and consistent, resulting in less litigation. …",

      "title": "AGE CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL ADAPTATION OF PEOPLE WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS",
      "abstract": "The article reveals the main features of adaptation of visually impaired people in the social environment. Special attention is paid to the differences in the forms of social adaptation in different age phases of life depending on the degree of visual impairment and the time of acquisition of these defects. The article singles out two types of disabled people with visual impairments: those born blind and those who are blind, who have peculiarities of adaptation in the surrounding space. It is indicated that there are six age-related phases of adaptation of visually impaired people. In particular, the first phase associated with early age is characterized by the desire to learn to walk, to master the immediate material world, and to establish communicative ties with relatives. The second phase – preschool childhood is associated with the establishment of initial social ties outside of family relationships, in groups of preschoolers, mastering the game. The third phase, which correlates with the school years, is characterized by a desire to acquire knowledge and social experience on a par with sighted children or vice versa, a decrease in activity, withdrawal from the family. The fourth phase (post-school age) is associated with the desire to be self-sufficient and independent in all spheres of life. The fifth is characterized by the desire to create normal conditions for life on the basis of acquired achievements. And finally, the sixth (retirement age) is determined by the desire to preserve the acquired social and material status, communicative ties. Each of these phases is also characterized by the dominant social environment in which disabled people with visual impairments adapt: the first is the family, the second is the family and preschool institution, the third is the family and school, the fourth is the work or educational team, the fourth is the labor team and one's own family, the sixth is the family and public associations. It is noted that the adaptation of a person with visual impairments can be considered as a peculiar process that requires the use of special social and psychological means of overcoming obstacles in social adaptation. The role of psychological-pedagogical and social services in this process is indicated, which should take into account the age phases of the visually impaired and the time of their acquisition of these disorders.",

      "title": "Social Supports in the Lives of Child Welfare-Involved Families",
      "abstract": "The literature on child maltreatment recognizes that parents who are reported to child welfare services often struggle with a number of challenges. These challenges are related to, though not limited to, various psychosocial, mental, or physical health conditions, substance and/or alcohol abuse, domestic violence, economic, and/or legal issues (Andrews, 2013). These parents have multiple needs, such as housing, income, education, health, childcare, and family relationships (Maluccio, 1989). Moreover, parents faced with the removal of a child or an investigation of child abuse and/or neglect experience a variety of feelings that extend from mistrust, apprehension, guilt, and uncertainty to frustration and outrage (Bicknell-Hentges, 1995). This is further exacerbated by the trauma of separation and the feeling of stigma experienced with the child welfare system involvement (Scholte et al., 1999).Parents may not be able to rely on family members for support throughout the various phases of the investigatory and reunification or placement phases. In with limited resources as well as substance abuse problems, the parent may have already stretched extended family resources to the limit (Hirshorn, Van Meter, & Brown, 2000). A study comparing non-neglecting and neglecting mothers found that interactions of neglecting mothers with others were described as distrustful, confrontational, and lacking mutuality (Beeman, 1997). Beeman further characterized maltreating parents as socially isolated due to the lack of frequent interaction with their social network members or fewer resources available.While faced with multiple challenges, these parents have limited support sources due to loneliness and disconnectedness from others and social isolation due to the lack of available and quality relationships (Cameron, 2002). Several studies have linked social isolation with an increased risk of disengaged parenting, maternal depression, and child maltreatment (Garbarino 1976; Gelles & Straus, 1979; Salzinger, Kaplan, & Artemyeff, 1983; Chalk & King, 1998; Reppucci, Woolard, & Fried, 1999). Similarly, loneliness may be a contributing factor limiting parents' capability to offer stable, caring, and attentive care to their children (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 2013). Ortega (2002) has indicated that child welfare-involved report feelings of loneliness, social isolation, and less neighbor, friend, and kin support than their non-maltreating counterparts (pp. 853-854). Rodgers (1998) has linked parental stress and child abuse/neglect to the shortage of social and interactions supports. Oates and Forrest (1985) suggested a relationship between a lack of social supports among child welfareinvolved parents to a hesitation and unwillingness to discuss their difficulties with others. Furthermore, parents with higher degrees of informal social support were less likely to face financial challenges and experience depressive symptoms in comparison to those with lower degrees of support (Lyons, Henly, & Schuerman, 2005). Other research studies have confirmed the positive effects of social support on numerous outcomes, such as children's educational outcomes (Rosenfeld & Richman, 2003), caregiver depression (Lyons et al., 2005), family coping strategies (Jones, 1997; Runtz & Schallow, 1997) and community involvement (Corse, Schmid, & Trickett, 1990; Roditti, 2005).Social support has been defined differently in the literature on in child welfare. According to Sarafino (1994), social support included the comfort, caring, and help that were available to parents, which helped improve self-esteem and reduce vulnerability to stress. Furthermore, Cameron and Vanderwoerd (1997) classified social support into four types: instrumental; educational, informational; emotional; and social integration. Likewise, Hoagwood and colleagues (2010) defined family support as services that helped caregivers (a) clarify their own needs or concerns; (b) reduce their sense of isolation, stress, or self-blame; (c) provide education or information; (d) teach skills; and (e) empower and activate them, so that they can more effectively address the needs of their families (p. …",

      "title": "Commentary: feeding problems: an ecological perspective",
      "abstract": "teractive process that varies across children and is embedded in multiple social levels, extending from the family through cultural factors. The ecological model is based on systems theory, in which changes in any one component of the model affect all other components. Children are conceptualized as active contributors within their primary context-the family. At a broader level, feeding is influenced by the ethnotheories that families hold about feeding and by cultural norms for the timing, type, and amount of food that children should eat (Dettwyler, 1989). From a child’s perspective, feeding requires the integration of multiple systems, including temperament, physical development, and psychosocial development. For example, children are unable to eat solids before they have achieved the oral motor control necessary to move food to the back of their mouths in preparation for swallowing. When solid food is introduced too early, while feeding is still dominated by sucking, food is often pushed forward and out of the mouth, as though the child were rejecting it. Caregivers may misinterpret this action as a signal that the child is rejecting the food or rejecting the caregiver, rather than a sign that the child is not ready for the feeding challenges required of solid foods. If the caregiver responds to the perceived rejection with anger or by intensifying the pressure on the child to eat, mealtime can become stressful and unsuccessful to both the child and the caregiver. Thus, feeding problems may be avoided when clinicians strive to understand caregiver interpretations of their children’s behavior and address their perceptions through anticipatory guidance.

      "abstract": "This study shows that caregiving for a spouse with a chronic disease or disability can be a difficult task in many ways and can have a negative impact (e.g. lack of intimacity, sexual problems) on the quality of the relationship between the couple. With regard to sexual problems, for example, insufficient ways to handle sexual dysfunction of the (male) partner, the avoidance of talking about sexuality, a misleading perception of each other’s sexual needs and jealousy can be experienced as especially burdensome. As a consequence, very often caregivers and care receivers report a lower marital satisfaction compared to the time before the caregiving situation set in. In order to reduce the negative impact caregiving may have on the partnership, changes in everyday life and in the relationship have to be accepted and, adequate coping strategies have to be used or learned, respectively (e.g. improvement of verbal communication skills).&#x0D; Zusammenfassung:&#x0D; Diese Studie zeigt, dass die Pflege eines Partners mit chronischer Erkrankung oder Einschränkung in vielerlei Hinsicht eine schwierige Aufgabe darstellt und negative Auswirkungen – wie einen Mangel an Zärtlichkeit oder sexuelle Probleme – auf die Partnerschaftsqualität haben kann. In Hinblick auf sexuelle Probleme können unzureichende Wege mit sexueller Dysfunktion des (männlichen) Partners umzugehen, das Vermeiden von Gesprächen über Sexualität, eine irreführende Wahrnehmung der gegenseitigen sexuellen Bedürfnisse und Eifersucht als besonders belastend erlebt werden. Als Folge berichten Pflegende und Gepflegte über eine geringere Zufriedenheit mit der Partnerschaft als in der Zeit, bevor die Pflegesituation auftrat. Um die möglichen negativen Auswirkungen einer Pflegesituation auf die Partnerschaft zu verringern, müssen Veränderungen im alltäglichen Leben und in der Partnerschaft besser angenommen und adäquate Bewältigungsstrategien wie z.B. eine Verbesserung der verbalen Kommunikation genutzt bzw. erlernt werden.",

      "title": "Social Selves and Social Others in Adolescent Development",
      "abstract": "The aim of the studies reported in this thesis was to deepen our understanding of how the specific social conditions under which an individual develops influences their psychosocial adjustment. Adolescence is a sensitive window for the development of cognitive and affective functions and schemata, and all but one (Chapter 6) of the presented studies were therefore conducted with 12-15 year-olds. During adolescence, the salience of peer-related social reward undergoes a dramatic increase, and autonomy becomes a high priority in their familial relationships. Adolescents consequently “socially reorient,” from family toward peers. Unlike familial relationships, peer relationships are ‘voluntary’, and therefore conditional. Adolescents must learn to navigate unstated conditions, adjusting their behaviour to differing, and often conflicting, sets of expectations with multiple different individuals across a number of contexts. In turning to peers to replace parents as their primary social supports, adolescents may often find themselves in a parallel struggle to establish autonomy, not (only) from parents but from their friends and peer group. Indeed, the surge in peer-related social reward sensitivity may lead adolescents to perceive risks to their social connections and/or status as far outweighing other considerations. Since identities, like social behaviours, are often shaped by relationships and how we believe our relationship partners perceive us, this supports the developmental task of establishing a flexible, stable and unified identity. Combined with the increased need for context-sensitive social behaviour, this requires adolescents to develop multiple role-related selves. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the Adaptive Calibration Model (ACM), and related scholarship, this thesis will argue that adolescence can be understood as a period in which long-term adaptation to one’s sociocultural context is accomplished in part by canalising a variety of self- consistent, context-sensitive behavioural ‘modes’, which may be represented as facets of the self, and that adolescent-onset internalising disorders can be understood as dysregulation of this system of adaptive identity.",

The mothers were interviewed and asked to describe their relationships with their children, their children's fathers, extended families, friends, and employers. The mothers of malnourished children described more chronically disrupted lives. Their housing conditions and employment records reflected disorganization. They had fewer social contacts except with extended families who supervised excessively. The fathers of their babies were either not present or unsupportive. Relationships were more stereotyped, transient, and focused on material aspects. The mothers narcissistic concerns took precedence over the needs of their children. Nearly all the mothers, including the controls, had suffered severe deprivation in childhood. Some mothers of malnourished children were apathetic and dependent, whereas others were manipulative and evasive. These findings were consistent with those previously described for mothers of children with \"failure-to-thrive\" in affluent countries.",

      "abstract": "The theoretical work carried out following the intensive study of the research conducted so far regarding the consequences of divorce and their impact on children represents a major problem that is spread globally. A significant number of children are affected by exposure to parental conflicts related to aspects of the child's domicile and personal relationship schedule with the non-resident parent, legal and financial considerations, or the emotional refusal of at least one of the parents to accept separation. Studies analyzing the influencing factors on child development demonstrate that the time spent in the family is decisive for the evolution of personality and social integration, the adult model, and family relationships imprint the models of subsequent social development, as well as the individual's social success. Multiple studies, mainly transversal, that explored the perspectives of the subjects, discovered a series of determined factors of the problem, reporting inadequate parental care (insufficient or overprotection), parental inconsistency generated by parental separation, and negative parental attitudes. Patterns of pre- and post-divorce marital status determined varied internalizing disorder outcomes in children who experienced divorce. Parents' neglect and conflict, their growth and development difficulties from their own childhood, sexual and physical abuse, can determine the etiology for the development of borderline personality disorder. The documentation with the existing research generated reflections and the theoretical structuring of this material.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Permissive parenting is one of the original parenting styles introduced by Diana Baumrind in 1966. There are two types of permissive parenting: indulgent and neglectful. All permissive parents exhibit low levels of demandingness (i.e., control, maturity demands, and supervision). Indulgent parents exhibit high levels and neglectful parents exhibit low levels of responsiveness (i.e., affective warmth, acceptance, and involvement). Permissive parents rarely use any disciplinary techniques and often avoid confrontation. Children from permissive homes are likely to have high levels of self‐esteem, creativity, and self‐confidence. However, they are likely to have decreased awareness of the limits of acceptable behavior, diminished personal responsibility, and reduced levels of self‐involvement. Additionally, children of permissive parents have poorer social skills, higher rates of insecurity and impulsivity, lower levels of empathy, and fewer self‐regulation skills. They are also more likely to underachieve in academic settings and are at increased risk for future delinquent/deviant behaviors.",

Yet we know very little about the quality and dynamics of the interpersonal relationships within such households. In this investigation, older adults (N= 192) coresiding with adult children respond to a series of hypothetical questions about how their lives might change if they no longer lived with those children. Results indicate that the majority of parents anticipate no change in most aspects of their lives. Among those who anticipate a change, most indicate that their lives would be worse. Bivariate comparisons identify parent, child, and household characteristics that are associated with more negative expectations; however, in multivariate analyses, the marital status of the parents had the most significant and pervasive influence on the attitudes that were expressed, with unmarried elders more likely to anticipate a negative impact.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The decision to place a relative in a long-term care institution is one of the most difficult processes families can go through. Family members often experience conflicting feelings of stress, shock, anxiety, fear, resistance, and guilt. In addition, many individuals, regardless of the amount of previous nursing home experiences, possess misconceptions about nursing home care (Grove, 1997; Mastrian &amp; Dellasega, 1996; Tickle &amp; Hull, 1995). Even after the family realizes the necessity of nursing home placement, achieving a level of comfort with such a decision and maintaining family relationships is a difficult challenge. Unfortunately, family-centered nursing care in longterm care settings is hindered by multiple barriers, including resistance to institutional change, family members' fear and hesitation, institutional rules and protocols, lack of institutional encouragement of family involvement, insufficient programs and activities addressing the social and emotional needs of the family, and ineffective communication between the staff and families. To remedy these barriers, it is suggested the family advanced practice nurse (APN) view the families as clients and initiate family-centered policies to encourage family involvement in the caregiving experience. Ultimately, this will promote individualized care of elderly adults and encourage family processes within the walls of the nursing home.",

For instance, preschool and primary school age periods are characterized by the formation of ideas about the world of things, the completion of the forms of possible actions with them, as well as awareness of social norms and rules that govern these processes. In addition, during these periods the child is included in the system of multi-level social interaction, which also regulates certain patterns of behavior in relation to private or public property. A particular attention is paid to the problem of the child’s interaction with the world of things, his or her willingness to commit vandal acts, such behavior being conditioned by the specificity of parent-child relationship by the example of primary school age. It is shown that certain types of destructive family upbringing, such as rejection, symbiosis, distancing a child can contribute to a child’s readiness to commit vandal actions on objects of public or private property.",

Second, they form part of social chains of risk that begin with a socially compromised start to life, operate throughout the life course partly via educational and other learning experiences, and lead to adult socioeconomic circumstances which affect disease risk through exposures to causal factors in later life. Causal factors at each life stage include physical hazards and behaviours with known or suspected biological pathways, but may also include stressful life conditions which affect biological resources through psychosocial processes which are only beginning to be understood. Thus evidence from two types of studies are reviewed in this chapter: (1) aetiological studies which have examined how variations in adult disease are related to social factors at different stages of the life course in order to understand biological chains of risk, and; (2) studies of social chains of risk, which have investigated either the extent to which individuals experience continuity in their socioeconomic environment or how they interact with their environment in ways that lead to socially patterned exposures which may damage or protect health capital.",

In a longitudinal paradigm focused on developmental issues, mothers of toddlers and preschoolers reported rules for everyday behaviors and noted the child's level of compliance. Results showed (a) commonalities among mothers in the network of rules being socialized, (b) age-related increases in numbers and kinds of rules, (c) a shift in the structure of rule networks from an early emphasis on safety toward encouraging autonomy and integrating children into the family, and (d) an inherent developmental organization within rule networks.

Recruiting a support network often is a precondition for the success of the previous processes. One of modern society's achievements in the area of domestic violence is the insight that parental violence toward children or men's violence toward women not only is a family's own business but the business of society at large. We believe this to be true of violence toward siblings or parents. Without the involvement of parties outside of the nuclear family it is difficult to deal with such situations successfully and morally.",

      "title": "Resilience in Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Resilience evolves and changes constantly through ongoing experience. It refers to the ability to cope with a mental or emotional crisis or to rapidly return to the pre-crisis state. Resilience is not generally a set of personal characteristics with which one is born; it is an adaptive mechanism that can be learned.  Older adults are more likely to experience low resilience because they are vulnerable to multimorbidity, functional incapacity, and socioeconomic and psychological problems. A high level of social and communal interactions and increased levels of spirituality associate with improved resilience. Resilience allows older adults to accept the damage of aging, while also coping with problems and crises like losing dear, spousal caregiving, or acquiring a disability which leaves them feeling stronger than they might are if they have not encountered those crises. In resilience, failure results in growth. High resilience falls into three characteristics: mental, social, and physical. Mental characteristics include happiness, gratitude, mental health, adaptive coping styles, and optimism. Social characteristics are community involvement, contact with family and friends, a sense of purpose, and strong, positive relationships. Physical characteristics include the ability to remain physically independent and mobile, enjoying good health, and believing that one is aging successfully. The present review aims to throw some light on the role of resilience in older adults and how resilience helps them in adjusting to challenging situations. Older adults should be motivated to participate in different behaviors that help create strength, such as entering asocial communities, creating a family relationship strategy, beginning tension control services, performing fitness, or a new hobby.",

      "title": "Attitudes Toward the Non-Traditional Male Role",
      "abstract": "Attitudes about the non-traditional male role, defined as participation in housework and childcare, and willingness to accept financial assistance from a woman, were investigated. Sex-role identification (determined by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory) and involvement in a serious relationship with a woman were examined as possible factors influencing attitudes about the non­ traditional male role. Two hypotheses were investigated and supported: (1) Hen in a serious relationship have more positive attitudes toward the non-traditional male role than men not in a serious relationship, and (2) For sex-role identification, men have more positive attitudes about the non-traditional male role than men, and androgynous men have more positive attitudes than either or men. Hours spent doing household chores per week and college class were also correlated with attitudes toward the non­ traditional male role. 3 Non-traditional Male Attitudes Toward The Non-traditional Male Role Modern lifestyles have brought about changes in traditional male and female roles. Traditionally, women have been responsible for childcare and most household tasks, while men have been assigned the role of primary breadwinner within a household or family unit. Changes in society, such as increasing employment of women outside the home and more single-parent families, have led to a need for greater behavioral flexibility from men. It may now be necessary for many men to perform traditionally activities. In more extreme situations, traditional roles may be completely reversed, with the woman becoming the primary breadwinner in a family, and the man taking on a househusband or '·Mr. Mom type role. The present study was designed to explore the attitudes of college men toward the non-traditional male role, which is defined in this study as participation in household tasks and childcare, and willingness to accept financial assistance from a woman. In this study, sex­ role identification as determined by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI), and involvement in a serious relationship with a woman, were examined as possible 4 Non-traditional Hale influences on men's attitudes about the non-traditional male role. The Bem Sex-Role Inventory (Bem, 1974) was designed to measure the extent to which a person separates himself, or herself, from characteristics that may be considered more appropriate for the opposite sex. Scores on the BSRI place a person into one of four classifications. Classifications are made according to the extent to which the person endorses and personality characteristics as self-descriptive. The classifications are androgynous (high on both masculinity and femininity), (high on masculinity; low on femininity), (high on femininity; low on masculinity), or undifferentiated (low on both masculinity and femininity). Bem has suggested that a narrowly self­ concept might inhibit behaviors that are stereotyped as feminine, while a narrowly self-concept might inhibit behaviors that are stereotyped as masculine. An androgynous self-concept might permit a person to engage freely in both masculine and feminine behaviors, Russell (1978) determined that fathers' participation in childcare is related to sex-role classification. Russell found that androgynous fathers were significantly more involved in day-to-day care, play 5 Non-traditional Male and other interactions with their children than fathers. When combined, androgynous and fathers were more involved than and undifferentiated fathers. Baruch and Barnett (1981) also observed that fathers' participation in childcare was significantly and negatively related to the fathers' perceptions of themselves as stereotypically masculine. McHale and Huston (1984) found fathers' femininity to be positively correlated with their preferences for being involved in childcare activities. However, this finding is contradicted by the results of Baruch and Barnett (1981), which indicate that fathers' participation was not related to self-perceptions of stereotypically traits. Perhaps androgynous and fathers participate more in childcare because they have more positive attitudes toward the non-traditional male role than fathers. And perhaps androgynous and men will have a positive attitude which extends to include participation in household tasks and willingness to accept financial assistance from a woman, as well as childcare. The present study hypothesized that men would have more positive attitudes toward the non-traditional male role than men, and that androgynous men would have more positive attitudes 6 Non-traditional Male than either or men. Men who are involved in a serious relationship. with a woman have probably given much more thought to male­ female divisions of labor than those who are not in a serious relationship, since a division of responsibilities between a man and woman is much more salient to those men who are in a relationship, especially if they live with the woman. It was hypothesized that men who are in a serious relationship with a woman will have more positive attitudes toward the non-traditional male role than men who are not in a serious relationship, resulting from their experience with the give-and-take that occurs within such a relationship, Two hypotheses were tested in the present study: (1) Men who are involved in a serious relationship with a woman will have more positive attitudes about the non­ traditional male role than those who are not in a serious relationship with a woman. (2) Men classified as on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory will have more positive attitudes toward the non-traditional male role than men classified as masculine, while androgynous men will have more positive attitudes than either or men. Non-traditional Male 7 Other variables examined include number of hours spent performing household chores per week, employment of the man outside the home, employment of the woman outside the home (if a serious relationship exists), living arrangement, experience with childcare, and college class (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate",

No intervention will have an impact if it cannot find a slot in the daily routines of an organization, family, or individual. We followed 102 families with children with disabilities for 15 years, listening to their descriptions of their daily lives. A major theme running through all the stories was accommodation—changes made or intentionally not made to the family's daily routine of activities due, at least in part, to their child with disabilities. Accommodations are usually adaptations to everyday routines, not responses to stress; are responsive to how children impact parents' daily routine, not to children's test scores; are related to parents' differing goals and values; do not fit a single script or model for what is good or bad parenting; and predict family sustainability of daily routines, rather than child outcomes. Accommodations can and do change—so interventions can indeed find their places. The practitioner participates in this \"conversation\" between the social structural constraints and opportunities of families and communities, the beliefs and values of parents, and the valuable contributions of the intervention.",

      "abstract": "Children with separation anxiety disorder (SAD) experience unrealistic fear of being separated from their significant caregivers (mostly parents). The occurrence of pathological separation anxiety is determined by many factors: parental attitudes, their mental and physical health, but also the way of perceiving the environment, traumatic events in the child’s family and life, as well as genetic and individual effects. Pandemic situation and related isolation caused change in the current lifestyle. Both psychological (i.e. the novelty of the social situation, negative information in the mass media, fear of their own live and their loved ones) and daily-life routine disturbances (i.e. the closure of schools and restrictions of contacts with peers, limited contacts with distant family members, remote work of parents) generate difficulties for children and can contribute anxiety among children with SAD. Paradoxically, despite the fact that children and adolescents are at home, the COVID-19 pandemic may intensify SAD, exacerbating factors underlying separation anxiety. It turns out that family social isolation can escalate conflicts. This, in turn, adversely affects relationships between family members and can reduce children’s sense of security. Due to pandemic problematic access to specialized health care, especially personal contact with a psychotherapist, children with SAD suffer from insufficient professional help.",

      "title": "Early De-Institutionalisation and Child Care Priorities for Children without Parental Care",
      "abstract": "Children living in institutional settings are susceptible to deprivation on a number of levels. There are base level needs for food, clothing, shelter and medical attention. Often children face deprivation that begins at this basic level, and often caregivers are so overwhelmed at meeting these basic needs for children that secondary needs such as stimulation to improve their cognition and social development fail to occur. Tragically, achieving stable attachment-based relationships is often overlooked, due to staff changes throughout the day, and staffing shortages on the weekends. Children are also grouped by age and may be in a hospital initially, then placed in a baby house throughout infancy, and later moved to an orphanage when approaching childhood. This constant change in environment and caregivers make it virtually impossible for children to develop stable relationships. The transition from an institution to a family home is often challenging for both the child and the parents. In fact, there are situations when children are waiting so also their parents, but the system is unable to be proactive. Often authorities and agencies do not act expeditiously and ultimately the child suffers who is innocent by all means. Children without parental care are most vulnerable. They are mostly separated from parents or abandoned or relinquished by biological parents due to social reasons. There are thousands of children in >403 adoption agencies and many more children in few thousand homes in the country. Perhaps we are far behind the goal. My paper will highlight about child care priorities for early de-institutionalisation of such children.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The experience of caring for older relatives and friends can be socially isolating. Family and unpaid caregivers (“caregivers”) may encounter barriers to social participation (e.g., caregiving duties) and unmet needs in support. Given limited epidemiological evidence of social isolation (SI) and loneliness in this population in the U.S., we reported the prevalence and correlates of SI and loneliness in the National Study of Caregiving Round 12 (n=2,119). Most were females (62%), non-Hispanic white (69%), and had a high school education (91%). Most cared for a parent/parent-in-law (46%). Caregivers provided an average of 70 hours of care/month. On a 4-item SI scale ranging from 0 (high SI) to 4 (low SI), the mean score was 2.6. About 13% of caregivers were categorized as socially isolated. About 33% reported feeling lonely “some days,” “most days,” or “every day.” Logistic regression showed female caregivers (OR: 0.56[0.37,0.86]) and those with lower education levels (OR[college vs below high school]: 0.14[0.06,0.33]) were less likely to be socially isolated vs not isolated, controlling for other socio-demographic (e.g., age) and caregiving characteristics (e.g., hours). Adjusted ordinal logistic regression further showed SI levels among care recipients were associated with SI levels among caregivers (OR: 1.66[1.38,2.00]). Null associations were found in parallel analyses on loneliness. This study highlights the heterogeneity of SI among caregivers of older adults and the necessity of examining the shared experiences with care recipients. More comprehensive loneliness instruments in public health surveillance may advance the understanding of experiences and impacts of SI and loneliness in caregiving.",

      "title": "Sosialisasi Pola Asuh Efektif dan Harmonis untuk Mencegah Kenakalan Remaja",
      "abstract": "Juvenile delinquency is a social phenomenon that often occurs during the transition from childhood to adulthood. Adolescence is known as a phase of identity discovery that is vulnerable to the influence of various external and internal factors. One of the main factors influencing adolescents' tendency to engage in deviant behavior is the family environment. The family plays a crucial role as the first social environment that provides values, norms, and controls for children's behavioral development. This study aims to determine the extent of family influence, particularly parenting styles, communication quality, and family unity, on the emergence of juvenile delinquency. The research method used is a descriptive qualitative approach with data collection techniques through literature review and in-depth interviews with several adolescents and their parents. Data were analyzed to identify the relationship between parenting styles and family dynamics with adolescent behavior. The results show that families with disharmony, minimal communication, and overly authoritarian or permissive parenting styles have a higher tendency to produce deviant behavior in children. Adolescents from such families are more vulnerable to negative associations, social pressure, and have difficulty controlling their emotions. Conversely, families that implement democratic parenting styles, provide emotional attention, and foster open communication tend to foster more emotionally, socially, and morally stable adolescents. This research confirms that strengthening the family's role is key to preventing juvenile delinquency. This can be achieved through improving the quality of communication between family members, implementing parenting styles that balance control and freedom, and maintaining harmony within the household. In this way, the family can function optimally as the first line of defense in shaping positive adolescent character and behavior, thereby minimizing the risk of delinquency.",

      "abstract": "Una enfermedad cronica como la diabetes es un caso claro en el que se produce la necesidad de adaptarse, no solo por la cantidad de limitaciones que la enfermedad supondra para el nino y su familia sino porque tendran que acomodarse a una nueva situacion y aprender una serie de conductas o formas de proceder que van a ser necesarias para el cuidado de la diabetes. Ademas, el entorno social proximo puede constituir una fuente potencial de apoyo o una barrera para el seguimiento del tratamiento diabetologico. A este panorama hay que sumarle:(1) los padres y ninos desconocen y/o poseen habilidades de cuidado erroneas o pobres, (2) los padres no disponen de competencias y recursos para hacer frente a las conductas de incumplimiento u obstaculizadoras del cuidado proporcionado por ellos, a la vez que no saben como transferir la responsabilidad de las tareas e cuidado, constituyendo todo este conglomerado una pesada carga emocional y, (3) los ninos se enfrentan a situaciones sociales comprometedoras de su autocuidado diabetico. Por ello, el ojetivo principal de nuestra investigacion es contrastar empiricamente la eficacia de una intervencion educativa y psicosocial dirigida a preadolescentes con diabetes tipo 1 y sus padres, cuyos componentes son, en el caso de los ninos, educacion diabetologica y entrenamiento en habilidades sociales y, en el caso de los padres, educacion diabetologica y entrenamiento en manejo de contingencias y control de estres. Los sujetos participantes fueron 49 ninos con diabetes y sus respectivos padres, debiendo cumplir los primeros los siguientes requisitos para su inclusion en el estudio: -edad comprendida entre 9 y 12 anos. -un ano como minimo desde el diagnostico de la diabetes tipo 1. -no presentar sintomas de remision transitoria (luna de miel). -ausencia de complicaciones graves debidas a la diabetes.

      "abstract": "The current study examined the effect of a friend’s presence on toddlers’ behavior in high child-to-staff-ratio daycare settings. Toddlers (N = 38) were video-observed in the presence or absence of a verified friend in two situations that burden staff: morning separation and lunchtime (overall, 152 video observations). Higher levels of positive social engagement, fewer agonistic behaviors toward peers, and fewer occurrences of distress were observed in the friend’s presence. The duration of morning separations decreased by half and toddlers contacted the caregiver less during separations and exhibited more prosocial behaviors. Overall, toddlers demonstrated greater empathic concern when their friend was present. During lunchtime, they also displayed greater concern toward peers other than their friend. Friendship, even at a very young age, can constitute a meaningful emotional resource for soothing and security.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Conceptualization of complicated divorce, as an escalation of systemic dysfuncttoning in a highly disturbed and unbalanced system, acquires attributes of trauma-organized-system, and yields itself for therapeutic interventions. Complicated divorce issues The authors comment on their experience while treating families sent by Court order in divorce custody disputes, with explicit aim of evaluating parental competence. This type of systemic dysfunction is severely affecting communication styles, family rules and norms, whereas parenting is frequently marked by tendency to repeat relational-style experienced in marital, partners' conflicts. Feelings of discontent and resentment are projected onto children, and may take form of disqualifications, rejection, discrimination or else, those feelings stemming out of personal ambition such as favoring children. Parental rivalry worsens these processes, leading to attempts of establishing inappropriate level of control over children (instrumentalisation or favorisation). Therefore, care and protection of children is inadequate and children are emotionally neglected. Discussion and conclusion Many of these highly disturbed families, especially those sent by Court order are engaged in a network of different social, legal and mental health institutions. Intervention plans are thus conceived and specifically tailored to suit individual families, confronting dysfunctional patterns and appealing to enhance parental responsibilities. Overcoming family crisis of complicated divorce where children?s emotional needs are neglected is highly indicated for systemic intervening. The authors discuss their experience in treating such families and offer their questions, dilemmas and recommendations.",

Most people with a dementing illness will be cared for at home by a family member, who may experi ence a variety of physical, emotional, financial, and social burdens associated with the caregiving role. The purpose of this article is to (a) examine the physical and psychological effects of providing care to a family member with a dement ing illness, (b) describe the factors that help determine the nature and magnitude of these effects, and (c) discuss several approaches to caregiver intervention designed to reduce the negative impact of this challenging role. Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, relationship to the patient, culture, race, ethnicity), caregiver resources (e.g., coping, social support, availability of a companion animal), and personal characteristics (e.g., personality, health behaviors) shape the dementia caregiving experience and have implications for interventions designed to prevent or lessen the stress and burden that often accompany the role.

      "title": "Research and practice with families in foster care",
      "abstract": "Research and Practice With Families in Foster Care jill Duerr Berrick Foster care is designed for children who cannot safely remain in their birth parents’ homes, usually for reasons relating to child maltreatment. About half of the 400,000 children living in out~of-home care in the US live with unrelated foster parents (Administration for Children, Youth, and Families [ACYF], 2013); others live with relatives in kinship foster care, some live in group homes, and others live in alternative transitional settings. Foster parents are usually strangers to the children they care for in their homes. They typically care for three foster children at a time, and approximately one-third of foster parents have five or more children liv- ing in the home, including their own birth children (US Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2001). Foster care is considered a temporary situation, where custody of the child is transferred from the birth parent to the state, with the caregiver serving the substitute care needs of the child until the birth parent can change the circumstances that necessitated care. Birth parents may have drug or alcohol addictions that interrupt their parenting abilities, seri- ous mental health or health difficulties, or they may be absent due to temporary incarceration or other reasons. Although birth parents use the services proffered by the state, children remain in the homes of substi- tute caregivers—foster parents—until it is safe for them to return to their family of origin or to secure adoption, often with their foster parent or with another alternative caregiver. As such, there are two family systems engaged in foster care: that of the birth family and the foster family. To better understand the unique circumstances and needs of foster families and birth families, we first provide an overview of the roles and responsibilities of birth parents and caregivers vis-a-vis child wel- fare agencies and the courts; we exclude kinship caregivers and caregiv- ers provided in institutional settings (e.g., group homes). We then offer a profile of foster parents and birth parents to contextualize some of their caregiving challenges, needs, resources, caregiving practices, and home environments. The children in care are also described, because they 54",

      "title": "Economic burden and psychological wellbeing among parents of children with autism and learning disability",
      "abstract": "The word disability is stigmatized be it physical or mental disability. The disabled population along with the caregivers face unfriendly attitude in the society. The types of disability include loco-motor, hearing, speech, visual and mental disability. Many parents and families with a child diagnosed with autism farewell. However, a high level of parents experience stress, anxiety and depression. Autism is based on presence of persistent and pervasive deficits of social communication and interaction, and restricted and repetitive behaviors that interferes with functioning in everyday activities (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Additional stressors not related to child –specific factors, such as financial strain, changes in employment related to having a child with autism and caregiving responsibilities to other family members, can also influence maternal psychological wellbeing (Dardas & Ahmad 2014; Hodgetts et al. 2014). The birth of a child with a learning disability often has a profound effect on the family, requiring one or more family members (usually the parent(s)) to adopt the role of ‘carer’. Traditionally, research on caregiving for children and young people with disabilities has highlighted the stresses or burden’ imposed on parents by the many, and often complex, demands of caregiving (Brannan et al.1997; Egan & Walsh 2001; Hassall et al. 2005; McGilloway et al. 1995; Saloviita et al. 2003; Shearn & Todd 2000). The difficulties of managing the care recipient contribute to objective caregiver strain whilst subjective strain is more strongly related to caregiver characteristics and comprises internalized (e.g. worry, sadness) and externalized subjective strain (e.g. anger or resentment towards the child or the behavior). The aim was to study economic burden and psychological well being among parents with autistic and learning disability children. Parents of children aged between 8 to 12 years were considered for the study. The sample consisted of 30 parents of learning disability and 30 parents of autism. Financial impact scale and psychological well being questionnaire were administered to the parents. A purposive sampling technique was opted for the study. The mean, SD, and “t’ will be computed using appropriate statistical measures. The data will be further analyzed based on the obtained results.",

A review of relevant research suggests that the impact of such involvement is conditional on a range of factors, including (a) the level of need experienced by the mother and child, (b) the mother-grandmother relationship history, (c) the developmental stage and life circumstances of the grandmother, (d) the levels of disagreement between mother and grandmother over child-related issues, and (e) the perceived appropriateness of involvement in cultural and interpersonal terms. Under most circumstances grandmother involvement is not a pre-requisite for grandchild adjustment. Where a genuine need for support exists and the support offered is tailored to meet that need, then grandmother involvement can represent a protective feature of the family environment. However, in situations where no such need exists, or the grandmother-mother relationship history precludes a harmonious relationship, then grandmother involvement can represent a risk factor and have a negative effect on family functioning and child adjustment.",

      "title": "Childhood in Sociodemographic Perspective",
      "abstract": "This article reviews the emerging sociodemographic literature on the relationships linking children and their families, by focusing on four topics: (a) the short-term implications for children of parents' family behavior, (b) the short-term implications for parents of the number and ages, or spacing, of their children, (c) the long-term implications of childhood family experiences for subsequent adult behavior, and (d) the probable family circumstances of children in the future. Studies of how parents influence children found (a) that increases in illegitimate fertility and divorce led to a large rise in the proportion of children living in one-parent families, usually with the mother, and in stepfamilies, (b) that children in families maintained by mothers, but not in stepfamilies, experience numerous social, economic, and psychological disadvantages, (c) that, contrary to the popular stereotype, white children in families maintained by mothers are more likely than black children in such families either to be living with or to receive financial assistance from extended family members, and (d) declining fertility and birth cohort size may have led to reductions in the welfare of children compared to the welfare of the elderly during the last 20 years. Studies of how children influence parents found that the presence of at least one child probably reduced marital satisfaction; the presence of a small number of children, especially preschool children, deters parental divorce; children reduce remarriage probabilities for young mothers, but increase them for older mothers; and at least the first and second child probably reduce family income and savings. Studies of how childhood experiences affect individuals in adulthood find that divorce of one's parents reduces one's own marriage probabilities and increases one's own divorce probabilities; childhood stepfamilies have little effect on adult circumstances; contrary to the popular stereotype, children without siblings are not disadvantaged compared to other children; an increasing number of siblings leads to reduced educational attainments, and increasing educational mobility among men with small or medium numbers of siblings accounts for the increase observed for all men during this century. Recent projections suggest that 50-75% of the 1980 birth cohort may live in a one-parent family during childhood, with a range of 40-70% for whites and a range of 85-95% for blacks.",

Social relationships describe regular interactions with other people over a certain period and generally include a mental representation of the relationship and the relationship partner. Social relationships cover diverse types, such as those with family members, romantic partners, friends, colleagues, as well as with other unrelated people. In general, most of these relationships change in number, contact frequency, and relationship quality during adulthood and old age. For example, both the number of and contact with friends and other unrelated people generally decrease with advancing age, whereas the number of and contact with family members remain rather stable. Relatively little is known about longitudinal changes in the quality of relationships, apart from romantic relationships, because few longitudinal studies have tracked specific relationships. Some explanatory factors, which are discussed in the literature, are (a) motivational changes, (b) reduced time due to work and family demands during adulthood, and (c) resource constraints in older age. Future work on social relationships would benefit from increasingly applying dyadic and network approaches to include the perspective of relationship partners as well as from examining online and offline contact in social relationships, which has already proved important among younger adults.",

Parents in families with stepsibling subsystems felt closer to their biological children than parents who did not have stepchildren. They also felt stepchildren negatively affected their relationship with their biological children. When stepsibling subsystems are present, parents more often discipline only their biological children. When stepsibling subsystems are not present the stepparent is more likely to be perceived as playing a parental role, including disciplining the stepchildren. In general, adults in stepfamilies have more difficulty than do children coping with stepsibling subsystems. In the absence of stepsibling subsystems, the tendency is to incorporate the nuclear family model.",

Socio-sexual behaviors were regularly directed toward infants by all group members, including other infants. It is suggested that infant socio-sexuality should be viewed not only as a developmental phenomenon, but as an important factor in group interaction patterns. 4. Group play centered around the oldest male infant and two mothers played more with other infants than with their own infants. 5. Patterns of interaction among group members were shown to be heavily dependent on age-sex status. 6. Young infants initially tried to behave toward one another much as they behaved toward their own mothers. The way in which this tendency produced entirely new behavior patterns is discussed.",

Non-experimental research using a cross-sectional approach with a descriptive research type, the population of family caregivers living with the elderly was 76 people who corresponding the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of family caregivers used positive coping mechanism strategies (planful, self-controlling, seeking-social, accepting, and positive reappraisal) and sometimes or rarely used negative coping mechanism strategies (confronting, distancing, and escape avoidance).

      "abstract": "Characteristics of children's social interaction with younger, older, and same-age peers are explored in this review in an attempt to discover those behaviours that are more likely than others to occur in different relative-age partnerships. It is hypothesized that symmetric behaviour functions (e.g., friendship) are most commonly seen in the interaction of children of similar ages, whilst asymmetric functions (e.g., leadership) are most frequent in interactions between individuals of different ages. It is, indeed, apparent that friendships most commonly occur between individuals of similar ages. Aggression occurs primarily with age-mates, but is also frequently directed toward younger peers. Some types of prosocial behaviour (e.g., nurturance, prosocial dominance, helping) are more frequently displayed with younger peers than with age-mates, while behaviours associated with fairness and morality may be more prevalent in the interaction of age-mates. Instruction and leadership behaviours are most frequently displayed by older children interacting with younger peers. The interactions of children who differ in developmental status thus differ from those between age-mates, and may have different implications for child socialization.",

      "abstract": "The result of this research proved that origin of mother’s position and role is very closed to the child and nephew/niece because the cultural concept based on equality of status among human being makes the harmony of life between man and woman. Because of the position of sumondonese is not as high as one in community of Patriarkhi to encourage obtaining child (quality of self competence of knowledge and science) by wandering. The social change of mother’s position and role is likely caused by 2 reasons; Different view of phenomenon that nature must change, time must rotate and experience is a teacher. Change of father’s position as sumondonese (the honor guest) becomes a father in family of Batih. The improvement of education and social status of nephew/niece, some mothers feel reluctant to guide the nephew/niece. Less intensity of relation is caused by far distance of residence, meanwhile the economic condition is very limited, caused by mother’s various activities as well. Change of relative member’s behavior is caused by lack of attention and care or mother may be sel. sh, therefore the faithfulness of nephew/niece decreases.",

      "abstract": "Groups of mother-preterm (N=26) and mother-full-term (N=34) infant pairs were followed longitudinally from 1 to 24 months corrected age. Measures of maternal attitudes, psychosocial factors, and family demographics were collected at 1, 8, and 18 months, mother-infant behavioral interactions were observed at 4, 8, 12, and 24 months, and infant developmental assessments were conducted at 4, 12, and 24 months. At 24 months, mothers' perception of their family systems was assessed. Results indicated that groups of mother-preterm and mother-full-term infants did not differ in perception of family style or in behavioral interactions at age 2. Correlations between family style and mother-infant behavior at age 2, however, indicated that family style was related significantly more often to measures of mother preterm interaction than mother-full-term interaction. Early maternal attitudes, psychosocialfactors (e.g., social support), and behavioral interactions were related to family style at age 2 for both groups, although again relationships were more often found in the preterm groups. The results are discussed within a transactional framework, suggesting the differential importance of family functioning to high-risk infant development and parent-child relationships. The results also suggest that certain social con texts are specifically related to the development of the family system in both risk and nonrisk groups.",

      "abstract": "This review examines later life family support for adults with developmental disabilities from a life course perspective that takes into account social trends and changes in service patterns and in attitudes of families. Key issues addressed include: (1) trends affecting family caregiving, (2) health and social outcomes of life-long caregiving, (3) support needs of families, (4) family support policies and practices, and (5) recommendations for a research and policy agenda. Research examining outcomes of life-long caregiving has shown that most families adapt well to having a family member with disabilities. However, some families are at risk for poorer physical and mental health outcomes. These include cultural minorities and families of adults with behavioral challenges. Caregiving does seem to have a negative impact on maternal employment and family income as mothers often give up or cut back on employment to care for a child with developmental disabilities, who is more likely to continue living in the family home throughout adulthood than other adult children. Federal and state initiatives are addressing issues of family support through both the developmental disabilities and aging service systems.",

In retrospective interviews, parents discussed their experiences before and after placing their child and how they experienced ambiguous loss as they raised a child that was psychologically absent but physically present. Parents faced ambiguities related to the nature and diagnosis of the disability, support services, and placement. A second situation of ambiguous loss was created when the child was placed. Parents experienced two forms of boundary ambiguity (role and membership ambiguity) and ambivalence regarding placement decisions.

We suggest that this sample of patients with affective disorders returned to religious commitment after adolescence. A possibly related finding is a higher rate of intact marriage and lower rates of separation and divorce among these patients, as well as upward social mobility.",

      "abstract": "The role of the mother in structuring interactions with the infant during free play was examined at 6 and 9 months. Maternal scaffolding of turn-taking exchanges was then contrasted to the forms of turn-taking apparent in sibling-infant and peer-infant observations. Infants spent more time in turn-taking exchanges with their mothers than with their siblings or peers. These exchanges most often took the form of mothers creating sequences by responding to infants' social and nonsocial acts and by eliciting social and nonsocial responses from the infants. Infants' exchanges with older siblings were briefer and more typically involved the older children eliciting nonsocial responses from the infants but not responding contingently to the infants' interests and actions. Infant peers spent less time in turn-taking exchanges, and their interactions showed less evidence of scaffolding. At the same time, the proportion of strictly social interactions was greatest with peers. Relations were apparent between infants' turn-taking experiences with their mothers and the infants' subsequent interactions with their siblings and with their peers. Relations were also found between infants' interaction experiences with their older siblings and subsequent peer interaction. Those infants with more extensive turn-taking experience with more skilled social partners were subsequently observed to engage in more extensive turn-taking interactions with a peer. These results are discussed in terms of studies on mother-infant attachment and peer competence, maternal scaffolding, and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract I) Relationships between captive adult female rhesus monkeys were assessed for 6 weeks before and 20 weeks after birth in terms of proximity, approaches and leavings, grooming and agonistic interactions. 2) Before the births, the mothers-to-be spent more time with (and more time grooming with) related than with unrelated individuals. Responsibility for proximity with unrelated adult females to whom the mother was dominant lay primarily with the mother, but where the other female was subordinate it might lie with either party. Mothers-to-be tended to groom adult females dominant to themselves more than they were groomed by them, and vice versa. 3) Differences between the times that mothers-to-be spent near members of different age/sex/rank classes could not be accounted for in terms of generalizations describing preferences of the mothers for members of those classes nor relative preferences of them for her. 4) After the births, members of all age/sex/rank classes tended to be near (and to groom) mothers more when the infants were on the mothers than when they were off but near her, and to be near the mother more when the infants were off but near than when the infants were off and distant from the mother. Proximity between mother and others tended to become more independent of the position of the baby as it developed. 5) Differences between age/sex/rank classes in time spent near the mother after birth were generally similar to those found before birth. The index for the mother's role in maintaining proximity was predominantly negative. 6) All age/sex/rank categories tended to be near the mother less after the birth than before, especially when the infant was off its mother. The differences disappeared with time. Adult males tended to groom the mother less, and adult females to groom her more, than before birth. 7) Changes in proximity between mother and other from before to after birth can be understood in terms of an increase in the attraction of others to mother and a decrease in mothers' affinity for others.",

      "title": "GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN PSYCHOSES OF CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "1. The predominance of unfavorable hereditary tendencies in the parents of the psychotic children was emphasized by the fact that there was a large number of abnormal siblings in this group. 2. A most striking revelation was the total lack of security in the human relationships to which the psychotic children were subjected. It is appalling to note the disturbed home life, the beatings and the brutal treatment these children received, and the hatred many of them bore toward their parents. There were many abnormal attachments to parents or parent substitutes, which kept the children immature, repressed, dependent and insecure in their social relationships. The perfectionist parents set up standards too high for their children to attain, and here we found the children in conflict because of feelings of guilt and inadequacy. 3. The insecurity of the psychotic group was further evidenced by the large number of destitute homes, inferior neighborhoods, and placements in focter homes and institutions. Low economic status prevented the children from having even the necessities of life and opportunities productive of normal development. The burden that the families of the psychotic children imposed on the community was emphasized by the fact that 45 of them had 326 registrations with social agencies, an average of 7 per family. This was in marked contrast to the control group in which 14 families had 16 registrations chiefly for assistance during the years of depression. 4. In the matter of health, we found that adverse prenatal factors were outstanding in the psychotic group, whereas the number of instrumental and difficult births were about equal in both groups. No doubt, the higher economic and social standards in the control group made better medical and surgical care available to these children at the time of birth and throughout childhood. This advantage may also account for the less damaging effects of the serious illnesses that occurred in rather large numbers in the control group. 5. The conflicts seen in the psychotic children centered around their violent personal relationships and sex experiences. The conflicts in the control group were chiefly concerned with school difficulties and social striving. 6. Psychic traumas contributed significantly to the mental breakdown of a large number of psychotic children. Ten of them had been shocked by the deaths of parents to whom they had retained infantile attachments. Four children were so disoriented upon learning of their adoption that they could not reconcile themselves to the true situation. Four children had lived with mentally ill mothers who were finally hospitalized. Sex traumas were reported in 14 cases of children who were overwhelmed with guilt and fear regarding masturbation. Four boys had been seduced and exploited by homosexuals. Three children were horrified by incest in the home, and 3 girls had become pregnant. Five girls were obsessed with imaginary pregnancy, having had no sex instruction except from their associates. Six children had been tormented, beaten, tied and confined by their companions so that they were terrified in the company of children, and felt safe only with adults. Two children of the control group had had similar experiences but the situations had been handled wisely. 7. The children in the control group by contrast had for the most part led happy, active and well-organized lives. In addition to school work and related activities, there were many club and other social affiliations. Most of the children had hobbies, and a number were on the editorial staffs of their school papers. Twenty boys and 14 girls were earning money outside the home. Sixteen boys were about to enter the military service, and 7 girls were helping in war activities. A large number of the children had church affiliations, and a number were active in church work. The few shy and unsocial children were gaining satisfaction by being on the honor rolls, by developing musical and artistic abilities, and by devotion to family In conclusion, it can be said without qualification that children have the right to expect of their homes and of society the same privileges that we, as adults, demand in our lives; namely, security, justice, love and opportunity. We can readily appreciate that the psychotic children have been tragically defrauded, while the children in the control group have had their share of privileges. It is, therefore, the responsibility of all persons engaged in mental health work to see to it that children are given their rightful opportunities so that we may look forward to a reduction in the number of cases presenting symptoms of mental and nervous disorders.",

Maternal sensitivity within joint attention was rated on two measures: following infants’ interests and scaffolding infants’ activities. Infants’ play was more advanced with mother than when alone. With mother, infants had more functional and appropriate relational play within joint attention and more stereotypical play outside joint attention, indicating more advanced play within joint attention and more immature play outside joint attention. Functional play within joint attention, but not outside joint attention, correlated with functional play when alone. Mothers’ ability to scaffold infants’ activities within joint attention may be particularly facilitative to infants’ advanced play.",

This current study explores the motivations of South Asian Indian immigrant parents for sending their young children to India to live temporarily with their grandparents. This qualitative study involves in-depth interviews with first generation immigrant parents about their experiences and motivations for sending their children to India. Analysis of the data revealed five themes, namely, (a) contextual and daily challenges in caring for their children in the United States, (b) parents’ concern around paid group childcare, (c) grandparents as ideal caregivers but unable to stay in the United States, (d) presence of other extended network of relationships and support in India and (e) parents wanting their children to maintain their language and customs. Findings suggest culturally grounded beliefs around optimal childrearing (e.g., grandparents as ideal caregivers, presence of extended network of support in India and maintaining Indian traditions and values) and parents’ contextual needs (e.g., parents’ busy schedule around job and education) when traditional caregiving context changes due to migration to a new country.

      "title": "The ecosystem approach in health social work",
      "abstract": "Introduction Health is the greatest value in our lives. Analyzing the current approaches of the WHO (2014), we consider this concept not only from the standpoint of physical health and the absence of disease, but understand this phenomenon as a holistic state of complete well-being, which includes, in addition to physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual, sexual, environmental and many other aspects. This is the so-called holistic model of health (Orzhekhovska, 2013). Our reasoning suggests (given various aspects of health) that this value does not depend only on an individual's choice to be or not to be healthy, and cannot be governed solely by personal actions. Here are some examples. The lack of geographically close medical services and / or free medical services causes the inability to receive emergency medical care and / or to systematically monitor health. Negative relationships in the family, the absence of a father or mother in the family can lead to emotional rejection of the child (psycho-emotional disorders), the acquisition of undesirable behavior (child addictive behavior or delinquent behavior), lack of self-care skills (this can cause various infectious diseases), getting into institutional care, which usually do not contribute to the full development of personality, etc. Inadequate social policies and an imperfect health care system in the country can cause outbreaks of socially dangerous diseases and provoke the spread of pandemics. Aggressive urbanization creates uncomfortable living conditions in cities due to traffic jams, pollution, noise, which causes other health risks from stress to cancer. As we can see, good health depends not only on the individual being healthy in the broad context of this word, but on the complex impact on us of a number of systems in which we are included. It is important to emphasize the role of social work in this context, the theory and practice of which aim, inter alia, to promote social development and well-being, as well as to improve the health care system and reduce social inequalities. Therefore, the task of social work in general and social workers together with other professionals in particular is to support the individual, family, community, society in the context of strengthening and maintaining the health of both individual and public. An ecosystem approach in social work helps us to understand the process of maintaining and strengthening health, which explains well the mutual influence of each element of the system. Purpose The aim of the article was to consider health social work according to ecosystem approach. Methodology The study used theoretical methods of research, in particular, analysis, comparison, synthesis and implementation of the results of the study of health social work based on the principles of integral ecology and ecosystem approach. Results and Discussion The ecosystem approach is used in various spheres of practical and scientific activity: public health, ecology, economy, legal and social spheres, church-religious sphere and even education (Forget, Lebel, 2001; Deinega, 2018; Veklych, 2017; Voronkin, 2017). Kabanenko and T. Semigina (2004) write about the separation of the ecological approach in social work on the basis of systems theory (sociological group of social work theories). Within this approach, the authors consider the main models of work and tools that can be used by social workers in their practice: eco-maps, genograms, etc. Systems theory and environmental theory are mentioned in the manual \"Introduction to Practical Social Work\". In systems theory, \"a whole is greater than the sum of its parts\", so it is important to consider \"the interaction of the client and the environment.\" Ecological theory considers a person in the context of his or her entourage, but not only the family, society, but also the environment (Klos, Mykytenko, 2005, 52-54). In contrast to the mentioned researchers, T. Syla (2012) explores the problem of violence in the context of the ecosystem approach, she notes that this approach originates from the socio-ecological theory of Bronfenbrenner in psychology. So, no matter what theories the ecosystem approach is based on, the idea behind this concept is a wide range of interconnections. Every smaller object, such as a person, is part of a large range of interactions of larger systems: family, community, society, environment, and so on. Each element of the system affects the other, so solving a problem situation in one area can be an impetus for positive change in another. Chaikovska and O. Hlavatska talk about the need to train social workers with a \"high level of environmental culture\" (2019). In scientific works on social work we find the concepts \"ecosystem approach\" and \"ecological approach\", which are virtually identical in content. This perspective has formed over time one of the modern concepts of social work: \"environmental social work\", or \"eco-social work\", or \"green social work\". The latter in her current research is much covered by T. Semigina (2018). The researcher notes that \"a healthy environment is seen as an inalienable human right, a component of human dignity and non-discrimination.\" However, today there is no research on health social work from the standpoint of an ecosystem approach. The ecosystem approach resonates with another very important concept. It is an integrated ecology. This concept appeared in the church-religious sphere, and was covered in the Encyclical (papal document) \"Laudato si\" by the head of the Catholic Church Pope Francis (2015/2019). According to the vision of Francis, there can be no question of ensuring the common good, guaranteeing fundamental rights, social justice, if humanity understands nature as something separate and does not link environmental pollution with economic activity, behavior, etc. Conclusion Therefore, it is obvious that today, in the conditions of social transformations and globalization processes, the solution of any social problem should be considered from the standpoint of the ecosystem approach. Health issues in social work cannot be considered without taking into account changes in the environment. For such activities, it is necessary to train social workers in the context of the ecosystem approach, programs and projects should be developed to help overcome the problems of clients' health in a comprehensive way. Further research is needed to study existing and develop new forms and models of social work on the basis of strengthening and maintaining the health of clients, taking into account the ecosystem approach and the basics of integral ecology",

In the past, the development of recreation skills among children has occurred most often in either self-contained schools or residential environments. Many of these programs have focused on a limited set of activities such as bowling, swimming, arts and crafts, and field trips (Schleien & Werder, 1985); have been offered for only one to two weeks (often during summer vacation); and, when available in community settings, often require that children with disabilities be segregated from those who are not disabled, When interactions with nondisabled children in integrated programs do occur, participation is characterized by strictly hierarchical, vertical role relationships. Often in these relationships, the nondisabled child is the helper and the participant with disabilities is the recipient of help.",

      "title": "Positive Mental Health through Life Skill Education: Empowering Adolescents Having Psychosocial Problems",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONAdolescent stage of human life span development is most sensitive and complex in regard with the different bio-psychosocial changes. The high risk behavior, experimentation and early adaptation of adulthood characteristics leads this groups to problematic in adjusting to themselves and with society. The complexities include the behavioral problems, delinquency, lack of interest in studies, suicidal orientation, adolescence pregnancy, high risk sexual behavior and substance abuse. This is a period of diversion and curiosity to have experiment with the above aspects. The changing patterns and structure of social life, especially transition of family system from traditional to nuclear, reduced social interaction and technological outburst are some of the many reasons that makes the scenario more complex in regard with problematic trajectory behavior of this segment. The trend in child rearing and adolescent's behavior shows significant changes and it's having a correlation with the changes in traditional system of family support and socialization. The institutional, non institutional, informal and formal supports are most essential for the positive growth and development of the adolescents but most of the time such formal and informal supports are lacking in our present system of parenting and education. There is an intensive need of inclusiveness in our present educational system for meeting the challenges and developing the opportunities in adolescence period. Adolescence constitutes a vital part of our population and the resources for tomorrow. Adolescents represent one fifth of the global population; healthy, competent adolescents who enter the work force can raise the economic productivity of a country. Economists stress the importance of using this demographic dividend for national development. On the other hand, not investing in the health and development of adolescents contributes to the vicious cycle of illhealth and socioeconomic deprivation (WHO, 2012). They deserve an appropriate position in the process of planning and policy making in the domains of health, education (Sushil Singhal & UNB Rao 2007). In the recent decades the issues in relation with children's and adolescence are in rise especially a country like India having about 30% of adolescence population.Adolescence represents a unique period in the life cycle where they are no longer children and not yet adults. Adolescence represents an opportunity for encouraging healthy choices and pro-social behaviors that will continue into adulthood. By investing in adolescent health today, we invest in the workforce, parents, and leaders of tomorrow (US. DHHS, 2010). There should be systematic mechanisms for addressing the issues of adolescents especially areas like health; education has deserving a high concern. Under health mental health aspects of this category has been marginalized in our present system. Our present system of mental health in regard with adolescence problem, limited in the boarders of anti suicide and anti drug abuse campaigns. The developmental or positive and integrated approach to their developmental aspects never addressed. In the present scenario we are very advanced in dealing with the mental illness but interventions through Psychiatry, Psychology, Psychotherapy and Social Work have done very poorly with the mental health, especially the preventive aspects. As it a non communicable health issue, prevention in mental health didn't get a space in the mainstream health programmes. Positive mental health approach is not merely the prevention of mental illness but it should be directed to ensure the overall well being and better social functioning. Life skill education is widely accepted as a tool of intervention in enhancing skill and capabilities to cope up with the daily demands of life, especially among a unique segment like adolescents. It addresses and enables them to equip with skills to face the challenges of life. …",

      "abstract": "Familial adaptation to pubertal change in males—the Steinberg effort was longitudinal—may be characterized as involving a period of temporarily increased conflict between mother and son at the peak of pubertal change. Relations between pubertal status and the rearing and outcome measures were assessed with multiple regression analyses. Pubertal status was treated as a continuous variable and was entered into the regression equation as a set of power polynomial terms (i.e., the terms were entered separately and hierarchically). Parent–adolescent relations, compared to parent-child relations, apparently are less mutually supportive, less often show positive unconditional regard, and there is less nurturance. These may well be sequelae of the chronic deployment of avoidance as a means of conflict resolution. Pubertal changes could produce behavioral changes in the adolescent that, in turn, produce behavioral changes in the parents. Or, the impact of pubertal change on parental behaviors could be more direct and changes in parental behaviors could then produce changes in adolescent behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The family situation of the young addict and the young person who has attempted suicide features anomalous relatives rather than psychiatric pathology as such. These relatives condition disturbed interpersonal relations within the family and these are responsible for the abnormal behavior of the patients. In both groups under examination, the family nucleus proved to be disturbed. Rather than the external structure of the family, the decisive factor was the communication between the various members, namely family cohesion proved to be only partial or actually inexistent in about 70% of cases. A substantial difference between the two groups was the father's affective behaviour towards his wife; the addict's father showed a prevalence of a parasitic attitude, while the mother was more hyper-protective with a tendency to establish a relationship of ambiguous dependence with the child, the young person finding it hard to release himself from this.",

      "abstract": "Home is the experience of a dynamic relationship between the individual and the environment. It can be viewed as a lived experience that possesses deep existential meaning for the individual. Homelessness is the experience of the negation of home; the relationship between the individual and the environment loses its intimacy and becomes severely damaged. This painful experience brings about deep existential despair. The data supports the strong probability that the institutionalized elderly are homeless and that the elder's attempts to cope with this unendurable pain results in behaviors that are often misinterpreted as indicating acceptance or adjustment to the nursing home setting. Nursing must recognize the possibility that to be institutionalized is to be homeless. This intolerable state must be alleviated either through significant modification of nursing home psychosocial environments or the identification of alternative settings for the care of chronically ill and debilitated elderly persons.",

El segundo grupo pertenecia a un nivel socioeconomico mas bajo y con menor escolaridad y el tercero, al mas alto en ambos aspectos. Seguir viviendo con los padres no tenia el mismo significado que en los paises del norte de America y del norte y centro de Europa.

The second group had the lowest socioeconomic and educational level and the third one had the highest in both respects. Living at home in emerging adulthood had a different psychological meaning in Argentina than in Northern American or Northern and central Europe. The residential status was associated with different levels of internalizing and externalizing problems neither in adolescence nor in emerging adulthood, with the sole exception of higher binge drinking episodes at age 23 and higher depression and anxiety throughout adolescence in those living by themselves. No differences were found in emerging adulthood in the quality of their relationship with mother and father (level of conflict and perceived support). In adolescence, unlike other-countries findings, those still in the nest had not enjoyed a warmer relationship with their parents neither had those who left home endured higher parental violence against the child.

      "abstract": "abstract Poverty is a powerful factor that can alter lifetime developmental trajectories in cognitive, socioemotional, and physical health outcomes. Most explanatory work on the underlying psychological processes of how poverty affects development has focused on parental investment and parenting practices, principally responsiveness. Our primary objective in this article was to describe a third, complementary pathway—chronic stress and coping—that may also prove helpful in understanding the developmental impacts of early childhood poverty throughout life. Disadvantaged children are more likely than their wealthier peers to confront a wide array of physical stressors (e.g., substandard housing, chaotic environments) and psychosocial stressors (e.g., family turmoil, separation from adult caregivers). As exposure to stressors accumulates, physiological response systems that are designed to handle relatively infrequent, acute environmental demands are overwhelmed. Chronic cumulative stressors also disrupt the self‐regulatory processes that help children cope with external demands.",

This qualitative study investigates the relationship between experiencing school bullying and social attachment patterns in early adulthood. The analysis comprises a retrospective study of young adults in Poland (n = 20) who were interviewed to investigate possible connections between their peer bullying experiences and current social lives. The findings reveal three major social attachment patterns in adulthood: social cushioning, anxious withdrawal, and desperate friendship-seeking. In the first pattern, a person acquires emotional and social security through attachment to a small peer circle. In the second, a young adult prefers solitude or limited social contact to avoid further negative experiences. In the third, a person seeks to be socially recovered and approved despite multiple failures and rejections.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the development of prosocial behaviors between siblings in a naturalistic setting over a period of two years. This study examined (1) behavioral cues indicating siblings’ needs, (2) responses to siblings’ manifestations of need, and (3) engagement or failure to engage in prosocial behaviors. A total of 40 families with two children were observed in their homes at two time points; when they were 2- and 4-years and then 4- and 6-years of age. Siblings’ interactions were coded for 180 minutes at each time point. Overall, children often failed to express their needs explicitly and consequently, parents intervened frequently to clarify children’s ambiguous manifestations of need, although the children’s helping behavior did not depend on parental intervention. Children’s expressions of need changed over time and varied between siblings. Moreover, some behavioral cues such as nonverbal request and negative emotionality appeared to be more persuasive to siblings, as they elicited prosociality more than other cues. As children got older, they more often addressed implicit cues. Children engaged in helping and sharing more than comforting and protecting, and the theorized association between types of behavioral cues and children’s engagement in different forms of prosocial behavior was found. Children’s engagement in sharing was found to depend on its cost, as well as the ownership status of the contested resource. Overall, the findings illuminate how prosociality develops between siblings. Implications for parents and educators are discussed in terms of possible ways in which this development might be facilitated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Siblings of disabled or chronically ill children are often hidden family members and their needs for support might not be met. Current research however is limited in its understanding of siblings' lived experiences. This study uses semi‐structured interviews to explore the lived experiences of 16 individuals (referred to as siblings) who grew up with a disabled or chronically ill brother or sister. Participants reflected on their childhood and adolescent experiences as siblings, focusing on their social interactions and relationships, social support, and wellbeing. Using thematic analysis, we identified four distinct but theoretically related themes; participants experienced (a) feelings of invisibility during social interactions, (b) psychological difficulties due to the internalisation of family roles or life conditions, and (c) feelings of guilt and self‐blame. Finally, (d) social support was central as siblings were sometimes unable to understand their own needs, and support from family and peer groups helped them have their negative experiences validated. Our findings suggest greater support for siblings is required with a focus on addressing negative feelings and the availability of social support from people with similar experiences.",

      "title": "Partnership for combating social exclusion, on the example, the Subcarpathian social cooperative",
      "abstract": "Social exclusion is associated with situations, in which an individual cannot normally participate in the activities of citizens in a given society. It is essential to note that such a restriction is not due to internal beliefs, but is beyond the control of that person. Societal exclusion is a multidimensional phenomenon, meaning, that a person cannot participate in political, economic and cultural life as a result of a lack of access to resources, goods and institutions, as well as restrictions of social rights or a deprivation of needs. The groups or social categories in which individuals are most vulnerable to exclusion are: the disabled, the mentally ill, addicts, the long-term unemployed, individuals with low professional skills, those released from correctional facilities, single mothers raising children, victims from pathological families, children and youth from neglected environments or raised outside of the family, the elderly, the homeless, immigrants, and members of ethnic minorities. The cause or effect of social exclusion is poverty. A combination of several of these noted problems increases the risk of experiencing exclusion. In the field of social assistance, the problems which an individual and their family experience are the stimuli or task for action to be taken. J. Wygnański stated that, with respect to clients, they are: (…) often those for which the existing instruments of social assistance or labour offices do not work. For many, it is not assistance, just control, and they do everything to dodge it. Some have limited their aspirations to the level of their existence, i.e. the necessity to earn money to purchase the cheapest alcohol. Can you reach such people with the tale of the fishing rod and fish? They are fixated on fish, not even salmon, but anything. They do not believe in a chance for independence, but they know how to navigate in the system of assistance offered by the state and non-governmental organizations, to receive something. Hence the need for new ideas for assistance – so that these people will be willing to help themselves. We are not the only one in Europe that has managed to create a welfare system perpetuated on passivity and exclusion, making it impossible for the welfare state to bear (Mateja 2008). The cited formulation indicates that long-term use of benefits generates the formation of a dependency on assistance. Effective social assistance should therefore be orientated towards activating, and cannot be deactivating and overwhelming. In the context of the aforementioned social exclusion, social enterprises which perform different functions have important tasks to fulfill. Social economy or social entrepreneurship are terms referring to social economy, combining both social and economic objectives. Competences mentioned in the catalogue of social enterprise: social integration and activity in the labour market, provision of public services: social (educational, custodial care, in the field of healthcare) and technical (of a reciprocal nature, in the open labour market, the supply of public goods and the development of local communities, and business and production activities) (Co to jest ekonomia społeczna?; Szluz 2010: 257-273). A specific form of social enterprise is a social cooperative which is mainly made up of individuals at risk of social exclusion due to unemployment, a disability or mental illness, or having trouble finding work. Activity and work in social cooperatives gives them a chance of social and professional activation, integration, as well as upgrading their skills. Unlike other social economy entities, the social cooperative requires a high degree of independence and responsibility from its members. A collegial method of decision making applies. Members of the cooperative are entirely responsible for the cooperative’s affairs, and learn independence and long-term planning. They care about the financial aspects, manage their own business, and set the direction of development. The cited issues have become the impetus for undertaking analysis and considerations, whose aim is to demonstrate cooperation for combating social exclusion. The Subcarpathian social cooperatives have become very good examples, which arose as a result of actions taken within the scope of the partnership.",

Metodo: Se utilizo la observacion para identificar senales externas de familiaridad acritica en instituciones de salud de La Habana. Resultados : El padecer familiaridad acritica significa adaptarse a lo que existe sin actuar hacia el cambio, denota una actitud pasiva, de exceso de tolerancia que acoge a la desidia y coloca la responsabilidad en un otro. Expresiones diversas de familiaridad acritica fueron identificadas; algunas son senales de abandono, deterioro de las condiciones fisicas y de la disciplina del entorno laboral, aspectos que le competen principalmente a la administracion, otras se relacionan directamente con el prestador de servicios que se torna indolente y otras al propio usuario que irrespeta la institucion yse comportan con manifestaciones de mala educacion, chabacaneria y exceso de confianza.",

There is a variety of caregiving environments and family contexts in which children can find themselves. This chapter outlines the full spectrum of attachment experiences, from children who are denied the opportunity to develop close relationships with a caregiver to children who enjoy a close and secure relationship with one or more selected caregivers. Most children remain with the same people in the same social setting throughout most of their childhoods. We consider the developmental implications of living in the same social and psychological environment for the first fifteen years or so of life. If the relationships in that environment are disturbed, which is the case when parents quarrel and fight excessively, this can have an adverse effect on the children's development. We also consider the kinds of relationship children experience when one or both of their parents suffer a mental health problem.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The psychodynamic approach to suicide examines the meaning and origins of suicidal behaviour in terms of the vicissitudes of feelings, motives, self-concept, and interpersonal relationships. Negative or poorly differentiated self-concept; maladaptive defensive or attachment style; and isolative, avoidant, or self-critical personality traits appear to be important risk factors for suicidality in youth. Across diverse national contexts, adolescent suicidality is associated with family factors such as parental psychopathology, negative life events, family discord, negative parent–child relationship (including abuse and neglect), and low perceived family support. Further research is needed to understand the intervening variables linking such family factors to suicide, including delineating the relative contributions of shared genetic risk (e.g. for psychopathology or maladaptive traits) versus the negative developmental impact of adverse family environment. The developmental challenges of adolescence increase the vulnerability to suicidal ideation and behaviour. How specific national or cultural contexts mitigate or exacerbate these factors remains an important area for further study.",

Oftentimes, these children grow up \nwithout a sense of control and power over their lives. Instead of enjoying a \nfeeling o f choice, they carry pervasive feelings o f abandonment and rejec­\ntion from biological family members, and a feeling of discontinuity and incon­\nsistency in everyday living. Outside professionals, laws, and regulations control \nthe lives o f foster care children through a court system that determines “what \nis in the best interest o f the child.” Legal authorities and welfare agencies de­\ncide to leave these children with their biological families or to remove them \nfrom their own homes. Once placed in the foster care system, social workers \nand caretakers become surrogate parents who sometimes conflict with the \nnatural families.

      "title": "The ontogeny of play in a highly cooperative monkey, the common marmoset",
      "abstract": "Abstract Play is widespread in mammals. It is mostly observed in juveniles and has been subdivided in three categories, social, locomotor/rotational, and object play. Although there is no strict consensus on its ultimate function, the dominant idea is that through play juveniles acquire social, technical and cognitive skills for their adult life. In certain species, however, adults remain playful especially with immatures. This pattern can be observed in particular when same-age play partners for immatures are lacking and if adults also invest in caretaking. We studied the ontogeny of play in cooperatively breeding common marmoset twins from the age of two to six months. Social play increased with age and was by far the most prevalent category. Play partners varied with age. Before 19 weeks old, immatures played 54% of the time on average with either one of their parents (in a dyad) and 29% on average after 19 weeks old. Thus, despite the constant presence of a twin, adult-immature play remained considerable, with equal contributions by mothers and fathers and no trade-offs with other care-taking behaviours for either of the parents. However, parents avoided playing simultaneously, presumably to avoid periods with no one vigilant. Together these results show that parents are important play partners for marmoset infants, fathers and mothers alike.",

      "title": "SP0041 TACKLING TRANSITION: THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE, AND WHERE WE ARE HEADING",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> The transition from childhood to adulthood is a key life stage. While the time course of the bio-psycho-social development of young people is continuous, many of the health and social care services with which they may be involved have relatively fixed, rigid structures. This can be challenging for young adults: leading to a sense of marginalisation and alienation. Young people with long term health or social care needs and who require on-going support as they exit childhood are often further challenged by the requirement to move from a children\"s service (with which they are familiar) to an adult service: one requiring new relationships and with differing expectations. Evidence supports the view that young people may be lost in the gap between children\"s and adult services, with a negative impact on longer-term health. Good practice in 'transitional\" care (<i>'a multi-faceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychological and educational/vocational needs of adolescents as they move from child to adult-centred care\"</i>, Blum 1993) can improve engagement and result in positive longer-term outcomes. Developmentally appropriate services recognise young people as a distinct group, subject to constantly changing circumstances. This model considers the young person as a whole: addressing their biological, psychological and social development in the broadest terms. Critically, the approach supports the young person to take an active role in the processes with which they are involved. While developmentally appropriate care and 'transition\" are not equivalent, a developmentally appropriate approach to transition has clear benefits: seeing the process as being outcome and skills-based, rather than time-based. Adolescence and early adulthood are times when life-long health behaviours are set in place; good health for young people is a foundation for good health in later life. There is a need to invest in age appropriate health promotion and youth-friendly health services if we are truly committed to improving young people\"s health outcomes and the health of the adult population they will go on to form. There is an opportunity to develop and sustain a generational shift in health literacy and health-related behaviours: a real legacy; and an investment in the future. <h3>Reference:</h3> [1] Farre, A, Wood V, Radley T, et al. 2015.

      "abstract": "Abstract Children who have experienced parental separation have potentially 3 sets of parents whose relationships may impact on them: mother and former partner, mother and stepfather, and father and new partner. Children's accounts of their response to conflict between these different parental dyads were studied, in relation to the quality of their relationships with these parents assessed with child interviews and questionnaires, and to maternal reports of the children's adjustment, in a sample of 159 children growing up in different family settings. Involvement in conflict within 1 parental dyad was chiefly unrelated to such involvement in conflict between the other parental dyads. In contrast, there was evidence for \"spillover\" effects in relationships within families; for instance, high frequencies of conflict between parents were linked to more troubled parent–child relationships. Children were more likely to side with the parent to whom they were biologically related than with stepparents. Involvement in mother–nonresident father conflict and in mother–stepfather conflict were both associated with adjustment problems, independent of the qualities of positivity and conflict in the relationship between child and parent. Implications for views on \"family boundaries\" are considered.",

      "abstract": "Thirty mother-preschooler dyads were studied for 5 consecutive weekdays. In addition to daily maternal reports of job stressors and parent-child interaction, a subsaraple of 13 dyads was videotaped during the parent-child reunion at the end of each workday. Mothers were much more likely to respond to an increase in job stressors by withdrawing than by becoming more irritable. Both mothers and independent observers described mothers as more behaviorally and emotionally withdrawn (e.g., less speaking and fewer expressions of affection) on days when the mothers reported greater workloads or interpersonal stress at work. Job stressors may have their strongest impact on the daily parenting behavior of mothers who generally experience higher levels of emotional distress (depressed or anxious mood) and, in particular, mothers who report more Type A behaviors. Patterns of interaction between family members change from day to day, often in quite significant ways. For example, why is it that on some days a parent is more easily provoked to scold her or his child or is moved to greater compassion? Many theorists maintain that families are best understood within the context of their broader environments or ecologies (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper, 1991; Bronfenbrenner, 1989). This study focused on a parent's employment situation as one important aspect of a family's ecology that may influence day",

      "abstract": "The ability of many older adults to remain at home with care needs is especially dependent on a “primary” family caregiver; other family members are often underutilized or marginalized. Inequitable care arrangements are one consequence of poor communication, including perceptual incongruence about what is needed, wanted and possible; and implicit and exclusionary decision making. In a study funded by the Retirement Research Foundation, we developed and tested a family communication and care coordination guide for aging parents and their adult children, designed to address these communication challenges. In a self-guided, highly structured process, family members complete individual tools prior to a family meeting where tools are exchanged, a shared assessment is conducted, and a family care plan is established. Nine families (each including a parent with care needs, one primary filial or spousal caregiver, and at least one secondary filial or spousal caregiver) (n=36) participated in the intervention. Individual interviews, including scales and open-ended questions, were conducted pre-and post-intervention; completed tools and guides were also analyzed. We found that: the process for inclusive and explicit decision making can work; the independent completion of individual tools and their exchange in the family meeting facilitated the recognition/reconciliation of perceptual incongruence; and families were able to negotiate a shared assessment and either affirm or make changes in their care arrangement. Finally, when changes were made, they were generally more equitable. The study has implications for applications to different family compositions, to professionals supporting caregiving families, and to further studies of family communication processes.",

      "abstract": "Children are prosocial from a young age onward but their prosocial actions are not necessarily egalitarian – especially with regard to others’ group membership. From around four years of age children tend to help and share more with in-group members compared to out-group members. However, a growing body of findings also suggest that sometimes children act more prosocially toward out-group members. How can we reconcile such seemingly contradicting behaviors? In this chapter, I describe how the salience of group stereotypes might shed light on these inconsistent findings. Specifically, different helping contexts can activate different group stereotypes. These different stereotypes could lead children to sometimes act more prosocially toward in-group peers, but sometimes show out-group bias in their helping or sharing behavior. For example, contexts that involve reciprocity could increase salience of a stereotype that out-groups are less trustworthy and thus children might be less inclined to share their resources with the out-group (i.e., in-group bias). Whereas an academic helping context might make a stereotype salient that entails out-groups are less competent and thus needing more help (i.e., out-group bias). Taking into account group stereotypes in children’s prosocial behavior will provide us with a deeper understanding of the underlying motivations that lead to selective prosociality in children. In the long run, such insights can contribute to combating discrimination and prejudice early in life.",

      "abstract": "Over time, family caregivers for older adults may face care transitions for their loved ones. The move from home to residential care facility is a much-studied transition. Yet we know little of family caregiver experiences when their loved ones move from one facility to another. We interviewed family caregivers of nursing home residents and inquired about caregiver experiences in prior facilities and factors that prompted moving to another facility. Our analysis identified three themes: 1) A precursor of moving to another facility was caregivers’ assessment of poor fit between their family member and the facility; 2) Executing a move was demanding for the caregiver in instrumental and emotional ways; 3) Once in the new facility, caregivers adapted their caregiving to the capacity of the new facility and fostered resident-facility fit (not interfering with good care and supplementing facility care). Findings suggest that family caregivers continually assess and respond to emerging problems with resident-facility fit, which sometimes escalate and necessitate a move to another facility. Nursing home social workers are well-positioned to help families address emerging care problems, so they do not escalate. Doing so can promote care continuity, which benefits both the resident and the family caregiver.",

      "abstract": "Durante la vejez, el aislamiento social se convierte en un desafío significativo debido a los cambios biopsicosociales. La pandemia de COVID-19 exacerbó este problema, especialmente en los adultos mayores institucionalizados. Se utilizó un enfoque cuantitativo descriptivo para evaluar las actividades de ocio y tiempo libre de adultos mayores en un asilo en San José de Cúcuta, Colombia. Se recolectaron datos sociodemográficos y se aplicó un instrumento validado para medir las preferencias de actividades de ocio. La mayoría de los adultos mayores se dedicaron a actividades pasivas, como ver televisión o escuchar música. Se encontraron correlaciones significativas entre la edad y la frecuencia de caminar, así como diferencias en las actividades de ocio según la edad. Las preferencias de ocio parecían independientes del género. El aislamiento social durante la pandemia afectó el bienestar emocional de los adultos mayores.

Las preferencias de actividades de ocio son independientes del género, y se plantea investigar relaciones con el estado civil y la discapacidad.

In a family disorganized by unresolved and recurring internal conflicts the accomplishment of these responsibilities is extremely difficult if not impossible. As the child from a conflict family grows older he may react to the tensions of his family situation by turning too eagerly to a peer group, seeking the satisfactions he fails to experience in his family unit: identity, acceptance, a feeling of belonging, love and affection, even the security of being a member of a consistently structured group with well-defined roles. This inadequately socialized child is ill prepared to distin guish and reject antisocial or delinquent influences and may readily accept all the values, standards, and codes of conduct of the new group, including those that are antisocial and delin quent.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence, a period of psychic reorganization which allows for new adjustments in order to face future life and reorganize the experience of the past, is one of the critical phases of existence. It is described as a \"new birth\", a successful achievement of individuation and separation processes. For the adolescent with an infirmity or chronic illness, and for his family, there exist specific problems in addition to those encountered by a healthy adolescent. The painful realization of social, professional and relational barriers is reactivated. The feeling of failure and helplessness, the impairment of self-esteem, and anger at being the victim of the unfairness of destiny, represent a supplementary affective burden for the adolescent and his family. This results in a risk of deterioration, either towards affective and social withdrawal expressed by overadaptation and weakening of psychic functions, or towards autoaggressive acting-out or various forms of marginalization. Preventive and therapeutic action by the individual and the family are discussed in the light of the case history of an adolescent suffering from a facial malformation.",

      "abstract": "Social support can take many forms, such as practical help, time spent socially with others, or the satisfaction with personal relationships. Social support is known to affect quality of life (QoL) in both non-autistic older and autistic young adults. QoL reflects how satisfied an individual is with their life either overall or in a certain area. We know little about middle-aged and older autistic adults' experiences of social support or QoL. In this study, 388 adults aged 40-83 years old, completed online questionnaires asking about background such as age and sex, depression and anxiety symptoms, QoL (physical, psychological, social, environmental, and autism-specific), and different types of social support. Even after taking into account background, depression, and anxiety, social support was important for individuals' QoL. To our knowledge this is the first paper to examine the relationship between social support and QoL in middle-aged and older autistic adults. Improving social support may have a significant impact on the QoL of older autistic adults. Future studies should examine whether age-related changes in social support (size, content, and arrangement of social networks) that are common in non-autistic aging, also occur among older autistic adults.",

      "abstract": "Ideals or summarized images that influence on the process of self-determination, development of one's own identities are an important element of self-consciousness in adolescence. Comprehension and experience by the individual of his/her sex identity supposes having ideals, etalons of masculine and feminine images, models of masculinity and femininity. Parents and family play a huge role in gender identification of the adolescent. Children deprived of parental care experience double trauma; on the one hand, this is negative experience of family upbringing, on the other the fact of separation from the family. Non-critical perception of similar patterns of behavior in absence of significant examples of a positive system of values in close environment of the child complicates development of appropriate gender identification. For an adolescent brought-up without a family, in the conditions of orphanages, it is impossible to create conditions for identification that fully reproduce family identification. The knowledge about home the child gets and examples of behavior s/he is given are often formal and cannot cause emotional subjective attitude. We attempted to model these images from re-sponders of two age groups: 1) 11-13 y.o. adolescents, 2) 14-15 y.o. teenagers. To reach the aim of the research, we used the method ''Island'' directed at distinguishing the referent group of persons who the children see as ideals, examples for identification. The analysis resulted in the following conclusions: age differentiation of examples, reflection on ideals in the surrounding social life and culture show that consciousness becomes more complex, reaches the level of values, which may be considered as possibilities for adolescents deprived of parental care of conscious self-determination and construction of their own identity. In transition from sense to value consciousness in the social situation of development, the role of referent persons for assessment and identification of gender behavior is reinforced. For adolescents deprived of parental care such persons are representatives of show business, authoritative adults, and friends. Difficulties of development of ideas about gender examples for social orphans are conditioned by their figural consciousness, their narrow cognitive sphere, limited access to the world of culture and social relations, insignificance of gender problems. Girls have more varied, less stereotypic examples of gender identification than boys, which indicates their flexible perception of gender roles. Girls are more oriented at adults as bearers of cultural variants of gender behavior than boys. For many boys authoritative examples of masculinity are friends, which promotes limitedness and stereotypization of their gender behavior. Boys demonstrate reflexive possibilities less than girls. Their ideas about examples of masculinity and femininity are stereotypical and reduced, which may indicate material consciousness, their limited meaning sphere where gender meanings are not significant. Children had difficulties answering questions regarding accepted and refused examples of feminine and masculine behavior, which may be caused by insignificance of gender differentiation in the value space of children and adolescents, by negative experience associated with qualities of masculinity and femininity or its absence in lives of adolescents. It has been identified that space of social relations and culture for identification of gender behavior of social orphans is limited and spontaneous, which indicates a necessity of development of specially organized psychological-pedagogical conditions with account for features of consciousness at the stages of transition from material to sense and from sense to value in development of gender ideas.",

The manner how an individual person ages may contribute to how long a person will live and how fit a person might be in the late period of life. Current policies on ageing may perceive &apos;old age&apos; as a status rather than the result of a process. Some ageing policies may be aimed at providing services within this status rather than at empowering older persons to live independently. Here, a change of paradigm is needed. In order to gain the ability to remain active, the individual needs to invest in this process throughout the life course. Appropriate societal structures, incentives and awareness-raising would enable persons to live an active life-style as long as possible. Current societal and legal infrastructures may not fully provide those opportunities for active ageing.",

Within the setting of family and home, caregivers provide the nurturance, supervision and interactions with the social and physical world that infants and young children require to grow and thrive. Many factors can influence the ability of caregivers to meet these basic needs. The age and maturity of the caregivers, their mental and physical health, level of educational attainment and economic status will shape the environment that children experience. Sometimes, the health or development of the child poses caregiving challenges – for instance, when the child has significant health problems or a compromised birth history (e.g. born at low birth weight) or has a developmental delay or disability. Home visiting programs are designed and implemented to support families in providing an environment that promotes the healthy growth and development of their children. Programs may target their services to families and caregivers who are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to establishing and maintaining such an environment. They may also focus on families in which the child is more vulnerable than the typical child because of health or developmental concerns.",

Actually it is natural that competition arises between siblings. Further attention is needed if there are persistent tensions and conflicts between siblings that are difficult to overcome. For older children or older siblings this is often confusing. Their daily habits are disrupted because previously with mother and father while now the attention of parents turn to younger sibling.

Older siblings will realize that their parents no longer have as much time together as before. Their will realize if the new baby will get a lot of attention from parents. Appears aggressive behavior toward siblings that increases in quantity and intensity, such as pushing, pinching or disturbing their sibling. Another common behavior is that child tends to neglect his daily duties and responsibilities as an excuse to get the attention of his parents. Negative behavior arising from competition between siblings can be reduced by behavior modification using the economic token method.

In contrast to acute grief reactions these pathological syndromes are of long standing. One parent had not truly accepted the death of the child. The denial of reality is sometimes a defence against aggression towards the deceased, because of his having left one behind. The mourning process comes to no end but remains in its initial phase. At the same time the life of the mourner stands still, as in the house and the family everything is left unchanged. Family interactions alter, particularly between the parents. For the genesis of these grief syndromes the following is of relevance: The death occurs at a time, when another child cannot replace the one who died. Mature independence had not been reached by either parent or child. Death destroyed expectations that this child would succeed in that which the parent had been unable to achieve. The parent had not seen the child after death--a gap in the continuity of experiencing which made acceptance of the irreversibility of the loss even more difficult.",

      "title": "The Relationship Between Decision Making, Level of Attachment, Circumstances at Conception and Environment in Healthy Child Development: A Case of Children Growing Up in Kampala and Wakiso Districts",
      "abstract": "Parenting is a responsibility one finds himself or herself under voluntarily or involuntary. During adolescence, gradual changes that may be cognitive, emotional, biological, physical and social or environment occur. The qualities of changes are influenced by how well decisions are made at different levels of interaction (cognition, instinct or biology, emotional, social and/or natural environment) in relation to one’s sexuality. It all begins at conception – through important stages of birth, special care of newborns, weaning, and child in playful stage, socialization and learning, gender roles or interests, young stardom, youthful period and adulthood. The study explored parents’ basis of taking on the responsibilities, quality and level of attachment, parent’s ability and circumstances under which she or he conceived and the parent’s nature of the environment and lifestyle. It went on to find specific relationships between parent’s decision making and quality of attachment, circumstances at conception and attachment, nature of environment and attachment – and environmental, itself, and decision making. Method: The target groups were young parents (18 years to 45 years) subjected to both structured survey questions and focused group discussions (FGD); and children (8 to 18 years) that participated in FGD only. The study had 52 participants of which 33% were from urban areas, 10% (urban) and 58% rural; 40% males and 60% females. SPSS tool was used for data analysis. Appropriate questions were constructed that enabled participants – to freely and honestly speak out from their own experiences. Group focused discussions with equal number of girls and boys (2:2); and adults (women and men) = 3:3 were convened guided by specific themes – regarding gender issues, human rights, risky behaviors and behavior change, relations with parents, knowledge of life goals and problem solving amidst family and environment hazards. Unique cases were also sought of how children from poor backgrounds and as for parenting care managed to succeed late in life. Results: Correlation between decision making and quality of attachment was significant showed by r=0.291, sig. (2-tailed) at 0.036, where p=0.05. Correlation between circumstances faced at conception and quality and level of attachment was not significant when r=0.261, sig. (2-tailed) at 0.061, where p=0.05. Correlation between environment and level and quality of attachment was not significant indicated by r=0.124, sig. (2-tailed) at 0.381, when p=0.05. Correlation between environment and decision making was not significant showed by r=0.148, sig. (2-tailed) at 0.295, when p=0.05. From FDGs, equal treatment between boys and girls was emphasized (4:4) and (6:6) so that they both benefited from development opportunities; of education (both formal and informal) and employment. Friendliness between parents and children was highlighted (4:4) – with correcting behavior attached to light beating, with strongest emphasis put on friendly talking with children (6:6). However, to parents, family planning was still a big challenge – as hardly at all did men approve of it (regarding condom use), while women complained of hemorrhage and delayed resumption of pregnancy as most negative (2:6). Furthermore, condom use was out of every parent’s mind, given the fact that they were married (6:6). 1:6 of parents said that, because her husband did not care about family planning, she adopted inject-plan secretly. 2:6 of women nurtured a norm that alcohol eased delivery and was associated to healthy and pretty babies. In conclusion: Failure of parents to ensure child health growth and development was by and large a result of poverty. This greatly hampered decision making as observed from r=0.291, sig. (2-tailed) at 0.036 where p=0.05. In rural and semi-urban areas it is only mainly men who went to work while women stayed home to cook and bare children. In the same category, the nature of jobs determined by their level of education did not at the same time help meet children development needs as women complained of men’s negligence. There is, thus, a need to start life skills education, poverty alleviation program and reproductive health (or health education) programs to help better family-life situation.",

To be present as a partner and not to find the solutions for the adolescents' conflicts, to accept their questioning of what is established and to recognize their movements of reconciliation are the quite complex demands put on to the world of the adults. Adolescents urge us to a review of our own adolescence, to a balancing of hate and love, openness and rigidity, and to dialectic movements between disintegration and reintegration as well as between the generations. Any help, be it on the physical, the social or the psychic level, should be directed toward a restitution of the intrapsychic, intrafamilial or intergenerational balance; sociocultural factors have also always to be respected.

Few adolescents were involved with fathers at both time points. Relationships with fathers were, in general, less supportive and less problematic over time. Moreover, although father support was not associated with adolescent mothers' psychological adjustment, father absence and father strain had negative associations with psychological adjustment. Maternal grandmother support buffered the negative effects of strain in the adolescents' relationships with biological fathers. Perceptions of less social support from maternal grandmothers and more social support from fathers during the perinatal period as well as less social support from a new male partner at 3 years postpartum predicted relationship continuity between adolescent mothers and fathers at 3 years postpartum. Implications for intervention and policy are discussed.",

Se trata de capturar la modificacion que altera la estabilidad, articulando el cambio por mecanismos que se encuentran en zonas intersticiales entre actor y estructura. Se atiende a procesos interactivos invisibles del sistema procurando: adquisicion de habitos de aprendizaje, nuevas pautas culturales, reordenamiento de grupos de pertenencia y referencia. Es relevante el acompanamiento sistemico para evaluar la capacidad de las adolescentes para establecer conexiones entre categoria social - sentido personal.\r\nPalabras Clave\r\ncambio pautas culturales adolescentes\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nMICROPROCESSES OF CHANGE ON PREGNANTS ADOLESCENTS IN RISK. There are 700.000 new annual births in Argentina: 100.000 are mothers younger than 20 and 3.300 between 10 and 14 years old. This group is the most devoid, with highest economic and social risk. The aim is to generate change by cognitive recategorization, systematic attention and the presence of a trained participant observer. Central hypotheses: a) social self concept and self-esteem improve with change process, b) attention and observer enhance it. Goals: - localize common patterns and differences in the group - intragroupal comparing measurement of self concept and self-esteem - incidence of participant observer Pregnancy and childbirths alter psychosocial development of the adolescent. Creative stability is required to install change. Five phases on groupal / individual sequence will be developed, pointing to control and guide social change, aiming to find laws of that phenomenon. We try to capture the change that alters stability, articulating change by mechanisms placed in interstitial zones between actor and structure. Paying attention to invisible interactive processes of the system, to obtain: learning habits, new cultural patterns, reorganization of belong and reference groups. It becomes relevant a systemic follow-up to evaluate capacity of adolescents to establish connections between social category - personal sense.\r\nKey words\r\nchange cultural patterns recategorization",

      "title": "Families Without Paradigms: Child Poverty and Out-of-Home Placement in Historical Perspective",
      "abstract": "In this Article, Prof. Ross argues that no single paradigm of family relationships adequately serves the emotional needs of children who enter the foster care system due to the poverty of their parents. According to Prof. Ross, the needs of such children are increasingly at issue because of the likely effect on poor families of interactions between the Personal Responsibility Act (PRA) and the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA). Reliable data is not yet available on children who are moved into foster care as their families lose welfare benefits or on those who are placed in adoptive homes in compliance with ASFA’s emphasis on permanency planning.In order to illuminate how these legal changes are likely to affect children, Prof. Ross examines the placing-out programs of the late nineteenth century, which sent indigent urban children to live on farms in western states. Placing out, a precursor of the current foster care system, led to a wide variety of treatment; some children were little more than farm laborers, while others became family members. Participants were unclear about what norms governed the child’s relationships with both the new family and the family of origin, including biological parents, siblings and other relatives. Although the current law provides a clear taxonomy of family types which did not exist a century ago (i.e., biological, foster, and adoptive families) such categories do not always reflect the complexity of human relationships. Prof. Ross argues for a more flexible approach to defining the families created or rearranged by the state, so that these varied families can better serve each child’s needs.",

      "title": "Culture and Peer Relationships",
      "abstract": "Cultural context plays an important role in the development of individual social and behavioral characteristics and peer relationships (e.g., Hinde, 1987). As a result, children in different cultures may engage in different types of social interactions and develop different types of relationships. Moreover, cultural values and beliefs, particularly those pertaining to developmental goals and socialization practices, may affect the function and organization of peer relationships. Specifically, cultural norms and values may serve as a basis for the interpretation of particular behaviors (e.g., aggression, sociability, shyness–inhibition) and for the judgment about the appropriateness of these behaviors. The interpretation and evaluation of social behaviors in turn may have pervasive implications for the processes of peer interactions and the formation of dyadic and group relationships. Finally, the cultural aspects of children's peer experiences are reflected in how they affect developmental pathways and outcomes. For example, the extent to which children's interactions with each other do or do not include responsibility for younger children in a culture (see Gaskins, this volume) may be associated with the later display of nurturance and prosocial behavior.",

      "abstract": "The term “attachment” is used to describe aspects of intense, intimate emotional relationships, with particular emphasis on parent-child interactions and the emotions children feel toward adult caregivers. Attachment is often defined as an emotional tie or a bond between two people, but these terms are metaphors that can cause misunderstanding, because in fact in the relationship partners have differing emotions, thoughts, and behaviors toward each other. Attachment is more accurately considered as an attitude or readiness to behave in certain ways toward one or more specific people. The term as applied to children may refer to attachment behaviors, including the child’s preferring certain familiar people, approaching them when threatened, and using them as secure bases by returning to them while exploring an unfamiliar place, as well as showing intense and lasting distress upon sudden and long-term separation. All these develop between around eight and thirty months of age and are shaped by experiences with consistent, sensitive, socially responsive caregiving. Attachment may also refer to an internal emotional and cognitive state, the internal working model of social relationships, that reflects care experiences and underlies attachment behavior. Attachment behavior and internal working models change with age, but attachment behavior in early life is thought to be a predictor of attitudes and behavior in later relationships.",

      "title": "Parenting and Beyond: Common Neurocircuits Underlying Parental and Altruistic Caregiving",
      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Interpersonal relationships constitute the foundation on which human society is based. The infant–caregiver bond is the earliest and most influential of these relationships. Driven by evolutionary pressure for survival, parents feel compelled to provide care to their biological offspring. However, compassion for non-kin is also ubiquitous in human societies, motivating individuals to suppress their own self-interests to promote the well-being of non-kin members of the society. We argue that the process of early kinship-selective parental care provides the foundation for non-exclusive altruism via the activation of a general Caregiving System that regulates compassion in any of its forms. We propose a tripartite structure of this system that includes (1) the perception of need in another, (2) a caring motivational or feeling state, and (3) the delivery of a helping response to the individual in need. Findings from human and animal research point to specific neurobiological mechanisms including activation of the insula and the secretion of oxytocin that support the adaptive functioning of this Caregiving System.",

      "abstract": "Dietary habits change over the life-course and might be profoundly affected by changes in lifestyle. The transition from living as a dependent in the family home to independent living is a crucial stage in most young people's lives, and the initial diet and lifestyle choices adopted following leaving home may form the basis of dietary habits and health status in adulthood. Many young people leave home to pursue further education, begin employment and/or co-habit/start a family. However, some leave home involuntarily or due to family conflict, becoming homeless. The circumstances of a young person's transition into independent living are likely to have an impact on their health behaviour and dietary habits. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the diet and lifestyles of young people living at home or independently. In particular, the diet and nutritional status of young adults at various stages of independent living (students, homeless and working young adults) was investigated. Phase 1 of the study investigated the differences in diet and health behaviour of young people living independently or in the family home (n=219). Phases 2,3 and 4 investigated the diet and nutritional status of (phase 2) students during their first year of study (n=58), (phase 3) homeless young adults residing temporarily in hostels (n=24) and (phase 4) working young adults who have lived independently for more than 4 years (n=33). The study was based in Liverpool, and volunteers were recruited largely from Merseyside, although the `snowball' recruitment technique resulted in some volunteers from Leicestershire, the Midlands, Surrey and Kent. An age range of 18-30 years was used for this study. This was in order to include both young people who had recently left home (who were likely to be at the lower end of the age range), and those who had lived independently for more than four years (who were likely to be at the higher end of the age range). The dietary habits of working young adults, who had lived independently for more than four years, were closest to recommended nutritional intakes. Students and the homeless generally consumed diets that were high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre. Alcohol intakes were high amongst male and female students and female working adults. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI and skinfolds) were comparable between students and working young adults, but homeless",

Physical factors (the characteristics of housing projects and apartments) and human factors (the behavior and consciousness of mothers) are considered as the residential environment. This study, confirms the following: 1. The behavior and consciousness of mothers are explained by their sociability, protectiveness and frankness. 2. The behavior and consciousness of mothers are influenced by the physical factors such as a housing project type, an apartment style and a floor level. Especially, mothers' protectiveness is much affected by the physical factors. 3. The conditions that tend to hinder infants from going out independently are these: (1) to live in a high-rise, high density housing project type in urban area, (2) to live on higher than the fifth floor, (3) to have a protective mother, (4) to be unable to recognize their housing, (5) to have less outdoor play, (6) to have fewer friends.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study examined adult grandchildren's experience of losing a grandparent in the context of a multigenerational family. Background Although the death of a grandparent in adulthood is often an expected life event, this loss may still result in grief for adult grandchildren. Furthermore, bereavement is not merely an individual experience, but a family one. Characteristics of the relationship between bereaved adult grandchildren and their bereaved middle‐generation parents may influence adult grandchildren's grief responses. This includes both structural (e.g., gender of parent; coresidence with parent) and emotional (e.g., relationship quality; worry about parent) aspects of this tie. Method Young adult grandchildren from Wave 2 of the Family Exchanges Study (2013, N = 204) reported on their recent grandparent loss experiences ( N = 216) and relationships with their middle‐generation parents ( N = 142). Results Three‐level multilevel models revealed that (a) grandsons who lost a grandmother reported significantly fewer grief symptoms than all other gender combinations; (b) worry about a middle‐generation parent was associated with higher grief symptoms, but; (c) this effect was significantly stronger when the middle‐generation parent was a mother, and when adult grandchildren were coresident with that bereaved parent. Finally, relationship quality with the middle‐generation parent was not associated with grief symptoms, irrespective of context. Conclusion Results highlight the intersection of emotional and structural aspects of multigenerational relationships following the death of a family member.",

This study, using the still-face paradigm, demonstrates that even human neonates (n = 90, 3-96 hr after birth) adjust their behavior according to the social responsiveness of their interaction partner. If the interaction partner becomes unresponsive, newborns will also change their behavior, decrease eye contact, and display signs of distress. Even after the interaction partner resumes responsiveness, the effects of the communication disturbance persist as a spillover. These results indicate that even newborn infants sensitively monitor the behavior of others and react as if they had innate expectations regarding rules of interpersonal interaction.",

      "abstract": "People and animals always need to live together with their similars. Between mother and offspring, from the earliest moments of life, an attachment is established, finalized at physiological needs nutrition, and to the affectionate care. Attachment is a primary motivational system development that pushes the child to a specific relationship with his mother; it is activated from real or threatened separation. The most obvious difference between man and animal is the duration of the care and protection that puppies receive from their par ents. Mammals need, for example, to stay close to the mother only for a few months; man remains with the family until adulthood, meeting not only the physiological needs, but also and especially those affective. The quality of parental care, that the child receives in his first years of life, is crucial for his future mental health. It is essential for mental health that the child have expe rience of a stable relationship, intimate and warm with his mother or with other figure of reference. Many psycho-nevroses or character disorders are re sulting from: the deprivation of maternal care, the discontinuity in the moth er-child relationship, early internalization of attachment figures disturbing, or traumatic events such as bereavement or a long separation. When the child is not guided and supported in the moment when they enter into relationships with the surrounding reality, and in this specific context, in the first entry in the world of the school, there is the risk of developing serious damage at the cognitive level, in terms of delays in the acquisition of different skills. When the subject in developmental age has not internalized the healthy relationship, or the awareness to have accessible and available presence of their caregiver, he suffers from separation anxiety often combined with school phobia.

      "title": "Feeding Practices and Parenting: A Pathway to Child Health and Family Happiness",
      "abstract": "Feeding and parenting are inextricably linked. The complex bidirectional interactions between parent feeding practices and child eating behaviour shape the early feeding environment which in turn interacts with genetic predispositions to lay the foundation for life-long eating habits and health outcomes. Parent feeding and child (and parent) eating are central to the fabric of family life and are strongly rooted in culture and tradition. Yet, many parents experience stress and anxiety related to this ubiquitous parenting task and perceive their child as a “fussy eater” or a “difficult feeder.” Parents commonly misinterpret heritable and developmentally “normal” child eating behaviour, such as food refusal, as cause for concern. In an effort to get their child to “eat well” they respond with coercive feeding practices, such as pressure, reward and restriction. Emotional feeding that uses food to comfort, distract, calm or shape behaviour is also common. Although well intentioned, these non-responsive, parent- rather than child-centred feeding practices are ineffective, even counterproductive. They teach children to eat for reasons unrelated to appetite and, hence, more than they need and fail to support development of healthy food preferences and appetite regulation. Early feeding interventions are needed that assist parents to understand normal child eating behaviour and promote responsive feeding practices and effective food parenting. The aim of this chapter is to review (1) “normal” eating behaviour of young children, (2) the range of feeding practices and strategies that parents use to respond to and try to shape these behaviours, (3) evidence for approaches to feeding young children that have potential to reduce conflict related to child feeding and promote life-long healthy eating patterns that are a key determinant of long-term health and well-being and (4) to provide an overview of an early feeding intervention, NOURISH, which demonstrated a positive impact on maternal feeding practices and potentially reduced parent anxiety and stress related to feeding.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Changes in rituals and routines between drinking and sobriety were examined in families in treatment due to paternal alcohol abuse. Information was gathered through a semistructured family interview. Recurrent disruptions of rituals and routines were found between different phases in the drinking cycle. Disruptions were found typically with regard to the fathers’ participation in rituals and routines, the parental roles and responsibility, the affective quality of the rituals, and the general family climate. Four categories of families were distinguished based on amount and type of disruptions in family rituals and routines (i.e. protecting, emotional disruptive, exposing, and chaotic families). Implications for intervention are described.",

      "abstract": "Parents are known to provide a lasting basis for their children's social development. Understanding parent-driven socialization is particularly relevant in adolescence, as an increasing social independence is developed. However, the relationship between key parenting styles of care and control and the microlevel expression of daily-life social interactions has been insufficiently studied. Adolescent and young adult twins and their nontwin siblings (N = 635; mean age = 16.6; age range = 14.2-21.9; 58.6% female; 79.5% in or having completed higher secondary/tertiary education; 2.8% speaking language other than Dutch at home) completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) on parental care and control. Participants also completed a 6-day experience sampling period (10 daily beeps, mean compliance = 68.0%) to assess daily-life social interactions. Higher overall parental bonding quality (of both parents) related to more positive social experiences in daily life (e.g., belonging in company), but not to more social behaviors (e.g., being with others). Factor analysis indicated a three-factor structure of the PBI, with care, denial of psychological autonomy, and encouragement of behavioral freedom. Paternal care was uniquely predictive of better social experiences. These findings demonstrate how parenting styles may be uniquely associated with how adolescents experience their social world, with a potentially important role for fathers in particular. This complements the long-held idea of socialization through parenting by bringing it into the context of daily life and implies how both conceptualizations of social functioning and interventions aimed at alleviating social dysfunction might benefit from a stronger consideration of day-to-day social experiences.

      "abstract": "Children with complex health care needs are an emerging population that commonly requires long-term supportive services. A growing body of evidence has highlighted that these children and their families experience significant challenges. Many of these challenges involve ethical concerns that have been under-recognized. In this article, we (a) outline ethical concerns that arise in clinical practice with children with complex health care needs and their families (e.g.: exclusion of children's voices in discussions and decisions that affect them; difficulties in defining their best interests; clashes across the array of social roles that parents manage; limited recognition of the ethical significance of parents' and other family members' interests) and (b) propose a relational ethics framework for addressing these concerns. Our framework draws on hermeneutical interpretation and moral experience as foundational orientations, recognizing children with complex health care needs as relationally embedded agents, who while dependent and entitled to protection, are simultaneously agential. Children's and parents' interests are relationally intertwined and interdependent. Families are recognized as significant social microcosms for the cultivation and transmission of intergenerational cultural heritage, narratives, and outlooks. We describe strategies for (a) conducting a relational ethics inquiry and (b) reconciliation of identified ethical concerns through a process of rapprochement. A relational ethics framework can promote clinical practices that are ethically attuned to the complexity of this population's needs.",

      "abstract": "Adult children who care for aging parents incur costs along psychic, monetary, emotional, and even physical dimensions. What motivates them? Is it altruism, guilt, obligation, or gratitude? Perhaps the anticipation of a bequest? Familial norms, or desire for recognition? Understanding motivation for care is high on the agenda of both economics and sociology. A primary focus of economics is the prospect that public transfers may supplant or stimulate private transfers, depending on the motivation of the private donor. Motives are usually inferred indirectly, on the basis of observed behavior. In contrast, sociologists focus on how familial bonds and networks might be forged and maintained. We depart from each of these approaches to focus on direct questions from a special module in the Health and Retirement Study, which contains questions on motivations for, and concerns about, the provision of familial assistance. Our (deliberately) simple descriptive work reveals abundant new information about motivation for familial transfers and care. These not always provided free of pressure from relatives, for example, and obligations and traditions appear to matter. Findings suggest that the standard economic considerations like utility interdependence or exchange provide an incomplete account of transfer behavior, and that insights from sociological models are essential. We also find that women are far more likely to provide care and take seriously family obligations. Past experience in the provision of financial help and care matters as well, sometimes in intriguingly anomalous ways. Though self-reported motivations must be interpreted carefully, we nonetheless conclude that \"point-blank\" questions provide a worthwhile complement to conventional methods for unraveling motivations for private, intergenerational transfers.",

Family caregivers provide care because of a personal relationship with the cared‐for person; care workers because of an agency–client relationship. Changing policy landscapes have signaled large‐scale withdrawal of social programs. Families may be left with little choice but to step in as alternatives are removed. Care research is moving toward diverse methodologies to create deeper understandings of the experiences of caregivers and of the frail older adults for whom they care.

      "abstract": "Parents and adult children often provide advice to one another in everyday interactions. However, few studies have examined how received advice is perceived (i.e., whether the advice was solicited or not). Unwanted advice can be a source of tensions in parent-child interactions, and may represent longstanding problems in dyadic relationships. Using data from Family Exchange Study (Wave 2), the current study examined how adult children’s perceptions of unwanted advice from parents are associated with life situations and relationship characteristics. Adult children (N = 381, aged 45–65) reported how often they perceived unwanted advice from each parent (N = 491). Multilevel models revealed that adult children were more likely to perceive unwanted advice from aging parents when they suffer major life problems (e.g., divorce, major health problem, addiction). This association was also moderated by adult children’s relationship quality with older parents. Thus, adult children suffering problems were less likely to perceive advice from parents as unwanted when they had better relationships with parents. Our findings will contribute to the literature by considering how received support is perceived in parent-child relationships, which can be critical in understanding the implications of intergenerational support for well-being.",

Ageing often accompanies decisions about ageing in place or moving ( i.e. senior living facility). Scant research compares these two living arrangements and even sparser research focuses on older women. This study, thus, poses the following questions: How do older women (aged 75+ years) experience social connectedness and perceived isolation? How does this experience vary between older women living alone in private homes and those living in assisted living facilities? Data include semi-structured interviews with women aged 75+ years who live alone in a private home or in an assisted living facility (N = 16). Findings revealed differences in three aspects of social connectedness: interactions, relationships and belonging. Private home participants' interactions underscored intentionality, with minimal investment in forging new or deeper relationships and an emphasis on belonging to the world through awareness, contribution and cognitive ability. The experiences of participants living in assisted living were characterised by availability of interactions and casual relationships. They emphasised belonging to the facility community, while positioning themselves between the status of resident and staff. Surprisingly, most participants in both groups did not express feelings of perceived isolation. Both had adapted their social connectedness expectations to reflect their current situation.",

Children living with alternative families (with adoptive or foster parents or with other relatives) display fewer behavior problems than children living with two biological parents, a single biological parent, or a biological and a stepparent. The proportion of mentally ill family members and the degree of mother-child discord explain the vanations in children's behavior problems among the different living arrangements.

The changes of and around marriage and sexuality are in the centre of these trends. One of the consequences is the following.

Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we construct an elaborate measure of family structure and find considerable heterogeneity in the risk of antisocial and delinquent behavior among groups of youth who reside in what are traditionally dichotomized as intact and nonintact families. In particular, we find that youth in “intact” families differ in important ways depending on whether the two biological parents are married or cohabiting and on whether they have children from a previous relationship. In addition, we find that youth who reside with a single biological parent who cohabits with a nonbiological partner exhibit an unusually high rate of antisocial behavior, especially if the custodial parent is the biological father.",

Particularly in the vulnerable years of infancy (an especially long period in Homo sapiens), the behavioral expression of emotions, with their frequent accompaniment of interpersonal responses, enhances the likelihood of biological survival. For example, a newborn experiences the loss of physical support: his eyes open wide, his heart races, he cries; the observer interprets the child's experience as anxiety, feels his own discomfort, moves to readjust the infant to provide support. Or, a baby's mother goes away. After an initial bout of protest, the child lapses into a period of apathy and despair (\"anaclitic depression\"). This will engender in most adults a desire to provide emotional support for the child, such as physical support was rendered in the earlier instance. And similarly, even in adulthood we communicate both physiological and psychological needs through our emotional expressions, needs usually meetable and met by kith and kin.",

      "title": "The loneliness epidemic: a holistic view of its health and economic implications in older age",
      "abstract": "Loneliness has been described as an epidemic and is one of the most pressing public health concerns in Australia and internationally.1, 2 In contrast to social isolation, which is an objective measure of social interactions and relationships, loneliness is defined as a subjective experience where one perceives a discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships in terms of quality or quantity.3 Although it is common and natural to feel lonely at times, prolonged and intense periods of loneliness have been linked to adverse health outcomes.4 Older adults are more prone to loneliness and social isolation compared with other age groups.5 Reasons for this include significant life transitions and events, such as retiring from work, increased financial difficulties, loss of friends and widowhood, changes in living arrangements (eg, transitioning to residential aged care), increase in solitary living, and a decline in both health and independence.5, 6 Older people at particular risk of loneliness include those living on low incomes, living with a disability, living in rural areas or with housing stress, who are single, childless or living alone, who are vulnerable or at risk of elder abuse, and those with low levels of literacy or communication technology skills (Box).7 A growing body of evidence has highlighted the significant health burden associated with loneliness, with more recent studies also suggesting that loneliness has become an economic problem due to an increase in service use and demand for institutional care. This development requires both effective and cost-effective strategies to tackle loneliness.11, 12 A recent meta-analysis found that 28.5% of older people aged 60 years and above experience some degree of loneliness.13 Although the study did not observe that loneliness is more common in people aged over 75 years than in those aged 65–75 years, other studies have found that the old (75–84 years) and oldest old (≥ 85 years) are more affected by loneliness than the youngest old (65–74 years).1, 14 The prevalence of loneliness among institutionalised older adults is less well documented but a recent meta-analysis estimated the mean prevalence of moderate and severe loneliness in older people living in care homes at 61% and 35% respectively.15 Determining the prevalence of loneliness remains a challenge due to its subjective nature, the stigma attached to it, and measurement problems. The use of a direct, single-question measure of loneliness appears to be commonly applied in national surveys and research studies because it is simple and generates fewer missing values. On the flip side, such measures are prone to ambiguous interpretation of the term loneliness and under-reporting due to the stigma attached to loneliness, suggesting the need for a multi-item measure of loneliness.16 Further, achieving an accurate and representative sample of the study population is often comprised by online-based surveys, meaning that many older adults cannot be easily reached, which can result in skewed estimates. Loneliness and social isolation have been linked to common chronic diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, diabetes, dementia and depression.17 Loneliness and social isolation also increase the risk of premature death by 26% and 29% respectively.18 Loneliness can adversely affect health through various pathways, such as direct influences on lifestyle, health behaviours, and health care utilisation. In addition, it can lead to heightened or excessive stress responses (reduced stress-buffering) and hinder physiological repair and maintenance processes (eg, insufficient sleep).19 Although loneliness and social isolation may increase the chance of developing a chronic condition, living with a chronic condition is also associated with an increased risk of loneliness and social isolation,20 highlighting the bi-directional relationship. Further research in this area is urgently needed to truly understand the nature of this relationship and ultimately how we might be able to best address it. With the number of people living with chronic conditions on the rise, there is an urgent need for a holistic approach for chronic conditions management to address loneliness and social isolation. A recent report from the United States suggested that loneliness and social isolation among older adults alone accounts for an estimated US$6.7 billion in excess Medicare spending annually.2 In Australia, the total cost of loneliness was estimated around $2.7 billion (or $1565 for each person who becomes or remains lonely), where older adults aged 55 years or older accounted for more than a third of the costs.21 These costs are mainly associated with increases in health service use (ie, general practice and hospital visits), sick leave and lifestyle behaviour (ie, physical inactivity, regular smoking, and excessive alcohol use). There has been a growing number of studies showing that loneliness is associated with greater health service use, such as doctor visits, emergency department visits and hospital admissions.11, 22 Although older adults experiencing loneliness may exhibit a higher prevalence of chronic conditions that result in increased health service use, others have hypothesised that lonely older people are more likely to visit physicians to meet their need for interaction and interpersonal stimulation.22 In addition, loneliness has been identified as a risk factor for care home admission, suggesting that tackling loneliness among older adults may delay or even reduce the demand for institutional care.23 However, research in this area is still in its infancy and requires further investigation, addressing some conflicting results reported in the existing literature.24 Besides such cost-of-illness studies that provide a better understanding of the economic burden of a particular illness on society, to guide resources allocation decisions in health care, there is also a need for cost-effectiveness evidence, which is imperative to provide decision makers with the important information to inform investment decisions. Although some studies have found that a few interventions that aim to reduce loneliness provide value for money,12, 25 differences in the methods and contexts of studies mean that they are not comparable and cannot be used for integrated decision making. Further cost-effectiveness evidence is urgently needed, adopting a holistic priority-setting framework and consistent methodology. Given that loneliness is considered a modifiable risk factor, numerous interventions have been developed to reduce or prevent loneliness in older adults. Current loneliness interventions that have been explored among older people can be classified into six categories: social facilitation interventions, psychological therapies, health and social care provision, animal interventions, befriending interventions, and leisure/skill development.8 Some evidence suggests that the most effective interventions are group interventions, such as educational and social activity programs, that are directed at specific groups.25 Within the context of long term care facilities, strategies that are most effective include psychological therapies and leisure/skills development interventions, where laughter therapy, horticultural (gardening) therapy, and reminiscence therapy were associated with the greatest decrease in loneliness.9 Overall, interventions that seem to be most promising are those that consider adaptability to local contexts and include holistic community development approaches.8 However, evidence around effective interventions to address loneliness in older adults is still lacking and compromised by small samples and quasi-experimental designs that lack a control group. Variability in study designs and loneliness measures also limits the ability to calculate pooled effectiveness estimates to guide and develop effective policy responses. In order to address loneliness effectively, it is also important to understand the underlying risk factors of loneliness. These can be categorised into individual factors (eg, gender, race, socio-economic status, living arrangement, health problems), societal factors (eg, absence of support, lack of social networks or social opportunities), loss of relationships (eg, relocation, divorce, bereavement), and community factors (eg, no access to public spaces, geographic isolation, lack of transportation).5, 26 When designing interventions or policies, it is crucial to recognise that many of the risk factors for loneliness are interrelated and that each person is defined by a whole set of characteristics that can be related to loneliness in a different way. In view of demographic changes, where intergenerational living is declining and one-person households are on the rise, coupled with greater social and geographical mobility, loneliness in older adults is likely to remain on an upward trajectory. The loss of community resources, such as libraries and post offices, particularly in some rural areas, further exacerbates loneliness among community-dwelling older adults, requiring a stronger policy response. There is a need to move towards an integrated and holistic, person-centred view to tackle loneliness, integrating and adjusting interventions to the right person. However, current approaches focus on a single intervention for the entire population (\"one-size-fits-all\"), thereby ignoring the heterogeneity of loneliness, its underlying causes, and the unique requirements (such as individual coping mechanisms) and contextual factors (such as sociocultural environments) specific to individuals facing loneliness. Interventions must prioritise age, cultural, and gender appropriateness, considering the unique environmental and social determinants that contribute to loneliness across different groups. This includes being attentive to the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse communities and ensuring inclusivity for diverse groups, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults. It is also important to understand the subjective and heterogeneous nature of loneliness, emphasising the need to better understand older people's lived experiences of loneliness. Recognising that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, the provision of services and their implementation need to be tailored to the needs of the communities and consumer preferences, adopting a person-centred approach that includes the involvement of older people with lived experiences in the design of interventions. There is also a need for a holistic priority-setting framework that provides actionable insight into decisions about where to invest, into what kind of interventions, and whom to target, requiring both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evidence of interventions tackling loneliness.

      "abstract": "The selection of a suitable foster home for a child would be a relatively simple business if foster children and foster parents were simple in their emotional make-up. The foster parent who might give excellent care to one child may be so affected by a specific problem in another child that his behaviour is altered drastically. The fact that a child's behaviour elicits the same kind of response from more than one adult should strongly suggest to us that the child is behaving purposefully, but unconsciously, in a way that elicits this kind of response because of his underlying need to recreate his early environment and pattern of relationships. In addition to normal good mothering, a child with this kind of problem needs a foster mother who, with help, is able to ignore the defensive pattern of behaviour, and who will feel comfortable and not need to interfere when the child turns to someone else.",

      "abstract": "We examined whether substance use disorder (SUD) before age 19 was associated with functioning at age 30 in 773 individuals assessed twice during adolescence, and at ages 24 and 30.Eight of 14 adult measures were associated with adolescent SUD: education, unemployment, income, risky sexual behavior, suicide attempt, coping, stressful life events, and global adjustment.Controlling for adolescent comorbidity and functioning and adult SUD, education and unemployment remained associated, and three variables emerged as significant: being a parent (significant only for participants without adult SUD), and being currently married and decreased life satisfaction (significant only for participants with adult SUD).Adolescent SUD is associated with numerous functioning difficulties at age 30, some of which appear to be related to recurrent SUD, comorbid adolescent disorders, or functioning problems already evident in adolescence.The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical period when young people are expected to assume a number of new responsibilities that often include completing one's education, obtaining a job and launching a career, becoming financially independent, developing romantic relationships, getting married, becoming a parent, developing an adult social support system, and maintaining good physical health.The degree to which experiencing a substance use disorder (SUD; i.e., psychoactive substance abuse or dependence) during adolescence is associated with difficulties in accomplishing these tasks and responsibilities during the transition into adulthood is the focus of the present study.",

In ordinary circumstances, babies begin to acquire a rudimentary sense of time very early on. For many fostered and adopted children, the conditions for developing a sense of time are often not present. Many children who end up being taken into care have been neglected for very long periods of time—left unfed, unwashed, and forgotten. Many have early lives characterized by erratic and unpredictable parenting; many have their sense of security severely damaged by early experiences of emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse. The consequences of this kind of start in life are disastrous. In addition to missing out on the experience of regularity so central to ordinary development, there is often also limited opportunity for the sorting out of feelings and impulses associated with particular stages in a child's life.",

      "abstract": "Elder family financial exploitation (EFFE) is widely recognized as the most prevalent and growing type of elder abuse. This study provides needed insight into how family members, other than the direct victim and the perpetrator, experience the costs and consequences of financial exploitation of an older parent by someone in their own family. Guided by a social constructivism qualitative research design and human ecological systems theory, a purposeful sample of 28 family members who had experienced EFFE participated in personal interviews and completed brief written surveys. Participating family members were primarily an adult child of an older parent/victim, and a sibling of the primary perpetrator, married, with a mean age of 59 years. The findings reflect EFFE has consequences for family relationships, family functioning, and the individual health and well-being of non-perpetrator/non-victim family members. Some type of loss was an overarching theme with a focus on a) loss of relationships and roles given the need to redefine who’s family, “cutting off” processes and outcomes, resignation and acceptance; and b) the loss of relational dynamics (broken trust, respect, closeness, honesty). Participants described a range of personal emotional and physical health consequences. In some contexts consequences were also positive with strengthened relationship quality and dynamics with selected family members. Overall, family members emphasized it was the emotional and social consequences that mattered, not personal financial losses. The findings help to inform intervention strategies to help reduce the costs and consequences of EFFE on family systems and larger society.",

      "abstract": "The ability of parents to maintain visitation with their child after a care order is a complex aspect of child welfare. While visitation is widely recognized as essential for preserving family bonds and supporting potential reunification, less attention has been given to how broader life circumstances influence a parent’s ability to engage in visitation. This study explores how parents describe their life situation after a care order and examines how different contextual factors may relate to their visitation capacity. The study employs thematic analysis based on interviews with 31 parents whose children were placed in public care. The findings reveal that parents face multiple barriers that affect their ability to sustain meaningful contact with their child, including emotional and psychological strain, social isolation and stigma, trust and cooperation challenges, and shifting parent–child relationship dynamics. Many parents described profound distress following the care order, marked by anxiety, grief, and loss of parental identity. Additionally, strained relationships with child welfare professionals, inconsistent expectations, and systemic barriers further complicate their efforts to remain engaged. These findings highlight that visitation capacity is not merely a matter of legal access but is shaped by broader life circumstances, emotional resilience, and institutional support structures.",

      "title": "Involving fathers in community child health services and asthma: an update",
      "abstract": "Men in antenatal classes give three common reasons why they intend to father differently than they were fathered: community expectations, partner pressure, and their own wish for connection with their child. 1. Community expectations: highlight the fact that fathers are expected to be involved in the day-to-day care of their baby, not simply to be a provider and protector.  2. Partner pressure: “She’ll kill me [if I don’t]”: the second reason is offered with some humour by the fathers-to-be. The wives or partners of these men will insist on their taking a different, more hands-on approach than fathers of previous generations. 3. Their own wish to connect with their child: “Because I want to have a good relationship with my kid, that’s why I am doing this,” is usually expressed by one of the men, and the others nod in affirmation and this captures perhaps the most profound change in our understanding of a father’s role. There is a recently developed awareness that the pathway to having good relationships with children and teenagers starts early, and these men want to be involved in caring activities when their children are infants.  ---------------------------- While most children with asthma can participate in and enjoy all of their normal childhood activities, asthma is also the most common medical reason for children to be admitted to hospital and a significant community health problem. In an asthma attack, the bronchi in the lungs narrow because the muscles tighten and the walls of the bronchial tubes become inflamed. This narrowing makes it harder to take in air and causes wheezing, coughing and difficulty breathing. While one in ten Australian children are diagnosed as having asthma (‘Asthma and asthma management’, 2012), one in four will experience wheezing at some point in their childhood (‘Asthma’, n.d.). Not all childhood wheezing is necessarily asthma, which can be difficult to diagnose in young children (‘Medication for children’, n.d.). Related identifier: ISSN 2202 0667",

Many of them are not free for adoption or have no adoptive parents in prospect. The need of many of them for permanent or long-term foster care has been pointed out.2 For some of these the formal and personal relationship of guardian and ward is believed by this writer to be appropriate not only from a legal standpoint but from a social standpoint as well. Such a status could contribute much to their emotional security and their identity in the home and the community.3 The institution of guardian and ward is well established in legal history.4 The parents of some children in need of parents5' may be unwilling to consent to their adoption. Yet their have not been so completely abandoned or so seriously neglected as to be freed for adoption without their consent. Other parents may have delayed in reaching a decision to give the in adoption until the are too old to be in demand or to accept strangers easily in the place of parents. Some are handicapped in ways that make licensed agencies hesitate to recommend them for adoption. Some are belonging to minority groups in which little tradition of formal adoption exists. Despite the need for permanent homes many such continue to live under temporary and unsatisfactory arrangements when they need and hunger for responsible, intimate, and durable relationships. These are receiving substitute care in various ways. Some are in the homes of relatives where the relatives, the parents, voluntary or governmental agencies support them.

      "abstract": "Adolescence—typically defined as ages between 10 and 19—is a period of physiological and socio-behavioral development. Characterized by an imbalance in the neurological development that governs the reward/emotion pathways and cognitive functioning as well as a shift toward more complex dynamics in their social environments, adolescents exhibit a unique vulnerability to substance use/misuse. Also importantly, adolescent substance use/misuse has a long-lasting impact on a wide array of current and future development and well-being, including neuropsychological growth, other risky behaviors, and behavioral health outcomes. The costly and long-lasting consequences of adolescent substance use/misuse underscore the importance of early identification and intervention (both prevention and treatment) to promote adolescents’ healthy development. Despite the overall decline over the past decades in the United States, a large proportion of adolescents continues to engage in substance use/misuse, raising public concerns. With the increasing roles of peers and communities as well as the continued importance of family in substance use initiation and persistent use, an effective intervention approach must account for the influences of these multilevel systems by touching on modifiable determinants at the individual, family, peer, school/community, and macro levels. Furthermore, the ever-changing landscape of substance use/misuse in the United States, such as cannabis legalization, the increasing need for culturally responsive treatment, and the introduction of new technology, need to be considered to guide future directions for effective prevention and treatment.",

      "title": "Coping with bereavement",
      "abstract": "Over the course of a lifespan, most people will be confronted with the loss of a close relationship: if attachments have been formed, one is likely to have to suffer the consequences of separation. The term ‘bereavement’ refers to the situation of a person who has recently experienced the loss of someone significant in their lives through that person's death (see ‘Coping with death and dying’). The loss of a family member – such as a parent, partner, sibling or child – are typical examples, although the death of other important relationships – such as a meaningful friendship, classmate or good neighbour – may also be significant. Bereavements evoke grief, which can be defined as a primarily emotional (affective) reaction to the loss through death of a loved one. Affective reactions include yearning and pining and intense feelings of distress over the loss of the deceased person. Grief also incorporates diverse psychological and physical manifestations. The former type of manifestation includes cognitive and social-behavioural reactions such as self-blame and withdrawal from others. The latter includes physiological/somatic reactions, such as head- and stomach ache, and increased vulnerability to diseases. Sometimes mourning is used interchangeably with grief. However, there are good reasons to define mourning as the social expressions or acts expressive of grief that are shaped by the practices of a given society or cultural group. It is worth noting that researchers following the psychoanalytic tradition often use the term ‘mourning’ rather than ‘grief ’ to denote the psychological reaction to bereavement.",

Such child caretaking varies widely in its frequency, as well as in the degree of institutionalization, relationship to parental caretaking, degree of indulgence, and incidence at differing ages. Residence and household patterns, size of the family, and the subsistence economy, daily routines, and work load of the family are important in determining availability of child caretakers in the home. The United States appears to have fewer alternative caretakers available, and less child caretaking, than most societies. Child caretaking is related to a number of developmental areas during childhood; eight are suggestedin this review: (1) mother-child relationships and attachment; (2) conceptions and emergence of childhood stages; (3) formation and organization of play groups; (4) development of social responsibility; (5) sex differences; (6) development of individual diferences; (7) development of cognitive-style differences; and (8) motivation and classroom performance.",

It is only when the child has developed to the point of perceiving the similarity of his own experiences and that of others that he may be said to be social. Social life satisfies many basic needs but is not imperative for their satisfaction. To assist in measuring the development of the individual from early infancy and to delineate individual differences, social patterns may be differentiated into three types: (1) an initiated act to induce another into the realm of influence; (2) a response to the initiated act; and (3) maintaining one's self in a social situation without contributing to it. There is never just social action but always social interaction. Each response is determined not only by what has gone before but also by what is expected.",

      "title": "Teenage depression: a cultural-interpersonal-intrapsychic perspective.",
      "abstract": "The \"crossroads families\" are caught between old value systems and American mainstream goals. Traditional family and sex-related roles and orientations conflict with those of the new social system. In turn, neither of the teenager's orientations--toward home or toward peer activity--is validated. In the clinical case presented, Anna, at adolescence, wants to relinquish many of her household chores and enter her social world more fully. She needs unconflictual support for such a move. If this does not take place, her autonomous movement represents an unconscious betrayal of her depleted and controlling mother as well as an abandonment of the parental coalition. This leaves her feeling resentful, guilty, and ultimately unlovable. Attitudes marked by helplessness and confusion are thus significant to the depressed affect that brings this teenager into family therapy. Teenagers of non-Hispanic background who enter family therapy reveal gross overlap with teenagers of the Hispanic \"crossroads\" family model. Here, the family gives mixed messages for homebound and intimate closeness as well as accomplishment in the societal mainstream. A primary difference between ethnic groups involves the freer expressions of anger and pain between husband and wife in the non-Hispanic families. This is not similar to the backgrounds of the more individuated Hispanic teenagers. While more open expressions of anger within the family do indicate higher levels of autonomy, the hostility that is expressed by the parents presents serious complications when this includes \"triangulating\" the child into the family tension. Here, as cited, the mother often uses her daughter as a confidant and ally at times of severe parental discord. This places additional strain on the child's conflict with separation. Importantly, the daughter experiences renewed rejection and betrayal when the mother \"submits\" to her spouse. These are significant family processes that heighten mixed messages around autonomy. Milagros, a depressed (more individuated) adolescent, is consistently entangled into her parent's abrasive relationship. Her interpersonal family struggles have become intrapsychic and, ultimately, transferential.",

      "title": "The Emergence of “Family Integrity” in Later Life",
      "abstract": "In contrast to the rich and abundant literature on the early stages of the family life cycle, there are relatively few theoretical accounts of family developmental processes in the second half of life. In an effort to address this imbalance, we introduce the concept of “family integrity” to refer to the ultimate, positive outcome of an older adult's developmental striving toward meaning, connection, and continuity within his or her multigenerational family. Subjectively, for the older adult, family integrity may be experienced as a deep and abiding sense of peace and/or satisfaction with his or her multigenerational family relationships, past, present, and future. It is the result of a growing concern for relational closure that typically begins to emerge in mid‐life and gains ascendance in later‐life. Objectively, at the level of observable relational processes, it is manifest in three interrelated competencies of the family as a system: (a) the transformation of relationships over time in a manner that is dynamic and responsive to the changing life cycle needs of individual family members, (b) the resolution or acceptance of past losses or family conflicts, with the dead as well as the living, and (c) the shared creation of meaning by passing on individual and family legacies within and across generations. As a construct, family integrity involves processes at multiple levels of social organization. At the individual level, it refers to an older adult's inner experience of satisfaction or “completeness” in the context of his or her family relationships. At the family level, it refers to observable relational competencies and transactions that contribute directly to an elder's sense of meaning, purpose, and connection with others. Simultaneously, at the level of culture and society, there are values and rituals that influence whether individuals experience meaning and purpose within the multigenerational family.",

      "abstract": "Most adults experience childhood amnesia: They have very few memories of events prior to 3 to 4 years of age. Nevertheless, some early memories are retained. Multiple factors likely are responsible for the survival of early childhood memories, including external representations such as videos, photographs, and conversations about past experiences, which help sustain memories over time. The present research was an experimental test of whether repeated recounting of past events influences young children's recall during a year delay. Twenty-four mothers and their 4-year-old children talked repeatedly about two randomly selected personal events that were assigned to become family-story events. Mothers were asked not to initiate conversations about two other randomly selected events (control events). A year later, children were interviewed by an experimenter about all four events. In free recall, children retrieved more of the family-story than the control events. With the aid of Wh- questions, levels of retrieval no longer differed. Moreover, the completeness and organization of children's narratives did not depend on whether they were about family-story or control events. The pattern of results suggests that repeated conversations about a past event help to maintain accessibility of the memory but may not substantially impact the integrity of the memory trace itself. The role of family stories in children's social and autobiographical memory development is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Older people’s social participation is being shaped by the current context of “liquid modernity,” characterized by the erosion of traditional roles and identity, fragile social ties, individualism, economic precariousness, and uncertainty. The challenges entailed by these trends can be exacerbated when a circumstance, such as being the parent of an adult with a physical disability, is combined with old age. This study aimed to explore how this dual condition influences processes of aging and community participation. This work presents the findings of a phenomenological study conducted in 2025 through semi-structured interviews with a sample of 24 elderly people with children diagnosed with spina bifida. The results show that the children’s support needs, especially when they live with their parents, but also if they have become independent, impact the parents’ aging and social participation processes. Likewise, concern for the future is identified as a recurring aspect due to the children’s lack of support from a social network. It was concluded that public administrations and non-profit organizations should develop social intervention strategies aimed at promoting social participation, guaranteeing external assistance in the home, and providing coexistence resources.",

      "abstract": "Foster-family care seems to promise children who must leave their own home for some type of foster care the closest approximation to normal life in their own home. The close and continuing relationship with responsible adults and the opportunities to participate in family and community life should provide a corrective and growth experience for the children in care. Casework services with parents should enable them to re-establish a home for their children or to move ahead on permanent planning for their children. The effectiveness of the use of foster-family care is tested against its promise. Inescap ably the conclusion must be that it has failed to meet the expectations of social agencies and communities. A disappoint ing proportion of children return to parents or are placed for adoption; ever growing numbers of children are remaining for long periods in foster-family care. For the latter children, the prospect seems bleak and unrewarding. Parents are \"lost\" to many of the children; many children exhibit emotional and social problems. As the conditions under which care has been given are examined, it becomes painfully clear that, for many children, the promise of foster-family care was doomed to fail from the start. But it is also clear that the promise is there if the profession, the social agencies, and the communities pursue a dedicated, thoughtful approach to its fulfillment. In the dis tress over what has happened to many children, it should not be forgotten that, for many others, foster-family care did provide security, love, and opportunity for a new and better life.",

      "title": "Raising the Cut-Off: The Empirical Case for Extending Adoption and Guardianship Subsidies from Age 18 to 21",
      "abstract": "Few children become financially independent at age 18. Adolescents often (and increasingly) rely financially on their parents or caretakers until an older age. Such reliance is likely to be greater among children who have been abused or neglected by their birth families, and who, by court finding, could not reunify with their parents. Parental abuse and neglect is often associated with special needs in children, and the dislocation from birth families to the foster care system imposes a short-term, and sometimes lasting, trauma. A disproportionate number of such children have a mental illness, behavioral challenges, or learning disability that may require the provision of services. Many children involved in foster care lose one or more years of school or have to repeat grades, leaving them living at home enrolled fulltime in secondary school past the age of 18. Adoption and guardianship subsidies may offset part of the cost of accepting permanent responsibility for the care of a child who has been in foster care. But not all adoption and guardianship subsidies can be extended to cover costs of support past the age of 18. We explore the effects of extending adoption subsidies to age 21. Does extending subsidies increase the number of adoptions and legal guardianships from state foster care systems? Administrative data from state child welfare systems strongly suggests that the answer is affirmative.",

There are certainly many more scenarios, but the point is that one must be careful when talking about the impact of day care because its quality, the reasons for which it is used, and by whom are key factors in determining what the impacts are.",

As compared with normal subjects, the schizophrenia patients were less likely to be married, less likely to have children, more likely to live alone, and had fewer friendships. The patients were, however, similar to comparison subjects on the following family-relationship variables: frequency of contact, instrumental support received, presence of a family confidant, and extent of interpersonal difficulties. These findings do not support the stereotype of older schizophrenia patients as being estranged from family members. The need for developing interventions that use key family members to interface with service providers and to monitor treatment compliance and continuity of care is discussed.",

On reaching middle age schizophrenic males become more adaptive in the family due to the fact that in the course of the disease their psychopathlike and asocial behaviour becomes less marked. Females both young and elderly usually have a higher status although in the course of disease it tends to show a gradual lowering.

      "abstract": "There are theoretical foundations in sociology for two seemingly incompatible positions: (1) children should have a strong negative impact on the psychological well-being of parents and (2) children should have a strong positive impact on the psychological well-being of parents. Most empirical analyses yield only a modest relationship between parenthood and psychological well-being. Usually, but not always, it is negative. In this study we consider the relationship between parental status and several dimensions of psychological well-being. Our analysis is based on data from a large national survey. It suggests that children have positive and negative effects on the psychological well-being of parents. The balance of positive and negative effects associated with parenthood depends on residential status of the child, age of youngest child, marital status of the parent, and the particular dimension of psychological well-being examined. When compared with nonparents, parents with children in the home have low levels of affective well-being and satisfaction, and high levels of life-meaning; parents with adult children living away from home have high levels of affective well-being, satisfaction, and life-meaning. The widowed appear to benefit most from parenthood and the divorced appear to experience the greatest costs.",

      "abstract": "The family commonly plays a key role in early intervention. At this stage the person experiencing difficulties is often not in contact with professionals and relies on support from within their natural social environment. The value of family interventions in early intervention is evidenced across a very wide range of disorders and across the lifespan. There can be a problem defining what family intervention means as there are many different delivery modalities. Common features and principles include the family being seen as a resource rather than a hindrance. The intervention usually contains a psychoeducational element, and in addition emotional issues such as those linked with loss are addressed. The practical elements include building the family's coping strengths, and there is usually a focus on communication. The relationship with professionals is collaborative and families have choices around what the intervention will entail. A nonjudgemental approach is employed with the family being seen as expert. The treatment is often delivered in the home environment, and should be phase-specific, addressing the stage that the person is at whether dealing with disorders such as dementia or psychosis. Access to services is generally better if family is involved, effects are produced more quickly, and family work tends to prevent dropout. The benefits include the optimisation of outcomes for those with the difficulties and those caring for them. They are cost effective generally resulting in cost savings due to reductions in relapse rates or in the need for expensive residential treatments. Problems with implementation and widespread adoption are common as family approaches can be perceived as resource intensive in the short term, and clinicians may lack training and confidence in their delivery. However, the benefits become apparent over time. They have been found to be applicable in different cultural groups.",

      "abstract": "Not all older persons will experience dementia but dementia is, by a wide margin, most likely to be experienced by persons age 65 and older. This chapter examines how characteristic relationship patterns and family dynamics of later life intersect with the experience of dementia in old age, and the ways in which law has responded to those intersections to create a distinct subgenre of family law focused on the older parent/adult child and late-life spousal relationships. At a historical moment when family members are normatively independent, no longer defined in relation to one another by traditional socially defined roles, family caregiving of older parents/spouses with dementia remains the expectation (despite decreased availability of the \"free\" female labour provided by daughters and daughters in law in the past). Concerns about capacity, undue influence, caregiving expectations, exploitation, and abuse may arise in the context of both old and new spousal relationships (with distinctive causes and implications). The older parent/adult child dynamic is multifaceted and complex, as old resentments and sensitivities about intra-familial fairness mix with new obligations and concerns about parental vulnerability to exploitation and harm (of which adult children may also be a source).",

      "title": "Ritualization in the human infant-mother bond",
      "abstract": "My purpose is to point up the significance of some of the very earliest forms of ritual behaviour manifested in human ontogeny. These occur within the context of the early mother-infant relationship and, because in fact any aspect of the interactions between mother and infant may become ritualized, I must first distinguish between two broad kinds of ritual behaviour in this context. Both may be said to be patterns of behaviour which occur with great regularity and little deviation in specific kinds of situation. The first kind are essentially culturally prescribed and consist of maternal care-taking practices that show a rigidity and conformity in both form and repetitiveness that may far exceed the requirements for mutual personal adjustment between the infant and his mother. These ritualized practices, in both primitive and modern societies, are all methods of coping with the young infant’s helplessness, fragility and susceptibility to illness, and their prime function has to do with promoting the infant’s immediate survival. Among primitive societies, for example, one of the commonest sources of ritual practice by mothers is ‘evil-eye’ (e.g. Romney &amp; Romney 1963). This arises from the infant being stared at by witches or by other women who may be jealous of the infant. Its symptoms may be vomiting or fever, and death may ensue. Various protective practices are adopted by mothers in different societies: for example, putting a black dot on the baby’s temple or foot, putting scissors or crossed sticks at the head or foot of the crib to cut any evil powers, or putting a string of nuts around the baby’s waist to ward off any evil. In our own society, one of the most widespread care-taking rituals is scheduled feeding according to the clock, which is still often maintained with the strictest regularity and rigidity",

He abandoned his family and work in order to better serve his old, disabled but over demanding mother who frequently insulted and humiliated him. Suddenly he came to a state of \"mental confusion\" and strangled her. After the crime, the perpetrator manifested the symptoms of a bipolar disorder and also received the diagnosis of dependant personality disorder. Years later, he presented again a crisis of escalating aggressive urge for which he was hospitalized. Many people and associations of his hometown actively demanded the minimal possible punishment for him. The case is discussed especially concerning: a) hypotheses about the aetiopathogeny of the act, b) the constant support provided to the perpetrator by his family and social environment.",

      "title": "Potrzeby w zakresie edukacji seksualnej dzieci z rodzin dysfunkcyjnych – wybrane zagadnienia",
      "abstract": "This article explores the need for sex education that results when the modern family’s fulfilment of its care-giving and educational functions is problematized (i.e. families in which there are elements of addiction, aggression, violence, helplessness and failure, life-related, educational or mental disorders, somatic diseases, etc.). In such cases, families are not able to ensure a proper upbringing for their children, and this extends to matters pertaining to sex education. The existing literature highlights the close relationship that exists between the maturation of children and the sexual behaviour of the corresponding adult humans – including the gender, social roles and attitudes of those significantly involved in increasing the child’s own awareness. It is mainly the specific, credible and convincing attitudinal patterns of adults (usually parents) that are responsible for influencing the normal sexual development of children and young people. Children, as good observers, often confront their dreams and ideas about a happy family with reality. In the case of children from dysfunctional families, these ideas fail to match the realities of everyday life. Generally, where children from such families are concerned, the decisions of family courts aim at offering a respite of one sort or another (usually in the form of an institutional retreat), with responsibilities in the field of sex education being taken over by teaching staff. The main task of educators is, then, to meet the needs of children and young people arising from the family situation, from experiences (i.e. injuries) stemming from being educated under special conditions, and from their age, level of development and individual capabilities. In the course of their care-giving and educational work, educators are supposed to eliminate aggression and violence from the lives of their pupils. In order to fully implement goals in the field of sex education, they must strive to create an educational atmosphere similar to that of the family, conducive to the implementation of the individual needs of pupils, and to establishing positive interpersonal relationships between educators and children. Educators, conscious of their role in this regard, should ensure that their own behaviour provides young people with positive models for rehearsing the attitudes associated with being male or female – attitudes important for shaping the identities of the children. That is why sex education for children and young people must take into account both their preparation for a satisfying intimate life, and also their emotional readiness, given that this should be based on a strong emotional bond and a sense of responsibility for the other person in the relationship.",

Unlike most disorders, it is entirely defined in terms of the individual's relationship with other people and society. There is a persistent pattern of antisocial behaviour whereby the individual repeatedly breaks social rules and carries out aggressive acts that disturb other people. This persistent tendency typically starts young – aged 2–4 years – and carries on until at least middle age. Thus a substantial proportion of children and adolescents with conduct disorder grow up to be antisocial adults, leading impoverished and destructive lifestyles; a significant minority will develop antisocial personality disorder (psychopathy). The personal impact and cost to society is high, since many domains of living are affected, and many professionals and agencies get involved in managing the sequelae. These include police and the criminal justice system, teachers and the educational system, social workers and housing agencies, and unemployment and benefit payment offices.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Maternal depression negatively impacts children's development, yet few studies have focused on fathering and the family process in cases of maternal depression. A community cohort of married/cohabitating women was recruited on the second postbirth day ( N = 1,983) and maternal depression repeatedly assessed across the first year and again at 6 years to form two cohorts: mothers chronically depressed from birth to 6 ( N = 46) and nondepressed controls ( N = 103). At 6 years, mother–child, father–child, and family interactions were observed. In families of depressed mothers, both mother and father exhibited lower sensitivity and higher intrusiveness, and children displayed lower social engagement during interactions with mother and father. Fathering moderated the effects of maternal depression on the family process. When fathers showed low sensitivity, high intrusiveness, and provided little opportunities for child social engagement, the family process was less cohesive, implying a decrease in the family's harmonious, warm, and collaborative style. However, in cases of high father sensitivity, low intrusiveness, and increased child engagement, the family process was unaffected by maternal depression. Findings describe both comparability and compensatory mechanisms in the effects of fathering on family life when maternal care is deficient, highlight the buffering role of fathers, and underscore the importance of father-focused interventions when mothers are depressed.",

The time spent with the different choices was used as an index of the animal's preference. Five of the six socially reared infants clearly preferred their mother to the other choices, whereas only one (the youngest) of the six infants reared alone with its mother showed a preference for her. Most of the mothers in both groups did not show any preference among the four choices, although two mothers from the social group and two from the restricted group did spend considerably more time with their own infant. The differences between the two groups of infants is discussed in terms of differences in the environmental characteristics and mother‐infant relationship of the two rearing environments.",

      "abstract": "Various dementias alter many aspects of the life and interactions between older adults and their families. This is particularly true even in a context in which the emotion is one that is expected. One such experience is the grief related to the loss of a family member. Physicians, nurses, and family members in long-term care report that they frequently have residents for whom a primary loved one, such as a spouse, has died. Questions quickly surface as to whether or not to tell the senior with dementia, how to tell the person, and how that person's response will impact the family. In two separate focus groups these questions were discussed with a group of family members and an interdisciplinary group of physicians, nurses, nurse aides, and social workers connected to long-term care facilities in one mid-sized community. Three patterns of resident response were identified. \"Self-threat\" describes situations in which the individual responds to the announcement of the death by questioning who will take care of them now; substitution refers to the individual's inability to remember who has died and substitution with a relative who died years ago; and metaphone, substitution of an object or unrelated item for the loss of a loved one. The authors suggest that persons with dementia should be told in most circumstances that their loved one has died, but that behavioral interventions need to be designed to address the confusion that this announcement can initiate. Families need to be prepared that the senior may not respond in the ways they once would have to this loss.",

      "abstract": "In a longitudinal study, infants 6-18 months of age were observed in their homes playing with their mothers and with peers. Of primary concern was how they coordinated their attention to people and objects. Observations were coded using a state-based scheme that included a state of coordinated joint engagement as well as states of person engagement, object engagement, onlooking, and passive joint engagement. All developmental trends observed were similar regardless of partner: person engagement declined with age, while coordinated joint engagement increased. Passive joint engagement, object engagement, and onlooking did not change with age. However, the absolute amount of some engagement states was affected by partner: both passive and coordinated joint engagement were much more likely when infants played with mothers. We conclude that mothers may indeed support or \"scaffold\" their infants' early attempts to embed objects in social interaction, but that as attentional capabilities develop even quite unskilled peers may be appropriate partners for the exercise of these capacities.",

Evidence suggests that only a minority of community-dwelling older people are ?severely? lonely or isolated, however a number of factors need to be considered to fully understand the extent and significance of the problem. Community- based studies have identified a variety of risk factors for loneliness/isolation including widowhood, no (surviving) children, living alone, deteriorating health, and life events (eg, loss and bereavement). Having a confidant has been identified as a protective factor for loneliness. However, evidence is often unclear or inconclusive, especially within residential settings. We identified the need to conduct more residential care-focused research; the importance of addressing a variety of methodological concerns; and the need for practitioners to develop intervention programs that are appropriately targeted, evidence-based and evaluated.",

One’s living arrangements are dynamic they change over the life course adapting to changing life circumstances. Some significant observations emerge from a cross-national comparison of living arrangements of the older population. First women in developed countries are much more likely than men to live alone as they age; older men are likely to live in family settings typically with a spouse. Secondly there has been an increase in the proportion of the older population that is living alone in developed countries. Thirdly both older men and women in developing countries usually live with adult children. Fourthly the use of non-family institutions for care of the frail elderly varies widely around the world but is relatively low everywhere. (excerpt)",

      "title": "Strengthening the Adoption Process",
      "abstract": "usually brings a lifetime of happiness to adopted children and their families. Some adoptions, however, can cause families significant problems. A recent conference on adoption research and public policy examined both the strengths and the weaknesses of adoption and provided a look at how the process might be strengthened. has long been a noble solution to a serious problem. Most adoptions, particularly those of infants, are quite successful. But behind the doors of some adoptive homes, things don't always go as smoothly as planned. Sometimes the arrival of an adopted child causes friction and disruption in the household. Adopted children are more likely than their nonadopted siblings to suffer psychological, behavioral, and academic problems. As they get older, the development of ambivalent feelings about adoption may cause additional emotional strife. Others pay an emotional price as well. Some children, usually older and with physical or emotional problems, are never adopted, instead spending childhood and adolescence moving from one foster home to another. And among the birth mothers of adopted children, a group that only recently has been studied, a significant number suffer emotional and sometimes even physical problems that can last throughout their lives. Adoption raises a whole new set of issues within families that don't exist in nonadoptive families, says Jeffrey Haugaard, an assistant professor of human development and family studies and the organizer of a day-long conference on adoption research held on campus in October. The conference was sponsored by the college's Department of Human Development and Family Studies, Bronfenbrenner Life Course Center, and Family Life Development Center. The 100 or so attendees included social workers, policy makers, judges, academics, and a number of adoptive parents. Haugaard and five other speakers discussed their research on various aspects of adoption and the influence of adoption on the different players in the adoption process. They also shared ideas of how public policy might be adjusted to strengthen the process. Examining Outcomes Richard Barth of the University of California at Berkeley described preliminary results of his longitudinal study on how the size and structure of adoptive families affect the outcomes of adoption. Although the project is far from complete, Barth is already finding that factors such as the number of adopted children in the home, the number of birth children in the home, and the age of adoptees when brought into the home can be tied to the adjustment of the adopted children. David Brodzinsky of Rutgers University described his current research on how children adjust to adoption. Earlier studies have shown that adopted children are at higher risk than birth children for a variety of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems. They have also shown that these problems appear least frequently among children who are adopted during infancy or soon after but begin to increase significantly as the age at adoption increases. Brodzinski is looking at age as well as Children's attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of adoption to determine how these factors influence, their adjustment to adoption. Special needs children - older children, sibling groups, and children with emotional or physical disabilities - are a particular challenge to adoptive families; James Rosenthal of the University of Oklahoma discussed his current work on special needs adoptions. He pointed out that earlier studies have shown that special needs adoptions are generally quite positive. His project is trying to determine the factors that make them a success. When the projects are complete, their findings may prove useful in helping adoption professionals predict the success of adoptions based on family structure and the characteristics of the adoptive children. They also may help families be aware beforehand of the special problems they may face with their adopted children. …",

      "abstract": "Societal responses to the existence of substance misuse fluctuate between harm minimisation and prohibition. Both approaches are predominantly downstream reactions to substance misuse that focus on the supply of harmful substances and the containment of misuse through treatment, rehabilitation or punishment. Until recently, little attention has been paid to the upstream individual, family, relationship, community or societal antecedents of substance misuse (which often overlap with those for other adverse life outcomes, such as unemployment, antisocial personality disorder and mental health problems) that have operated during earlier life. A growing body of evidence highlights the overlapping biological and experiential antecedents for substance abuse and other poor outcomes as well as the trajectory-changing protective factors that can prevent risks being translated into destiny. Risk minimisation and protection enhancement embedded in family and social systems are the essential building blocks of a set of early intervention strategies that begin antenatally and continue through the developing years of childhood, adolescence and young adult life, that have been shown to be effective in improving many outcomes in development, health and well-being. Much remains to be done to enable the promise of effective universal and targeted early intervention to be translated into policies, programs and practices that could be life-changing for citizens bogged in the mire of substance misuse and their children. Realistic, timely investment, influenced by the best scientific evidence indicating what works, for whom, under what circumstances, an increased degree of collaboration within and between governments and their agencies to enable \"whole of government\" responses in partnership with community-based initiatives are essential along with investments in multidisciplinary program evaluation research that will enable evidence-informed policy decisions to be tailored to the needs of individual countries.",

During breastfeeding, the baby’s various affective experiences are memorized and if there is a coherence between signals and answers (physiological and affective), the child develops a coherent internal structure. In some mother-child couples, however, a poor contingency may occur between the affective behaviour of the child and the response of the mother, which may prove to be more intrusive, angry or distant. This may lead a child to experience difficulty in understanding his own emotional states. After many repeatedly disappointing experiences within a conflictual nursing experience it may happen that at the moment of weaning the child enacts an annulment drive, producing a loss of ego integrity. It is important to stress that in determining the direction of development in a physiological or pathological sense, what counts is the interaction between that child and that mother, that is the relationship that is established between the specific child and the specific expectations and qualities of the caregiver.",

They influence their (young) children's doings by supervising their contacts with friends, monitoring where they go, and facilitating their meetings with friends at home. Adolescents' growing orientation to peers is often at the cost of direct contact with their parents. Potentially, conversations with adolescent children become significant moments for parents to collect information about their children's social lives, preparing them for the challenges of their preadult social life. We studied conversations between in state‐created family homes amongst foster parents (FPs) and out‐of‐home‐placed adolescents, to see how FPs prepare foster adolescents to deal with the dynamics of peer culture, specifically in mocking practices. We are interested in the pedagogical role of FPs in these practices. We find that peer culture behavior is expressed in the context of family homes. Rather than preparing adolescents for peer culture indirectly by discussing possible, or hypothetical, situations, FPs react directly to peer culture expressions at the dinner table. In their approach, FPs demonstrate that peer culture membership is not just an interactional competence but also a teachable issue.",

      "title": "Communicating Personal and Social Identity in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "A main developmental task for young people is to form a coherent and stable sense of personal and social identity. In fact, in adolescence (from ages 10 to 18), the multiple biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur stimulate young people to rethink about themselves, to reflect on the kind of person they want to become, and to find their own place in the society. Similarly, in emerging adulthood (from ages 19 to 29), young people have the possibility to explore a large array of alternatives in multiple life domains (e.g., education, work, relationships, worldviews) before enacting enduring adult commitments. Process-oriented identity models have been proposed to capture the dynamic process by which young people form and revise their identity over time, committing to relevant life domains, reflecting on their choices, and reconsidering them when they no longer fulfill personal aspirations and/or social expectations. This dynamic process is strongly intertwined with interpersonal and group communication processes. In fact, youth identity formation does not occur in a social vacuum; rather, young people form their identity by means of continuous interactions with significant others and relevant social groups. In particular, in youth, family, peers, and school represent main social contexts in which communication processes are likely to affect young people’s identities. Thus, communication processes are crucial for obtaining identity-relevant information that might foster individuals’ reflection on themselves and processes of social comparisons. Furthermore, through communication processes young people can manage their own reputation, striving to achieve and maintain a good reputation within relevant groups. Individuals’ efforts to enhance reputation are, indeed, important for gaining symbolic (e.g., satisfaction of esteem needs) and instrumental (e.g., the likelihood to be trusted by others and becoming influential) benefits that are important for youth psychosocial adjustment and well-being.",

It does not include the deliberate and malicious withholding of needs, which is a form of abuse. Neglect has its roots in ignorance of a child's needs and competing priorities; it is passive and usually sustained. The carer is without motive and unaware of the damage being caused. Malnutrition is a prime example of neglect; the stigma associated with the term abuse should never be applied to the poor struggling or uneducated mother whose child, that she loves dearly, becomes malnourished. Education of the mother and society and relief from the vicissitudes of poverty are required to alleviate most neglect of the world's children.",

      "title": "The Family Correlates of Maternal and Paternal Perceptions of Differential Treatment in Early Childhood",
      "abstract": "Family patterns of differential parental treatment were examined for both mothers and fathers of preschool-aged siblings in an effort to determine (I ) whether parents the younger sibling over the older sibling; (2) whether similar distributions of differential treatment emerged across the affection, control and favoritism dimensions of parenting; and (3) whether different correlates of family functioning emerged across different family constellations of differential parental treatment. Most parents reported treating their two children equally and did not favor younger children over their older siblings. In the case of differential control, mothers reported disciplining older siblings more than a younger brother or sister. Mothers' reports of differential favoritism did not parallel their reports of differential affection and control, yet there was an association between differential paternal favoritism and differential enjoyment. Congruent patterns of differential treatment (i.e., mothers and fathers showed the same pattern) were the most frequent. Optimal family functioning was not always associated with equal treatment of siblings. Key Words: differential treatment, family systems, fathers, siblings The extensive literature documenting the associations between children's behavior problems, marital conflict, and coercive parenting (see Cummings & Davies, 1994; Patterson, 1982) underscores the importance of family interaction for the young child's psychological adjustment. One of the most striking findings from recent behavioral genetic research, however, suggests that there are vast differences between siblings raised in the same family with regard to personality outcomes and psychopathology (Dunn & Plomin, 1990; Plomin & Daniels, 1987). Indeed, siblings who are raised in the same family are often as different from one another on individual outcomes as they are from children raised in different families (Plomin, Chipeur, & Neiderhiser, 1994; Plomin & Daniels, 1987). Moreover, any similarities noted between siblings with respect to psychological outcomes are believed to be genetic in origin while differences between siblings are believed to be due largely to nonshared environmental influences (i.e., those aspects of the environment experienced differently by siblings). Four possible sources of the nonshared environment are thought to account for sibling differences within families: (a) differential parental treatment (i.e., differences in how a parent treats both children); (b) differential sibling experience (i.e., the different experiences the two children provide for one another); (3) differential peer experiences (i.e., siblings have different peer groups); and (4) accidents and illnesses unique to the individual (see Plomin & Daniels, 1987). In an effort to explore the various ways that differential experiences within the family are correlated with sibling differences, several investigators have focused on differential maternal treatment. Not only do mothers respond to and control their older and younger children differently, but this difference in maternal treatment is related to more sibling antagonism and prosocial behavior in the sibling relationship (Brody, Stoneman, & Burke, 1987; Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1992a; Bryant & Crockenberg, 1980; Hetherington, 1988; Stocker, Dunn, & Plomin, 1989; Volling & Belsky, 1992), and to greater adjustment difficulties for the less favored child (Dunn, Stocker, & Plomin, 1990; McGuire, Dunn, & Plomin, 1995; Stocker, 1993, 1995). Although extensively studied, current evidence suggests that fathers also treat the older and younger child differently, and differential paternal treatment is also related to the quality of sibling interaction (Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1992a; Volling & Belsky, 1992) and sibling adjustment outcomes (Stocker, 1995). Interestingly, several studies report that both parents tend to direct more affection, control, and responsive behavior to the younger child than the older child (Brody et al. …",

Najvece dvojbe u postupcima izdvajanja djece strucnjaci vežu uz (1) roditelje koji žele pravilno brinuti o svojoj djeci (ali to iz niz razloga ne cine) (2) roditelje s kojima su djeca emocionalno bliska te (3) stvarne mogucnosti pomoci djeci u izvanobiteljskom smjestaju, u smislu nepostojanja dovoljnih tretmanskih aktivnosti u ustanovama ili kvalitetnih udomitelja. U slucajevima kada je ugrožen život djeteta odnosno djetetova dobrobit na neki krajnje opasan nacin, nema dvojbi o potrebi izdvajanja djece. U zakljucku je naglasena potreba za unapređivanjem mjere nadzora nad izvrsenjem roditeljske skrbi, stvaranjem instrumentarija za jedinstvenu procjenu resursa i rizika obitelji te supervizijom.",

      "abstract": "This study uses an interpretive narrative approach to compare and contrast assumptions regarding social integration (participation in meaningful and multiple roles, and engagement in social networks) as promoted in the Chilean Comprehensive Policy for Positive Aging, with the expectations of interviewees aged 60 to 74 years. The Policy assumes specific forms of social integration by: offering different options of social integration to dependent vs. independent older people, encouraging autonomy and self-management, and assuming the primacy of family responsibility in older people's care. Both the Policy and the interviewees emphasize the value of autonomy and independence in old age; the latter, however, do not place family at the frontline when care is needed. Understanding the matches and gaps between policy assumptions and older people's expectations for social integration, including the role of family caregiving, can open new possibilities to prevent social isolation and promote different forms of social support that are valued by older adults for their emotional and practical benefit.",

Subjects included 36 families who had been separated or divorced only once, for 6 to 30 months, and had a child between 6 and 16 years old. The custodial parent completed questionnaires regarding family functioning, single parenting, occurence and subjective evaluation of specific post-divorce events, one child's adjustment to the divorce, and parental divorce adjustment. Data were analyzes using hybrid (stepwise/hierarchical) multiple regression analyses. Sixty-three percent of families were high on the Cohesion and/or Democratic family style dimensions. These family styles were related to healthier, more supportive family relationships and clearer, more direct, communication among family members. Approximately 30 percent of families were high on the Conflict and/or Laissez-Faire family style dimensions. These latter dimensions related less to healthy family relationships and communication styles. Notably, significantly poorer child and/or parental functioning were associated to these latter families. The impact of competent custodial parenting on child and family adjustment to divorce is discussed.",

In addition, it mostly causes negative changes in the behavior of children. This research has just explored just that. The aim of the research was to determine the changes in some aspects of behavior (emotional reaction of children, their externalized and internalized behaviors, school success and behavior in teaching, relationships with others) of children of divorced parents and the importance of the role of the class teacher in the process of adaptation of the child to the divorce of their parents. The survey was conducted on a sample of teachers from different parts of Croatia. The results showed that the divorce did not cause changes in the external behavior and school success of divorced parents' children and their behavior in the classroom but is causing emotional reactions (fear), internalized behaviors, and relationships with others (withdrawal). In addition, age, gender, the presence of family violence in time and / or after divorce, the conflicting nature of the divorce, the parent with whom the child lives after the divorce, maintaining regular contacts with the parent with whom the child does not live and the quality of the teacher and parent co-operation is statistically significant, and the existence of a new parent partner with which the child lives does not prove to be a significant predictor of changes in some aspects of the behavior of divorced parents. Age and gender are important predictors of changes in the part of externelized behavior of divorced parent children, the presence of domestic violence during and / or after divorce and the maintenance of regular contacts with a parent with whom the child does not live in the part of emotional reaction and externality behavior, conflicting nature of divorce emotional response, the parent with whom the child lives in the part of school success and teaching behavior and relationships with others, and the quality of teacher and parent co-operation in the part of emotional response, outsourced behavior and school success and behavior in teaching.",

Definimos a esta vulnerabilidad comouna situación de fragilidad específica que ciertos grupos sociales experimentan a la hora de acceder a un albergue digno en un marco de vulnerabilidad social más amplio. Dicha vulnerabilidad se vincula a la intersección entre la procedencia de familias que las expulsan, condiciones económicas adversas, bajo nivel educativo alcanzado y un estigma que produce una marcación social a la identidad de génerotrans. Dicha vulnerabilidad habitacional oscila entre 1) la dificultad para acceder al alquiler formal de inmuebles por no cumplir con los requisitos (garantías, recibos de sueldo y hasta no haber hecho el cambio registral) y/o por el rechazo de las/os propietarios debido a su identidad degénero; 2) la inadmisión en hoteles y pensiones que usualmente cuentan con instalaciones precarias e, incluso, 3) vivir en situación de calle.

      "title": "Socio-psychological preconditions for the formation of preschool children group identity",
      "abstract": "The study aims to determine the socio-psychological prerequisites for forming group identity in preschool children in kindergarten on the example of interpersonal interaction of children and memories of an adult and on this basis to build a research model. Signs of group identity of children in preschool are the experience of interest in interacting with a particular group of peers, the desire to be accepted, and at the same time hostility or lack of interest in other peers. The group identity of a child is formed from the first day of his life since the child’s upbringing is focused on inclusion in the family – the first social group, on the formation of worldview, which is inherent in this social group. Kindergarten is the second crucial social environment where a child develops his group and ego-identity, not just where children are when their parents are at work. The components of group identity are the desire to be in a group, feel like a member of this group, attitude to representatives of other micro and macro groups, retransmission of parents’ social identity (for example, attitudes, etc.). The author’s questionnaire (respondents) covered the first two components of the group identity. The percentage of loneliness among peers in modern children (35.5%) and adults (27.1%) who attended kindergarten more than 30 years ago remains quite significant, which shows that this problem has existed for decades and needs more attention from scientists. Lack of play partners and frequent conflicts with peers lead to negative self-esteem, fear of communicating with children, and other toxic experiences and, consequently, risks of victimization in the future. The survey showed that the socio-psychological prerequisites for the formation of positive group identity of preschoolers are features of building children’s interaction: the development of children’s communicative skills, openness to interaction, direct interest in another child, lack of bias based on subconscious adult introjects and attitudes to support children. The other features are the involvement of the educator in the process of interaction of children: assistance in resolving conflict situations with peers, identifying children who can not build friendly relations and helping them to overcome barriers; quality feedback from the educator to the parents and vice versa; teamwork of all group staff; supervision of educators. At the same time, the preconditions also include awareness and living by the educator of their own personal children’s injuries caused by their acceptance or non-acceptance by the children’s team. Based on theoretical and empirical pilot research, the model of study of preschool children’s group identity, which contains components, preconditions of formation, criteria of formation, and success of social and psychological competence in a circle of peers, is constructed",

There are no difficulties in understanding the social situation and the ability to draw conclusions about the false beliefs of only one person (“first-order” representations). At presenile (61-74 years) and senile (75-90 years) age, there is a shortage of representations of the \"second\" order of the mental model. The phenomenon of denial of socio-cognitive changes or specific cognitive anosognosia (i.e. most people at senile age do not notice a change in understanding of fraud) is described. General predictors of the deception understanding are highlighted: socio-demographic (level of education) and psychological (symptoms of depression, solitude, satisfaction with the quality of life, subjective age) as well was age-specific predictors: changes in family, work status, cognitive functioning and polymorbidity.",

      "abstract": "The construction of a sense of home in early infancy is a complex achievement. It is intertwined throughout life with the child's pursuit of a safe physio-mental coverage. This process will be described as an interaction between: (a) a safe dwelling in the body-as-mother (constitution); (b) the internalisation of the mother-as-me (internal object space) and (c) establishing Oedipal triangular space which is responsible for the capacity to move between narcissism-as-a-home and the world-as-a-home. The construction of a home as an interplay between these elements is accompanied by distinct anxieties and unconscious phantasies. Disruptions in this early process, due to deficit, internal object relations or environmental factors, might lead to severe pathologies, mindlessness, hatred, violence and murderousness. A distinction will be made between these mental states of being-at-home, homelessness and nowhere-ness based on the corresponding levels of early development and typical anxieties. Home and homelessness are seen as more developed states of object relating accompanied by some capacity for feelings of loss, mourning and longing. Nowhere-ness, however, stems from early states of anxieties-of-being which are characterised by confusion between self and object, by nameless grief, nameless dread and devastation. The varieties of home, homelessness and nowhere-ness will be discussed with the help of clinical material taken from an analysis of a refugee child on the autistic spectrum and of his father. The role of psychoanalysis and of the psychoanalyst in promoting the creation of an internal home will be described with reference to technique.",

The extent of these additional concerns varies tremendously across families, depending upon the nature and severity of the children's disabilities and the social context in which the meaning of the children's disabilities is interpreted and acted upon. At the individual level, some children may have disabilities that affect their functioning slightly, while others may have disabilities that affect their functioning severely, across multiple areas, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. At a broader social level, some children with disabilities live in families and communities that attempt to eliminate social barriers that could result from disability, while others live in social contexts that do not strive to promote children's full participation.",

Findings indicated that all stepchildren in the sample would consider contributing some sort of care/support to their aging stepparents if necessary, but that not all stepchildren considered it their responsibility to do so. Likewise, most stepparents would expect at least some kind of care and/or support if they needed it. For stepparents this was often qualified as emotional support and certain kinds of instrumental help. In summary, the expectations of stepchildren and their stepparents are tied to four major factors: (1) family history and family ties; (2) gender; of stepchild (3) history of exchange and support; and (4) feelings of loyalty of stepchildren towards their biological parent.",

      "abstract": "While on the one hand there is much mutual love and care in the relationship between parents and their offspring, there may, on the other hand, be also much mutual 'sound and fury', which sometimes is far from 'signifying nothing' (William Shakespeare, Macbeth). Indeed, from conception on, individuals are confronted with parent-offspring conflicts of all kinds. Initially these conflicts concern physiological matters (implantation, nutrition, weaning, etc.), but later in life the accent is on psychological ('you must this', 'you must that', 'don't do that' etc.) and social affairs, and phenomena such as child abuse, infanticide and incest may occur. It is, therefore, certainly not self-evident that children honor their parents. To reinforce their position, parents (societies) may appeal to a 'divine' commandment which helps them make their children suppress any tendency to conflict toward them (and hence to their culture), so that children conform to their parents' norms and values. When such psychological and sociological parent-offspring conflicts are not resolved satisfactorily, it can be suggested, children may (consciously or unconsciously) have aggressive feelings toward their parents: Freud's 'Oedipus complex'. This complex, it is argued, can also be seen as a parent-offspring conflict. Given their biological basis, parent-offspring conflicts can hardly be considered as abnormal. Conflicts between adults and their offspring have always existed and will always exist, simply because it is inherent in our genetic make-up: parents and offspring of sexually reproducing species--humans included--are only about 50% genetically related and hence have different interests at all levels of being. Indeed, parent-offspring conflicts are such stuff as we are made on, and our little life is rounded with its consequences (adapted from William Shakespeare, The Tempest).",

      "abstract": "espanolEl autor aborda el estudio de toda una serie de conductas dependientes en la adolescencia (dependencia de drogas o alcohol, pero tambien de determinadas conductas alimentarias o de tentativas de suicidio reiteradas) que emergen en el momento en que se ha de producir el proceso de consolidacion identitaria, con toda su vertiente psiquica y fisica, en que se asienta la genitalidad y se renuncia a la bisexualidad. Considera basico para que el proceso pueda darse con garantias que la relacion con el objeto primario en los primeros tiempos haya permitido una adecuada superacion de la separacion-individuacion, asi como una buena sucesion de movimientos identificatorios. Cuando la citada relacion es fallida, el adolescente se confronta con la clinica del vacio y las conductas de dependencia le permiten intentar retomar un control activo de la situacion, siendo su objeto de dependencia mas manejable, pero llevandole a dinamicas de riesgo que pueden poner en peligro su vida, pero tambien poner en jaque y en movimiento a todo su entorno. Tales conductas pueden aparecer como una manifestacion mas de trastornos psiquiatricos mayores, pero tambien presentarse en formas dificiles de encuadrar nosotaxicamente, siendo su particular dinamica el centro de interes del presente trabajo. EnglishThe author evaluates a whole series of dependent behaviours in teenagers (drugs or alcohol dependence, but also sorne feeding conducts or repetitive autolytic attempts) which emerge in the moment where the process of self-identity consolidation takes place. This includes not only the physical but also the psychical component, that consolidates the genitality and gives up bisexuality. He considers essential for this process to se guaranteed the first relationship with the primary object, that allows a right overcome of separation-individuation, as well as a good succession of identification movements. When this relationship with the mother has failed, the adolescent has to face the emptiness clinic, and the dependent behaviours allow him or her to gain an active control of the situation. The dependency object is easier to manage, but it can lead the adolescent to risk dynamics, where he can endanger his life, but also involving all his environment. These behaviours may be considered as other manifestations of mayor psychiatnc disorders, but some other times can also be clinical forms difficult to classify. These singular situations make up the focus of the present work. francaisL' auteur realise une etude sur une serie de conduites dependantes chez l' adolescent (dependance aux drogues et a l' alcool, mais aussi sur certaines conduites alimentaires et sur les tentatives de suicide a repetiuo) qui emergent au moment ou doit apparaitre le processus de consolidation identitaire, avec toute sa charge psychique et physique, dans lequel le sujet etablit sa genitalite et renonce a la bisexualite. Pour que ce processus se mene e bien, l' auteur considere essentiel que, dans les premieres annees, la relation avec l'objet primaire ait permis un depassement reussi de la separation-individuation ainsi qu'une bonne succession des mouvements d'identification. Quand la dite relation a failli, l'adolescent est confronte a la clinique du vide et les conduites de dependance lui permettent d' essayer de reprendre un control actif de la situation car son objet de dependance est plus maniable, mais peut le conduire a des dynamiques de risque, a mettre sa vie en danger, mais aussi a maintenir en tension tout son entourage. Ces conduites peuvent apparaitre (entre autres) comme une manifestation d'un trouble psychiatrique majeur, mais aussi se presenter d'une facon difficile a classer nosotaxiquement ce qui est au centre de cette etude.",

      "title": "Non-resident fatherhood: juggling time",
      "abstract": "Fathers have important influences on their children. However, spending time with children presents a considerable hurdle for many non-resident fathers. In many countries the increasing instances of divorce, de-facto separation, non-marital childbirth and incarceration are among many factors that have led to more and more fathers not sharing the same home address with their children. This paper reports on a qualitative study of non-resident fathers’ leisure with their children. Within the study’s parameters considerable emphasis has also been given to fathers’ work and time use. The settings and context for non-resident fathers’ contact with their children are described and the methodology comprising interviews with eighteen non-resident fathers is briefly explained. The fathers who participated were a diverse group. The research reveals that several non-resident fathers who participated in the study were prepared, and able, to make substantive changes to their work (contracted time) arrangements in order to facilitate contact and engagement with their children. It is also revealed that in the absence of formal workplace arrangements, a father’s level of contact with his children may well be determined by little more than his friendship with his workplace supervisor or boss. Leisure, widely considered free time, takes many forms and is a vital, qualitative aspect of many non-resident fathers’ engagement with their children. Nevertheless, for nonresident fathers to be fully-integrated in their children’s lives they need to participate in a range of everyday activities that allow them to function as parents rather than as regular visitors. To develop and refine recent policies that support the goal of promoting fathers’ involvement in the lives of children, it is essential to understand the extent and nature of fathers’ current participation and involvement and how these are linked to the social, economic and demographic characteristics of fathers and their families.",

It is characterized by the presence of difficulties in two areas: - social communication and social interaction and - behaviour - repetitive behaviors or fixated interests. (for details see Frame 1) The combination of strengths and difficulties is unique for every child with ASD. There is a famous sentence â€žWhen you meet one person with autism, you met one person with autismâ€œ that describes the diversity of needs and challenges of persons with ASD. Some people can have a lot of difficulties in everyday challenges and some have less. That can change during the lifespan, but also can vary depending on the specific situation or setting (in school, at home, in the supermarket).",

      "title": "La construction sociale de la relation adoptive: expériences parentales de l'adoption d'enfants grands à l'international",
      "abstract": "Current tranformations in the international practice of child adoption has impacts on adoptive family construction. Adoption applicants are constrained to redefine their preparation, their expectations and criteria about the children they are willing to adopt; as those who become available for adoption are fewer, older and are likely to have increased special needs at arrival. This study explored the evolution of significant parent-child relationships outside of the ordinary (step by step) family building process; from the perspective of parents who adopted older children, internationally. As they enter their families with the prior integration of sensory, emotional, physical and social experiences elsewhere, these children push their new parents to consider new ways to establish a relationship. Therefore, adoptive families of older children move through a very different constitutionnal process that doesn't benefit from an early life start; nor do they benefit from a knowledge of their earlier histories. 20 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 adoptive parents (prospectively over the first year postadoption; and retrospectively, 2 years following). This group of participants represented 28 children adopted internationally; all have a prolonged history of institutionnal care and were adopted between 14 and 54 months of age. Findings indicate that complications of the preadoptive process can be experienced in the longer term for some parents; notably in a performance stress in the execution of the parenting role during the first year and beyond; and in response to some children's lasting difficulties. The currect construct of the 'all encompassing parent-child relationship' (parents being perceived as the main psychological builders of their child, notably, of his attachment style) has limitations that are sharply experienced by adoptive parents of older children. This construct acts as a reference point for parents, but can come to neglect the other influences on their children's development and other family or social dynamics. Practices must encourage a more equitable repartition of efforts to support these children in their new communities, and should facilitate the coordination of necessary health and psychosocial services. The overvalorization of adoptive parents as the only garanties in their children's socioemotionnal development is meeting important limits; that are shaped, among other factors, by their adverse preadoptive context. Keywords : International adoption; adoptive families; parent-child relationship; older children; family integration; adaptation.%%%%La transformation rapide de l'adoption internationale a des impacts sur la constitution des familles. Les adoptants d'enfants sont de plus en plus contraints a redefinir leur preparation, leurs attentes et leurs criteres : les enfants disponibles pour une adoption sont de moins en moins nombreux; ils sont de plus en plus âges; et leurs besoins de soins speciaux sont frequents.

It looks at how social roles determine the ‘rules of engagement’ (around communication, sharing of responsibilities) and expectations we have of one another, and how a change in one’s social role (losing a job, moving to another city, becoming partnered, ending a spousal or long-term romantic relationship, adjusting to a disabling or disfiguring medical condition, becoming a new parent) can generate a shift in or loss of one’s sense of self. It examines how these role transitions also evoke changes in one’s needs for or access to social supports and how a role change can be stressful enough to provoke an episode of major depression, especially in individuals with limited social support, insecure or disorganized attachment, or a history of or genetic vulnerability to depression.",

      "abstract": "The care of chronically ill and older adults affects families in terms of physical, emotional, relational, and social impact; the functioning of the family; and an alteration in family dynamics. This study aimed to evaluate the experiences of family caregivers of older patients in depth. A qualitative study was conducted, consisting of twenty-four narrative interviews with caregivers of chronically ill and older adults, consisting of twenty-three women and one man. The caregivers were all close relatives of the patients. The main results were as follows: (i) caregiving is predominantly performed by females; (ii) the caregiver experiences an ‘indirect’ illness; (iii) the family undergoes changes in roles, responsibilities, and relationships; (iv) support needs emerge, especially those of a social, family, work, and economic nature; and (v) resources are also activated, linked to the presence or absence of self-care. Illnesses directly impact the primary caregiver, but they also have repercussions on the entire family unit, which may activate coping strategies or lead to breakdown. It is crucial to accurately monitor the new family dynamics in order to find suitable solutions to support the family of chronically ill and older patients, underscoring the importance of work in this area.",

      "abstract": "Informal caregivers are individuals who provide care to a loved one with a health challenge such as an ageing parent or other family member with a disease that causes disabilities (i.e., a care recipient). Caregivers are in constant interaction with the care recipient. However, we still know surprisingly little about how caregivers and care recipients communicate within each other. Thus, this project aimed to explore how caregivers experience their interactions with their loved ones. Our research focused on different caregivers in terms of their relationship to the care recipient (e.g., spousal caregivers, adult children caring for older parents, caregivers of siblings, friends) and caregiving contexts (e.g., health conditions of care recipients, care tasks and intensity of care). Overall, results confirmed the crucial role of the interactions between caregivers and care recipients for the wellbeing of caregivers and their willingness to provide care. We found that caregivers who are well supported by a larger network of family and friends not only have higher wellbeing themselves, but this also benefits the care recipient. Caregivers need to be supported and acknowledged not only by their social environment (e.g., other family members and friends), but also by their care recipients. Our findings showed that caregivers feel closer to the care recipient, less burdened and more willing to care if they have supportive and collaborative interactions with the care recipient. These findings provide suggestions for psychological interventions for caregivers to promote their wellbeing and willingness to care by considering their interactions with their care recipients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The murder of a child’s mother in the context of domestic violence is a traumatic experience which results in multiple stresses affecting the child’s emotional, behavioural and educational functioning. In effect, children lose both parents – their mother as victim and their father in jail or also dead from a murder-suicide – as well as their home, neighbourhood and school as they are relocated, either with extended family members or placed into foster care. In addition, extended family members must cope with their own grief and anger as they attempt to parent these troubled children. Evidence from the papers reviewed indicate that there are no guidelines for determining who is best placed for caring for the children and for providing the safety and stability necessary for recovery, nor for ensuring the provision of therapeutic support for child survivors and their families. There is also evidence to indicate that, left untreated, effects can become long-lasting and carry on into adulthood. Policy implications are considered with a focus on multi-agency family-centred advocacy approaches.",

Research on family experiential factors during early adolescence, an important psychosocial developmental period in the life course, represents a promising line of inquiry. Using a sample of young adults in Miami-Dade County, Florida ( N = 1,267) involving longitudinal data spanning 8 years, we evaluated the importance of early adolescent family experiences (socioeconomic status, family structure, family support, family pride, parent derogation) on perceived family and friend support in young adulthood. Results indicated that early family experiences, especially negative experiences, were associated with lower perceived family and friend support in young adulthood. Moreover, these associations were independent of early childhood-adolescent behavioral disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct), psychological disorders (major depression, anxiety), substance use disorders, and lifetime social adversity. The importance of family experiences during early adolescence for later perceived social support is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The ramifications of attachment processes in adulthood at the societal level are explored, specifically, why and under what circumstances followers form attachment relationships with a leader, and how the variability in these relationships can reflect the followers' internal working models of attachment. It is argued that in crisis situations, individuals tend to form affectional bonds with (mostly charismatic) leaders that function in many respects like an attachment relationship between a child and a parent. Relations between individuals and various social institutions, such as community or state, are likewise portrayed as involving attachment dynamics. The provision of security and protection (the safe haven and the secure base functions) by social structures, institutions, and leaders is seen as needed because of the inherent perceived imperfection and fallibility of \"regular\" attachment figures in adulthood (e.g., parents, friends, and romantic partners). This reliance on leaders and social institutions is seen as reflecting the normative diversification in attachment dynamics that takes place with development. Cultural and individual variations in these processes are also considered.",

A variety of behaviour ranging from a complete refusal to participate in domestic activity to an equal division of household tasks is demonstrated.

The woman's right to persue a career was recognized mainly by men in middle to upper social class in the 25-30 age group who participate in household duties. It is evident that, even in the case of domestic collaboration, women have the ultimate responsibility for household tasks. In that men tend to choose the more gratifying duties (es. cooking, child care).",

      "abstract": "Family is defined, among other things, as “a spiritual union of a small group of people gathered in a common hearth through acts of mutual assistance and care, based on belief in real or presumed biological connection, family and social tradition”. Educational psychology perceives the family from the point of view of the child’s interests as its natural educational environment. The relationship between parents has a significant impact on the emotions that parents direct towards their children. Minors analyze every behavior of their parents; sometimes they imitate them, repeating adults’ words or gestures, other times they deny the parent’s behavior and avoid contact with him. Parents’ attitude towards minor children shapes their future and may generate repeated negative and positive behavior patterns. In court proceedings, one can notice an increased tendency to downplay the father’s role in the process of raising the child or to deny the mother’s overprotective attitude towards the child. Neither of the parents is “indebted to each other” and is guided by the principle of positive self-presentation before the court while depressing the attitude of the other parent.",

      "title": "Assuming Elder Care Responsibility: Am I a Caregiver?",
      "abstract": "Caregivers of the elderly face conflicting legal demands; they must make certain the elder's needs are being met while not forcing undesired care on an adult capable of informed decisions. This dichotomy may be a reason a large number of reported elder abuse derives from unintentional neglect on behalf of informal familial caregivers. The current research examines this possibility with exploratory interviews and an experiment. The interviews between elders and their family (30 dyads) revealed that many did not intend for the living arrangements to become permanent and the nonelders were largely unprepared for the magnitude of changes and responsibilities that would result. The elders often expressed a sense of loss for their former life and feeling supernumerary in the family. In the experiment, we examined whether a person recognizes when a care‐giving relationship exists and the factors that contribute to notions of being a caregiver. Results suggest that potential caregivers (124 community members) focus on the relationship with the elder more than the elder's physical and financial needs, and generally have stronger feelings of moral responsibility rather than legal responsibility to provide care.",

Adoptee alcoholism did not correlate with any other diagnosis in a biological parent. Childhood socialized conduct disorder was significantly higher in those adoptees who later received a diagnosis of alcoholism or suspected alcoholism, and was positively, but not significantly, related to heavy drinking or alcoholism in parents. Age of adoptee, time spent in foster care, age of biological mother at the time of the birth, socio-economic status of adoptive home, psychopathology other than alcoholism in the biological background, and psychiatric or behavioural problems in the adoptive family (parents or sibs) were all unrelated to adult alcoholism in the adoptee.",

      "title": "Toward a Sociology of Toys: Inanimate Objects, Socialization, and the Demography of the Doll World",
      "abstract": "ALMOST from the moment of birth and for many years thereafter, children are in frequent and intense contact with toys in great variety, of diverse type, complexity, and composition. These toys are, from a very early age, an important part of the child's experientially perceived reality, operating in several related ways over and above their more manifest recreational purpose.' For example, they function as socializing mechanisms, as educational devices, and as scaled down versions of the realities of the larger adult-dominated social world.2 Furthermore, some toys are also companions to their child-masters. The pathetic fallacy 3 seems a misnomer when applied to the personification of a doll, a stuffed animal, or the like, by its child possessor. It does not take precise observational techniques to become aware of the relationship which such toys bear to the children who both personify and care for them. The fastidiously groomed doll, the conscientiously tended teddy bear, the earnestly and tenderly nursed patient are not exceptions but standard operational procedures for children implicated in these intimate, toy-populated worlds. They make up social milieux in which, unlike the everyday world of adults, the actors are inanimate toys rather than persons; but, like persons, such toys have identities imputed or assigned to them through a social process.4",

      "abstract": "Today, the Spanish Legal System recognizes the full ownership of the  rights of minors and their evolving capacities to exercise them according to their degree of maturity, recognizing that its acquisition is a developmental process. Currently the issue of informed consent is  perhaps one of the more complex and debated and also one that concern  more to clinicians. It is based on respect for self-determination and autonomy of those children or adolescents with sufficient discernment  capacity and taking into account the right to make decisions about facts  that can affect their health. The main difficulty with the doctrine of “mature minor” is the assessment of the maturity or capacity to make decisions,  due to the lack of guidelines or validated procedures. This paper reviews the main ethical and legal criteria and discusses some especially problematic situations such as: (1) Intervention with children whose parents are in a situation of marital separation or divorce, (2) parents who make an unlawful exercise of parental authority, (3) irreconcilable conflicts between the decision of the child and their parents or (4) when the minor’s decision is against their own interests.",

These behaviors occur not only among children or adolescents but also in daily interactions, including among the elderly. In nursing homes, for example, bullying persists despite the physical limitations that aging brings. This study aims to explore the impact and the underlying factors that contribute to seniority and bullying behaviors among older people. A qualitative approach was used, employing the photo-elicitation technique, with two participants who met the selection criteria. The results of the study indicate that seniority and bullying behaviors among older people are influenced by early character development, particularly by authoritarian parenting styles, as well as the social conditions that create bullying victims. The consequences of these behaviors include social sanctions, such as being ostracized from interaction with other residents.",

Because of the specificity of the triadic situation in which twins acquire language, we wanted to analyze family interactions in order to identify situations that could facilitate the child's speech and be worked on in the context of a parental guidance. Video recordings were made at the home of one family of twins aged 6;2, in different situations: a family meal, a picture book reading, and a play time. Our analyses focused on one of the twins diagnosed with a speech and language delay. The child produced more and longer utterances in the picture book reading. This situation is also the situation where the rhythm of the interaction is slower, the child was most spoken to, with more open questions, and errors (in particular lexical errors) were almost all repaired by the adult (all repairs being in turn taken up by the child). The family meal is the situation where the child spoke the least and produced the shortest utterances; in this situation, although central in the child's everyday life and for his social and linguistic development, the child was rarely spoken to, questions were mostly closed, and errors less taken up.",

      "abstract": "Os professores e terapeutas da area da saude, por diversas razoes, chegam descrentes, sem saber o que ou como fazer, a fim de que seus clientes sejam participativos e respeitem as normas em ambientes de clinica e de escola. Haja vista que, os transtornos de conduta sao um dos mais frequentes problemas relatados em escolas e clinica infantil e pode ser resultado, frequentemente, de uma longa sequencia de interacao aversiva entre terapeutas, educadores e criancas, com a possibilidade de culminar em abuso fisico. O transtorno de conduta implica em padrao repetitivo e persistente de conduta, em que os direitos basicos dos outros ou regras e normas sociais apropriadas a idade sao violados. Os comportamentos pro-sociais e desviantes podem ser subproduto direto de intercâmbios sociais, especialmente com membros da familia e outros pares. Tais comportamentos ocorrem diante de um estimulo discriminativo observavel no ambiente social imediato e mantido por consequencias reforcadoras ou punitivas. Aumentar a participacao efetiva e motivadora dos educandos e clientes parece ser necessario para o desenvolvimento social, cognitivo e afetivo, dentre outros. Ensinar implica na generalizacao de habilidades e conceitos ensinados e pode ser um criterio importante para avaliacao da efetividade do aprendizado. O presente estudo propoe o aumento de repertorios comportamentais individuais de graduandos de Pedagogia e Fonoaudiologia a partir da identificacao de habilidades de manejo de comportamento dos mesmos. Os participantes foram os clientes com transtorno de comportamento em distintos contextos do atendimento no Centro de Estudos da Educacao e da Saude –CEES -FFC – UNESP – Marilia/SP, e graduandos em estagio supervisionado na area de Fonoaudiologia e Pedagogia.  As observacoes da interacao de cada diade foram conduzidas em diferentes situacoes no CEES. Estas observacoes consistiram de situacao de linha de base, treino, incluindo de generalizacao e follow up . As estrategias para o ensino das competencias sociais para os estagiarios consistiam de Instrucoes Verbais e Ensaio Comportamental (IVEC) e Ensino em Situacao Natural com Modelo (ESM). Utilizou-se o delineamento de linha de base com multiplas provas, com diferentes participantes e envolvendo o mesmo comportamento. Nas sessoes, apos a linha de base observou-se que as estagiarias continuaram a usar as competencias sociais que envolveram as habilidades de manejo de comportamento e quais as respostas foram mantidas durante as sessoes de intervencao e follow up.",

      "title": "Expanding Rehabilitation Services to Meet the Legal Needs of Aging Americans. (Legal Issues in Aging)",
      "abstract": "As one moves from adulthood into old age, a myriad of transitions must be made. On the positive side, many people either retire from work or begin to significantly reduce the amount of time spent in employment activities. Some will downsize their place of residence by purchasing a smaller home, moving into a retirement community or in some instances, moving in with their children. Others may begin a second career, perhaps turning a hobby into a profit making business, and still others may be financially secure enough to travel, purchase their dream home or return to school. For some, however, the transition into old age will be filled with concerns regarding healthcare maintenance, financial instability, health and life insurance coverage, and long-term care needs. The majority of adults facing these concerns will do so as a result of the ill effects of the aging process, physical/mental illness, or disability that has impacted or will impact their ability to perform a major life function, such as self care or other activities of daily living sorely compromising their independence. In these instances, the person with the disability and/or his family will be faced with a host of choices regarding future care and well being. Fortunately legal vehicles are available, and in some instances necessary, to assist in decision-making, healthcare planning, and resource management of the affected individual. This article examines ways in which rehabilitation counselors in private and forensic practices are meeting the needs of aging Americans. Although work with aging clients in legal venues is an area of rehabilitation practice that has been emerging for some time, it remains unfamiliar to a large portion of the rehabilitation community. Consequently, an explanation of the legal terms and concepts discussed throughout this article will be provided to help further the reader's understanding of these complex issues. Definition of Terms Grantor--the person signing a power of attorney or other legal document which gives power or authority to another. Grantee--the person that would exercise the powers or authority given by the grantor. Power of Attorney--a document which gives a person the right to make binding decisions for another, as an agent. A power of attorney may be specific, applying to a certain type of decision; or general, in that the agent makes all major decisions. Durable Power of Attorney--a type of power of attorney that is often limited in the kinds of powers that can be assigned. Unlike an ordinary power of attorney, durable powers can survive for long periods of time and can continue after incompetency is established. Healthcare Power of Attorney/Healthcare Surrogate--a document that allows someone to make medical decisions for another person if they cannot make them for themselves. This person has broad power to act on another's behalf, including the right to make decisions regarding life-support. Pooled Trust--a trust fund that contains the assets of disabled individuals and is established and managed by a non-profit association. Separate accounts must be maintained for each trust beneficiary, although these accounts may be pooled for purposes of managing and investing the trust funds. The funds are solely for the individuals' health, welfare and benefit (The Florida Pooled Trust, 1999). Special Needs Trust, aka Payback Trust--is an irrevocable trust with the following requirements: (1) must be funded with assets of the individual; (2) the individual must be under 65 years of age at the time the trust is funded; (3) the individual must be disabled; (4) the trust must be established by a parent, grandparent or legal guardian of the individual; (5) any state which paid medical assistance on behalf of the individual must be reimbursed from any funds remaining in the trust upon the death of the individual; and (6) reimbursement must be up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual. …",

Fathers of both high-risk and normal infants engaged in more game playing and laughed more frequently than mothers during interactions.

Working-class parents are more likely to respond in terms of the immediate consequences of the child's actions, middle-class parents in terms of their interpretation of the child's intent in acting as he does. This reflects differences in parents' values: Working-class parents value for their children qualities that assure respectability; desirable behavior consists essentially of not violating proscriptions. Middle-class parents value the child's development of internalized standards of conduct; desirable behavior consists essentially of acting according to the dictates of one's own principles. The first necessarily focuses on the act itself, the second on the actor's intent.",

Health-risk behaviours have been the traditional targets of intervention. Interventions need to be situated within broader policy action on multiple disadvantages that are especially troublesome, operating at the structural level in society, influencing institutions and patterning interpersonal and inter-group relations. Action on social determinants needs cross-sector agreement and commitment to operate in harmony, flexibly, tenaciously, and retaining the capacity to adapt to new contexts and sources of disadvantage. Applying such interventions early in the life course, in youth, and to parents will prevent the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. Structural sources of poor health must be tackled, hence the importance of action to militate against the social determinants of poor health.",

Among these factors, the role of the family is still a relatively underexplored issue. This chapter investigates the role played by the family context in supporting or hampering the full participation of persons with disabilities in society through the analysis of life-course interviews. The social framework of the family is often co-responsible for the potential stigmatisation of the child with disabilities. The salience of the family in influencing the life courses of children with disabilities is not constant across cohorts and countries. The complexity of the family as a system and the complexity of the relations and interactions between the family and the person with disabilities do not permit a reliance on the family as an automatic transmission belt for policies.",

      "abstract": "La plupart des recherches qui etudient la communication sociale entre jeunes enfants utilisent des situations dans lesquelles au moins un adulte est present. Pourtant, peu d'etudes ont evalue l'influence de cette presence sur les comportements sociaux des enfants. Notre hypothese etait que la presence d'un adulte modifie le developpe ment de la communication entre enfants, et de differemment selon l'age : stimulante pour les plus jeunes, elle serait un frein pour les plus ages. Cette hypothese a ete examines systematiquement en comparant les memes groupes d'enfants dans deux conditions : avec et sans adulte. 99 enfants familiers, de 19-36 mois, reparts en triades ont ete reunis dans une salle familiere de leur creche et filmes par une camera invisible, durant 20 minutes, lamoitie en presence d'un adulte familier, et la moitie en son absence. L'ordre de presence absence a ete contrebalance. Les resultats montrent que, quand l'adulte estpresent, il est un objet d'attention sociale en competition avec l'attention porte aux pairs : le contacts sociaux, les reponses verbales et les riires sont moins nombreux. La conclusion est que, meme neutre, l'adulte n'est pas oublie et constitu une partie effective du systeme social.",

      "title": "Do birds of a feather leave the nest together? The role of sibling personality similarity in the transition to adulthood",
      "abstract": "Empirical evidences on intragenerational transmission of life course have been demonstrated and that interpersonal similarity may moderate the effect. In particular, siblings who are more similar in their demographic characteristics are more likely to follow each other’s life course transitions. Focusing on parental home-leaving and building upon the social influence processes and similarity-attraction effects, this study investigates whether the association between siblings’ departures from the parental home increases when they are similar in the Big Five personality traits, like similarity in demographic traits. We use 28 waves of a longitudinal sample from “Understanding Society: The U.K. Household Longitudinal Study”. The results of the multilevel discrete-time event-history analysis ( N = 3,717 children) indicate that the association between leaving of a sibling and oneself was strengthened when they had a similar level of extraversion, particularly when they were both introverts. This implies that although introverted adolescents and emerging adults might take less initiative regarding social relationships and be more hesitant in their transition to adulthood, when a similarly introverted sibling makes such a transition, they are more inclined to do so. To conclude, the study uncovers the relationship between siblings’ personality similarity and their resemblance in nest-leaving, which helps explain young adults’ home-leaving decision in an era when delayed leaving is observed.",

We use the Health and Retirement Study (2004–2018) and discrete-time event history analysis to assess the odds of institutionalization or death over a 14-year period among older adults with limitations in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs; e.g., bathing). We consider caregiving arrangements as conventional (i.e., spouse or adult child), unconventional (e.g., extended family, employee, friend), or self-directed (i.e., no caregiver). We find a “care paradox” in that self-directing one’s own care was associated with a lower risk of institutionalization or death compared with having conventional care (spouse/adult caregiver) and unconventional care (employee). Relative to conventional care, having an employee caregiver was associated with increased risk of institutionalization. Findings are still observed when controlling for level of impairment and various health-related factors. More research is needed to understand older adults who self-direct their own care.",

In the first case, a young man killed first his father and then, after an interval of 10 years, his mother. In the second case, the mother and grandmother of a child aged 15 had prevented virtually all contact with the outside world (school, friends, outside activities of any kind) over a period of 10 years. These cases illustrate that expert evaluation should not be limited to an individual (evaluation of diagnosis and of criminal responsibility) but should be linked to an assessment of the functioning of the entire family group and to the psychopathology of other family members.",

      "title": "Teenage Parents and Their Offspring",
      "abstract": "Teenage parents are cast into adult roles before the role experimentation and identity development tasks of middle adolescence can be completed. Understanding the etiology of this social problem requires an ecological perspective encompassing individual characteristics, person-context variables, and societal factors such as race and social class. Risk factors identified in the literature on adolescent pregnancy in the US include: absence of a future orientation or aspirations, lack of assertiveness and interpersonal skills to control physical intimacy, low socioeconomic status and minority group membership, growing up in a single-parent family, a history of sexual abuse, five or more siblings, a sister or friend who became a teenage mother, lax parental supervision of dating and free time, low self-esteem, and dropping out or failing in school. The limited data on adolescent fathers suggest they have histories of substance use, delinquency, failure to graduate from high school, financial difficulty, and exposure to family violence. The offspring of adolescent parents show a higher incidence of developmental delays and mild mental retardation than children of adults and are at increased risk of child abuse and neglect. Teen parents raised in dysfunctional families tend to perpetuate destructive methods of child rearing and have unrealistic, age-inappropriate expectations for infants and toddlers. Teenage parents' lack of competence can be mitigated, however, by positive living arrangements, a supportive family of origin, peer support groups, quality child care, school-based services, and accurate information about parenting and child development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The life-course perspective’s emphasis on “linked lives” highlights the importance of positive parent-child relationships for adults’ well-being in mid-life and beyond. However, one in ten Americans experiences parent-child estrangement, defined as ending all contact and communication for a period of time. Despite the prevalence, the reasons underlying family estrangements are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews with 43 middle-aged and older adults (age range = 46-81, M = 65.05 years) who are or were estranged from an adult child (estrangement range = 1-26, mean = 6.53 years). On the basis of a jointly developed codebook, independent coding from the first and second author revealed 22 estrangement reasons across eight categories, with parents citing reasons from across four categories on average. Estrangement was most often attributed to the behavior, issues, or traits of the child (79%), problems surrounding a difficult in-law/ partner (72%), or disagreements about beliefs and values (67%). To a lesser degree, estrangements were linked to separation or divorce (49%), financial problems and conflicts (42%), adverse childhood experiences of the estranged child (30%), and interference from someone other than a partner (16%). More than half of the parents (58%) also endorsed other reasons, including their own traits and behaviors, communication issues, a family history of estrangement, and passive loss of contact. Older parent–adult child estrangements are perceived as multi-causal, with four out of five parents describing the estranged child as difficult or troubled. Implications of the findings for professionals working with older adults are discussed.",

Inses disebabkan karena faktor internal (biologis, psikologis) dan faktor eksternal (ekonomi keluarga, tingkat pendidikan dan pengetahuan rendah, serta tingkat pemahaman agama,  penerapan kaidah, dan norma agama yang tidak diketahui), serta konflik budaya karena perkembangan teknologi, kemiskinan, dan pengangguran. Dampak yang ditimbulkan oleh inses antara lain gangguan psikologis, secara medis anak hasil hubungan inses berpotensi besar mengalami kecacatan, korban sering disalahkan dan mendapat stigma buruk, sampai dewasa anak korban inses biasanya akan memiliki rasa harga diri rendah, depresi, memendam perasaan bersalah, sulit mempercayai orang lain, terjerumus ke dalam perilaku negatif, dan sulit membangun hubungan dengan  orang lain. Pencegahan dapat dilakukan melalui beberapa tahap, pertama: memberikan pelayanan terpadu pada populasi umum secara objektif yang merupakan target untuk mencegah segala kemungkinan terjadinya perkosaan, dalam hal ini kekerasan seksual dalam inses. Kedua: memberikan pelayanan terpadu pada kelompok-kelompok rentan yang menjadi target untuk mencegah keberlanjutan permasalahan inses. Ketiga: memberikan pelayanan terpadu kepada pelaku serta korban inses yang sudah diketahui, untuk mencegah insiden baru terjadi antara pelaku dan korban yang sudah diketahui perbuatannya. Di samping itu, perlu memperkuat keimanan dengan menjalankan ajaran agama secara benar, memperkuat rasa empati, mengisi waktu luang dengan kegiatan kreatif-positif, menjauhkan diri dari hal-hal yang dapat membangkitkan syahwat, memberikan pengawasan dan bimbingan terhadap anggota keluarga sehingga dapat terkontrol, dan memberikan pendidikan seks sejak dini.",

Data from comparable surveys of owners of tourism and hospitality businesses in Denmark and Canada reveal a very low rate of inheritance and a number of industry-specific barriers, including those related to location (e.g., remoteness and small-town settings result in out-migration by children who do not share their parents' lifestyle goals); nature of the work (long hours, high contact with customers, and hands-on labor make the business unappealing); viability of the business (seasonality of demand, taxes, or inseparability of business and family assets result in low potential for inheritance); and the lifestage of parents and children (many owners are in a second career or preretirement enterprise, and children cannot become involved). A number of hypotheses arise from this research and a framework for examining generic and industry-specific barriers is presented, with commentary on how other industries could be examined for these barriers.",

      "title": "School Effects of Attachment Break in Context of Economic Migration of Parents",
      "abstract": "Romania is going through a period of economic transition, subject to the pressures of globalization that affect the evolution of the family, at the micro social level, structurally, from the behaviour and relational point of view. The continuous process of changes in the labour market, the inefficiency of the association between vocational training and job satisfaction, the financial difficulties felt by most families but also the challenge of modernity have emphasized the phenomenon of migration in the last decade. The departure of parents who have to work abroad has become a worrying phenomenon with a higher incidence in the eastern half of the country. It has got complex effects on the evolution of the family, especially on the children left at home with one of their parents or their tutors. Nowadays, the studies show more and more situations of neglect in which children become victims and suffer emotionally and physically. They also suffer various abuses, they are exploited through work or sex. In schools, there is a new profile of special educational requirements (not deficiencies), the profile of children left at home without parental support. It is worrying the migration phenomenon seen as a value model by the young generation and its negative effects at school level: decrease of motivation for learning or school abandonment. The present study discusses a review of the current scientific literature objectively, which examines the impact of breaking attachment relationships between children and parents on socio-emotional development and school outcomes. The Romanian society knows an important socio-economic phenomenon, which has grown since 1990: migration. In 2017, a study carried out at the request of the Romanian Government recorded more than 85,000 children left home alone with one of the parents or without parental supervision. We aim to analyse what effects at school and socio-emotional level have the loss of attachment ties having as moderators the gender of the migrant parent, the duration of the separation, the age at which the separation occurs. When these relationships are interrupted, the childâ€™s emotional development is affected, his emotional balance having repercussions in his social life. The purpose of this study is to identify, monitor the dimensions of the phenomenon in intensely affected areas (Braila and Galati counties), the psycho-pedagogical aspects of children with migrant parents exposed to situations of vulnerability, marginalization and to propose a program of educational strategies in order to optimize school motivation. The main objective of the research is to identify, evaluate and involve them into adaptive actions that have as their objective the rebalancing of the socio-affective relations.",

Regardless of the coping style adopted, the evidence suggests that internalising and externalising behaviours in childhood present detectable clues to a child's distress that may differ at different stages of development. A number of the participants reported persistent fears over losing their own children to local authority care if professional services became aware of the violence in their own relationships. From an early age, children were being inculcated into believing that adults had a means to know what children were thinking and doing, and in some cases, participants reported that their parent/s were actively forbidding them to tell anyone about what was happening at home or there would be serious consequences.",

      "abstract": "At the close of the twentieth century in the United States of America, the greatest threat to healthy development that very young children experience may arise from failures in their relationships with adult caregivers. Several decades of research strongly suggest that children need \"at least one person who is crazy about them\" in order to make full use of their own gifts, explore what the world has to offer, and overcome the vicissitudes that life will throw in their way. Large numbers of babies and toddlers in this country do not form stable, nurturing relationships with their parents. Many very young children experience disruption and loss-sometimes repeatedly-in their relationships with important caregivers during the earliest years of life. Separation and bereavement are hardly new in human history, but during the past half-century transformations in many domains of economic and family life have profoundly altered both the quality and the quantity of children's experiences with adults in their earliest years. We can still only guess what effects these changes are having on the development of particular groups of children or upon whole generations of citizens.",

Parents in families with stepsibling subsystems felt closer to their biological children than parents who did not have stepchildren. They also felt stepchildren negatively affected their relationship with their biological children. When stepsibling subsystems are present, parents more often discipline only their biological children. When stepsibling subsystems are not present the stepparent is more likely to be perceived as playing a parental role, including disciplining the stepchildren. In general, adults in stepfamilies have more difficulty than do children coping with stepsibling subsystems. In the absence of stepsibling subsystems, the tendency is to incorporate the nuclear family model.",

      "title": "Childhood Development of Shared Reality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Something almost magical happens to children three to five years of age, even years before they begin school. They recognize that their significant others, such as mommy and daddy, have expectations and aspirations about who they should be and want them to be—not just now but in the future. These are goals and standards that the significant others have for their child—guidelines for their child. And the good news for the caretakers is that the children typically accept these guidelines as their own goals and standards: They become shared self-guides. These shared self-guides become the basis of the child’s self-regulation and are followed without the need for surveillance. This is the upside. The downside is that children suffer when they fail to meet the shared self-guides—human vulnerability to emotional problems. The next phase of shared reality emerges when schooling begins. It is no longer enough to follow the guidelines of your significant others for you as an individual. You must now embrace roles that transcend you as an individual (i.e., apply to everyone in that role) and must be coordinated with other roles within a system of roles—shared coordinated roles. You cannot just pay attention to what you do. You must keep in mind what others are doing and coordinate with them—but in your role with their role and not person to person. This is necessary for cultural organizations to work, but it undermines feeling special and unique. It is the end of childhood.",

The chapter addresses the intersecting dimensions of structural and communicative openness, with attention to how they change over time. It outlines a typology of contact dynamics over time, such that couples were classified as embodying one of these patterns: (a) low enthusiasm for openness maintained, little contact; (b) increasing enthusiasm for openness, some contact; (c) increasing enthusiasm for openness, little contact; (d) high enthusiasm for openness maintained, some contact; (e) high enthusiasm for openness maintained, no contact; (f) decreasing enthusiasm for openness amid boundary challenges, contact terminated or reduced; and (g) enthusiasm for openness maintained amid boundary challenges, contact maintained.",

      "title": "ORPHANHOOD IN UKRAINE AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON: HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL ASPECTS",
      "abstract": "Successful socialization of orphans is one of the vital social problems of modern Ukraine, which is complicated by the permanent demographic crisis. The crisis of morality, economic instability, changes in the worldview, and many other factors have reduced the socializing function of the family and this, in turn, has provoked an increase in the number of orphans. Additionally, in the future, the orphan issue may turn into a problem for sustainable socio-political development of the state, because such children often violate the adaptation to the norms and rules of society, since they do not identify themselves with it. As psychologists point out, raising children in state institutions (boarding schools, social centres, etc.) forms in them a specific, often maladaptive, attitude to life, which is significantly different from children who grew up in families, even incomplete ones. Children who were brought up in orphanages and boarding schools socialize much worse, it is difficult for them to resolve conflicts of communicating with the environment, they have more primitive forms of communication and are unable to refrain from aggression, blaming others for the conflict, etc. Such children demonstrate typical manifestations of defensive behavior in conflicts, indifference, and lack of independence. The paper aims to study the problem of orphans and unwanted children in historical retrospect, showing that this problem was acute throughout the entire historical development of Ukraine, and proving that a successful solution to this problem can positively affect the socio-political development of the state and ensure social stability as a whole. Education and protection of the younger generation has always been an important area of government policy because children are a kind of guarantor of self-preservation and stable progress of the nation. The state, taking care of the development of this category of children, not only ensures further economic stability but also prepares future citizens with an active life position, able to take a conscious part in the management of state and public affairs, to form an effective civil society. The increase in the number of children who are now becoming orphans is evidence that a large number of families are not able to qualitatively adapt to the new socio-economic and socio-cultural living conditions. The reasons leading to the increase in the number of orphans are mostly related to changes in social and family values, and not to the economic factor. Despite all the efforts of the authorities, by the end of 2021, the social protection system for children of Ukraine did not record a significant decrease in the number of orphans and orphanages. The existing mechanisms for providing social services to families in difficult life circumstances cannot currently be called sufficiently effective, and they need to be refined, especially in modern conditions of war. It is obvious that the adaptation of international experience and the borrowing of the practices of the developed countries of the world to solve the problem, in general, contributed to the development of domestic legislation, but as often happens, in practice they do not have the same effect. A lot has already been done, but there is still a lot of work to be done on the formation and use of a qualitatively new system of social standards and guarantees of protection for orphans and unwanted children. Children are the most promising part of the population for the development of the country, for which it is necessary to ensure safety and development in their native country. Currently, Ukraine faces a difficult and multi-vector task of revising world values and forming humanistic world standards of living standards. A responsible attitude towards family and parenthood must be formed at different levels, both at the national level and at the level of the educational institution, the team, the family, and the individual. Key words: orphans, children deprived of parental care, unwanted children, political and social development, state.",

      "title": "Legitimate voices: Teen mothers and education",
      "abstract": "The dominant discourses and stereotypical images surrounding the teenage mother cast her, overwhelmingly, in a negative light. She is a social, and (although to a lesser extent in contemporary society) a moral problem. The wrong-girl discourse is a powerful one, and shapes the dominant view of the teenage mother as having made bad (and wrong) choices. It seeks to shame and blame the young mother for her predicament. It is also within this discursive framework that stereotypes abound: teenage mother as school drop out; as irresponsible; as stupid slut. Psychological traits are attributed to the teenage mother, which often cast her into an infantilised role, unable to make her own (responsible) decisions. According to this view of the teenage mother solutions need to be found to remedy her mistake. Some see the solution as the removal of all welfare benefits in an effort to make teenage parenting less attractive, while others call for a re-stigmatisation of teenage mothers. In terms of education, there are those who believe that teenage mothers must continue to follow the normal life trajectory through adolescence, which means completing secondary education at the same time\r\nas her non-parenting peers, and then find employment in order to best provide for her family. Many barriers stand in the way for young mothers re-entering the adolescent world of secondary education, especially when school environments aren't supportive of the teenage mother. Despite this, and despite the negative view of teenage mothers, this narrative life history study sought to give voice, through the telling of their stories, to seven Tasmanian women who had given birth as teenagers and who had subverted the stereotype of high school drop out by re-engaging with education. This study complements earlier investigations by legitimising the voices of a select sample of young mothers in an effort to examine their view of the realities of their lives within the context of negative societal views, a mutual obligation welfare framework, and largely unsupportive school environments. There are implications of this study for educators and educational policy makers in Tasmania, the state with the second highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Australia.",

We compared agreements reached by families identified as having or not having a history of intimate partner violence (IPV) on a variety of issues hypothesized to be related to risk of future interparental contact and conflict and thus violence. Families with and without a history of IPV did not make significantly different legal or physical custody or parenting‐time arrangements. Nor did these groups differ in specifying the details of how to handle some issues that could lead to future conflict (e.g., making up missed parenting time). They also did not differ in the likelihood of agreeing to supervised visitation or exchanges of children in public places. However, agreements of families with a history of IPV were more likely to include safety restrictions (e.g., restrictions on interparental fighting, physical discipline of children, substance use) and counseling referrals. We discuss implications of the study findings in the context of the debate surrounding mediation with families who have experienced IPV. Key Points for Family Court Community: The appropriateness of mediation with families exhibiting a history of IPV is a focal point of debate in family law. This work compares the content of mediation agreements reached by families with and without a history of IPV in a law school community clinic.",

Relying on data on approximately 6,400 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort, analyses assessed the role of mother’s age at migration on children’s social development in the United States (sociability and problem behaviors). Consistent with models of divergent adaptation and assimilation, the relation between age at arrival and children’s social development is not linear. Parenting practices, observed when children were approximately 24 months of age, partially mediated the relation between mother’s age at arrival and children’s social development reported at approximate age 48 months, particularly in the case of mothers who arrived as adults.",

In hazardous environments where child outcomes are unpredictable, unresponsive parenting could be adaptive. Child development associated with parenting practices, in turn, may influence cultural patterns related to insecurity and aggression (which we call the “risk‐response model”). We test these propositions in a cross‐cultural analysis. The Standard Cross‐Cultural Sample (SCCS) includes indicators of parental responsiveness: father–infant sleeping proximity, father involvement, parental response to infant crying, and breastfeeding duration (age at weaning). Unresponsive parenting was associated with cultural models including greater acceptance of extramarital sex, aggression, theft, and witchcraft. Socialization practices in later childhood were not better predictors of the outcomes than was earlier parenting. We conclude that some cultural adaptations appear rooted in parenting practices that affect child development.",

      "abstract": "The fact that the circumstances of single-parent families are significantly less favourable than those of couple families is widely documented in the literature. However, two aspects of this phenomenon remain little explored: firstly, the extent to which the absence of the second parent in the household is responsible for these circumstances; and secondly, the fact that mothers in different life situations separate from their partners and enter into new partnerships after phases of single parenting with different degrees of frequency. In the present paper, these transitions are examined using multivariate analyses based on the Socio-Economic Panel. There is a strongly negative correlation between household income and mothers changing from a couple family to single parenting. Such separations occur particularly frequently if the family has previously received long-term unemployment benefits or social assistance. This applies even when other aspects of mothers' life situations - such as their educational level - are controlled for. On the other hand, mothers who are first-generation immigrants and mothers with larger families are particularly unlikely to switch to single parenting. Single mothers are more likely to enter into a new partnership in a joint household if they are averse to risk and their youngest child is under three years of age. Overall, the results suggest that the life situations of single parents have their roots in the time before the change of family status. The consequence for family policy is that in endeavouring to improve the lot of single parents it should take account not only of the effects of being without a partner but also of quite separate problem areas, such as a lack of job qualifications.",

      "title": "Adoption and the Care of Children: The British and American Experience",
      "abstract": "Adoption is out of favour. Numbers have fallen dramatically, and baby adoptions have become rare events. Recent trends in family law make it increasingly unlikely that children will ever be declared free to be adopted, while would-be adopters are discouraged by a series of obstacles and abjections. Consequently children who are unable to live with their natural parents are likely to spend long periods - possibly their entire childhoods - 'in care'. This can entail years of to-ing and fro-ing between children's homes, foster parents, and repeated attempts to re-unite them with neglectful and often abusive parents. The results for the children concerned are extremely poor, and all the evidence suggests that the state makes a very bad substitute parent. Children who have spent time 'in care' are more prone to psychiatric disorders, they suffer in terms of education and health, and they often 'graduate' from the system to homelessness, unemployment and prison. The results for adopted children, on the other hand, are extremely good. They do well by all measures. When they experience problems, these often relate to their early childhood trauma at the hands of their natural parents, or to long periods spent 'in care' prior to adoption. In this book Patricia Morgan argues that childcare legislation and practice should be re-organised so that adoption becomes the first, not the last, option for children who cannot live with their parents. A child welfare system for the twenty-first century should be built around finding a permanent home for every child.",

We employed the life course theoretical framework to identify six themes across two developmental periods, pre-adulthood and adulthood: (1) constant fragmentation, (2) sudden fragmentation, (3) constrained agency, (4) learned substance abuse, (5) independence aborted, and (6) without a net. All reported childhoods characterized by disruption, although for some this only occurred after a lifechanging family event such as parental divorce or death. The majority described entering abusive relationships as adults and all became pregnant before the age of 20. Lacking family and friends able to help, they found themselves with limited economic options and often self-medicating through substance abuse that had been modeled in childhood and/or reinforced in adulthood. Findings underscore the need for rapid re-housing using a trauma-informed housing first model. Certain events in childhood, specifically parental divorce or death, are critical junctures for homeless prevention services. Further, evidence of reproductive coercion indicates that contraception, family planning, and economic supports may be critical targets for homeless prevention among women, as all of our participants reported an unplanned pregnancy by the age of 20 and poverty, often due to lack of education and job skills, rendering them dependent on male partners and abuse relationships.",

La desintegración familiar provoca problemas psicológicos de orden emocional y afectivo, que afectan su desempeño escolar: baja autoestima, repiten grados académicos, bajo rendimiento, deserción escolar, alteraciones de la conducta social, problemas de aprendizaje y se afecta las relaciones interpersonales dentro y fuera del aula de clase; sin embargo, en estos casos hay riesgos emocionales, no se respetan los derechos de la niñez. Los cambios emocionales de los niños, es síntoma de que algo sucede anormal, porque reflejan a través de actitudes y sentimientos. Concluyéndose que las causas de la desorganización familiar es por prevalecer adicciones por uno de sus padres, por la pobreza extrema y violencia familiar; y, existe una alta coincidencia entre las causas que originan la agresividad y las manifestaciones conductuales, observándose comportamiento impulsivo, baja autoestima y agresividad.&#x0D;",

      "title": "Early emotional social development of Siblings",
      "abstract": "This study aims to describe how families (parents and siblings) have a large role in the development of an individual. Families consisting of fathers, mothers and siblings (siblings) determine the direction of an individual's development to adulthood. Development is a progressive change from conception to old age and lasts throughout human life as a result of experience and maturity. The participants in this study were students of a private tertiary institution, which was the last child of four siblings, with three siblings. Data collection is done by observation and interview methods. The results showed that families especially siblings had a large contribution to the development of the Subject. Siblings can convert parent figures so that the subject tends to have the same characteristics with one sibling. The strong pressure of siblings can also suppress the true potential of the subject, due to difficulties and (ultimately) reluctance to think and act according to his expectations. All of this continues in a quiet attitude and often approves of many things that are decided in the family even though they sometimes conflict with his conscience. In their daily interactions with others, Subjects tend to be passive by listening more to others and choosing not to react to events that occur around them.",

      "abstract": "21 Australian widowed mothers with dependent children were matched with 21 divorced and 21 married mothers and comparisons were made on 4 types of well-being: 1) material 2) personal 3) family and 4) social. Compared with married mothers divorced mothers revealed consistently lower levels of economic well-being whereas widowed mothers tended to have lower levels of personal well-being. Aspects of well-being tended to be higher for mothers who were young and well educated regardless of family type. Family well-being refers to the extent to which family life is experienced as cohesive well-organized and satisfying. 5 items were selected that appeared to serve as indicators of material well-being: 1) total family income; 2) whether the family owned was purchasing or rented their home; 3) the number of rooms in the dwelling; 4) the number of changes of accommodation in the last 5 years; and 5) mothers responses to are there any things you can no longer afford to buy. Maternal age tended to be negatively correlated with aspects of family and personal well-being in all 3 groups of women. Time since family disruption was positively associated with aspects of well-being among widows and was negatively associated with aspects of well-being among divorcees. These findings have several implications for practitioners who deliver services to single parents: 1) interventions aimed at divorcees should primarily be directed toward the alleviation of economic problems and 2) interventions aimed at widows should primarily be directed toward increasing levels of personal well-being.",

A major pressure on adolescents is the loss of the extended family, with its consequent social isolation, especially produced by social mobility. Psychological maturation is difficult if adolescents do not have meaningful emotional attachments to adults who are not their parents, as well as to a stable peer group. Educational and care delivery systems could help. Particular problems have been created for the present generation of teenagers by changes in child rearing practices, the confusion of roles among parents, and the passivity induced by television watching. Problems in the school system are reinforced by an abrupt mix of social class and ethnic groups. The implication of adolescent stress in physical illness and its treatment, as well as the effect of syndromes such as epilepsy and diabetes on maturation, are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective To explore the lived experiences of shared children in stepfamilies (i.e., those born into a repartnered family who live with married parents and older half‐siblings). Background Shared children have been found to fare worse than other sibling groups on a variety of outcomes (e.g., educational outcomes, antisocial behavior, depressive symptoms). Little is known, however, about the lived experiences of these individuals. Method Using descriptive phenomenology, we conducted interviews with 20 shared children to answer the following research question: What is the nature of the experience of being a shared child in a stepfamily? Participants ranged in age from 19 to 30 years and lived in the same household with their half‐sibling(s) for at least some time growing up. Results Shared children's experiences were shaped by living in a hybrid “step‐nuclear” family; their upbringings were characterized by the tension of “reorganizing” as a nuclear unit but doing so within a larger stepfamily structure. The overriding phenomenon of participants' experiences was regulating family privacy boundaries—privacy rules existed surrounding sensitive information about family structure, marital histories, stepfamily dynamics, and more. In the absence of information, these children hypothesized about the topics that were not openly discussed in their families—a key part of their lived experiences. Conclusion Open communication with shared children surrounding family histories and dynamics may help reduce the ambiguity of living in a step‐nuclear family. Implications This study is an important step in understanding what about shared children's lived experiences might put them at higher risk for negative outcomes.",

      "title": "DENOMINATION OF SPINSTERS AND BACHELORS IN ARKHANGELSK DIALECTS",
      "abstract": "Terms of kinship are closely related to the lexico-semantic group associated with gender and age denomination, as well as the group associated with the determination of social status. Everything considered a norm has a high social status. Married women and men, children born in marriage fall under the norm. A situation is considered normal when a woman and a man perform their functions in marriage well, i. e. they take care of each other, their children, elderly parents, the house; a woman lives in her husband’s house. Everything that is contrary to the norm receives a negative assessment. Accordingly, people who are unmarried for various reasons, i.e. single men and women, have a low social status in traditional culture: spinsters and bachelors, widows and widowers, divorced spouses; illegitimate children; children who have lost or never had parents (or one of the parents), i. e. orphans; childless spouses; a woman who had a baby out of marriage; women and men who poorly perform their functions in marriage (bad parents, bad spouses – for example, drinkers, adulterers); a husband who came to live in his wife’s house. The article analyzes denomination and motivation for denomination of spinsters and bachelors, i. e. people who have never been married or got married at an older age as compared to what is considered ‘normal’. For the designation of a girl who did not get married in due time, about 20 lexemes and 30 attributive combinations were noted in Arkhangelsk dialects. Accordingly, there were noted about 20 lexemes and one and a half dozen word combinations designating a bachelor. To denote a spinster, there are used the same lexemes as for denoting a girl of marriageable age: virgin, girl, maid, etc. Words that have a direct meaning in the age and gender category receive a different meaning after being transfered to the lexico-semantic group ‘Social status’. The same lexemes can be used in other meanings, for example, ‘a woman who had a baby out of marriage’. Word combinations or phraseological units may be a motivation for the formation of lexemes denoting a spinster. Noteworthy are parallel names: old / elderly maid ~ old/elderly guy; starukha, staritsa ~ starik, starets (derived from the root ‘star’, which conveys the idea of being old); perestarok – for both men and women; kholostyak (which is explicitly translated as ‘bachelor’) ~ kholostovka, kholostyachka (feminine gender versions of ‘kholostyak’); bobyl’ ~ bobylka. However, this parallelism can be purely superficial: where a single man is concerned, the designations under study mean, as a rule, a guy who is not married yet; but when it comes to a single woman, the designations refer to a girl who has already missed the right time to get married. The change in the emphasis is very significant. The study is based on the material from published volumes of the Arkhangelsk Regional Dictionary, its card catalog and the author’s field notes.",

      "abstract": "The family provides the first, and most important, social, emotional, interpersonal, economic, and cultural context for human development and, as a result, family relationships have a profound influence on the well-being of children and parents. The parent-child relationship has a pervasive influence on the psychological, physical, social, and economic well-being of children. Disturbed interpersonal relationships within the family are generic risk factors and positive interpersonal relationships are protective factors that are related to a wide variety of mental health problems from infancy to old age (Sanders, 1995). Many significant mental health, social, and economic problems are linked to disturbances in family functioning and the breakdown of family relationships (Chamberlain & Patterson, 1995; Patterson, 1982; Sanders & Duncan, 1995). Epidemiological studies indicate that family risk factors such as poor parenting, family conflict, and marriage breakdown strongly influence children's development (e.g.,, Cummings & Davies, 1994; Dryfoos, 1990; Robins, 1991). Specifically, a lack of a warm positive relationship with parents; insecure attachment, harsh, inflexible, rigid, or inconsistent discipline practices; inadequate supervision of and involvement with children; marital conflict and breakdown; and parental psychopathology (particularly maternal depression) increase the risk that children develop major behavioral and emotional problems, including substance abuse, antisocial behavior and juvenile crime (e.g.,, Coie, 1996; Loeber & Farrington, 1998).",

Various stressors appear to have the power to disrupt parenting practices seriously by causing some parents to be more irritable, critical, and punitive. Such parenting behaviors increase the likelihood that children develop conduct problems, setting in motion a cycle of negative parent-child interactions and further stress on the parents. This process appears to be mediated by patents' psychological well being, quality of social support or degree of isolation, sex and drug use.",

      "title": "Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior Problems in Middle School: An Ecological-Transactional, Cross-Sectional Examination of Early Adolescent Adjustment",
      "abstract": "IntroductionAdolescents are in a unique developmental period where they are dependent on their parents but are also beginning to strive toward independence. Given that adolescents' growing autonomy often takes them outside of their family of origin, a more involved ecological-transactional model may offer a better understanding of the behavior problems that adolescents can experience. In fact, Bronfenbrenner (1) is credited with first developing an ecological model, with his model describing a microsystem (i.e., individuals' daily social relationships and physical settings), a mesosystem (i.e., interrelationships among the various settings in which individuals find themselves), an exosystem (i.e., social structures that directly or indirectly affect individuals), and a macrosystem (i.e., cultural patterns of a society). Consistent with such an ecological model, this study examined adolescents' behavior problems at two different time points in the context of parents' characteristics (microsystem; 2), teacher and peer support (exosystem; 3), family socioeconomic status (macrosystem; 4), and acculturation status (macrosystem; 5).Regarding parenting characteristics, this study examined parenting style, warmth, rejection, and support, as these characteristics clearly are important for adolescents' adjustment. For example, an authoritative parenting style was associated with the most favorable adolescent outcomes (e.g., fewer problem behaviors, better academics, more life satisfaction; 6). Similarly, adolescents whose parents exhibited high warmth and support and low rejection were less likely to develop emotional and behavioral problems (7). Given these findings, parenting characteristics clearly still are important to predicting adolescents' behavior problems.Regarding school, this study examined adolescents' perceived support from teachers and peers. Research demonstrated that adolescents' social skills and academic competence were related to perceived emotional support from teachers (8,9). Way, Reddy, and Rhodes (10) provided further support for the importance of teacher support, with adolescents' perceptions of teacher support decreasing over time and this decrease being related significantly to increases in adolescents' depressive symptoms and behavior problems. Perceptions of peer support also were important, as adolescents who had negative perceptions of peer support experienced emotional problems more than behavioral problems (11).Elements of acculturation status, ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status also were examined in this study, as these variables may be important to adolescents' behavior problems. Research demonstrated that acculturation status was related negatively (and usually indirectly) to adolescents' emotional and behavioral problems (5). Further, children who had more language difficulties were more likely to have behavior problems, possibly due to higher acculturative stress (12). Generally, research also suggested that there was an indirect relationship between socioeconomic status and adolescents' development. In particular, economic deprivation was associated significantly with family disruption during childhood, which subsequently predicted maladjustment in adulthood (4). Similarly, lower levels of financial stability were related to disrupted family routines, which predicted subsequently depressive symptoms and other problematic outcomes in African American adolescents (13).Although research examined various factors related to adolescents' behavior problems, less is known about the differential significance of these variables as adolescents proceed through middle school. A clearer picture of the differential importance of variables depending on the transition into and out of middle school could provide helpful insights for intervention and prevention efforts. Consistent with previous literature (14) and a recent examination of an ecological model for adolescents' externalizing problems (15), the current ecologicaltransactional model examined the unique predictive value of the variables noted above for both sixth and eighth graders' internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. …",

Social initiative measures together with reciprocal parental response measures adopted from Clarke‐Stewart were used. The infants distributed their social initiatives equally to both parents but made fewer initiatives when older. Ma ternal and paternal contingent responsiveness was highly correlated at both age levels. However, infants played more with their fathers than with their mothers. It is argued that the stylistic differences in how mothers and fathers responded to their infants represent differences in typical performance but not in optimal performance. Both parents become attachment figures because of their contingent responsiveness but with complementary, not redundant, roles.",

The caring motivation is encompassing and includes reactive and proactive care, care for familiar others and strangers, and in dyads and groups, and it covers a large number of provisions such as comforting, cooperating, and mentoring. Each developmental period involves increasing sophistication and the addition of new arenas (e.g., peers, romantic relations, parenting) and skills. Four distinct yet interconnected psychological paths for the expression of caring emerge: emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, morality, and meaning in life. Ubiquitous and intrinsically governed care emerges during the second year of life when the infant’s self also buds. Cultural contexts strongly control the how, where, to whom, and why individuals should help and in general contribute to limiting caring acts. Yet maturation and culture also contribute to broadening the scope of this motivation to be enacted across differences and distances.",

Comparing exchanges with friends and non-friends reveals significant differences in structure and content. These are more numerous and marked among elder children whose friendships are more comprehensive, but in both groups, play is the most typical behavior of friends. Correlations between children's social behavior and number of friends indicate that prosocial behaviors have an important attractive power to one-year-old children, irrespective of the frequency of agressive behaviors, whereas two-year-olds reject those who repeatedly perform agressive acts. As well as a space for personal opening, friendship creates a preferential frame for social development, where children test their newest and most sophisticated social behaviors before extending them to non-friend partners.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Few phenomena are as widely experienced across different individuals, cultures, and contexts as that of traumatic stress. Whether as victims, perpetrators, supporters, or simply observers, most if not all people can identify to some extent with the psychological and physical consequences produced by traumatic events. Such incidents are as varied as the individuals who must deal with them: The grief produced by the sudden death of a loved one, the self-doubt present in a victim's response to rape, the loss of autonomy following a debilitating injury, and the absence of social identity in the wake of genocidal terror are just a few of the experiences that make up the subject matter of traumatic stress. The consequences of such events also reach beyond the individuals who directly suffer these ordeals. Those who interact with the victims as they attempt to overcome the traumas often endure their own costs. The child who survives the death of a sibling does so in the difficult context of the parents' grief. Individuals close to a victim of severe physical injury frequently must take on new responsibilities as they deal with a friend whose capabilities and limitations have been forever altered. The family of a man who has lost his beloved wife must attempt to find solace for themselves while still offering comfort to the one who was closest to her. The consequences of traumatic events, while certainly devastating for the most immediate victims, are therefore also experienced by the people in the social network that surrounds those victims.",

      "abstract": "Not all older persons will experience dementia but dementia is, by a wide margin, most likely to be experienced by persons age 65 and older. This chapter examines how characteristic relationship patterns and family dynamics of later life intersect with the experience of dementia in old age, and the ways in which law has responded to those intersections to create a distinct subgenre of family law focused on the older parent/adult child and late-life spousal relationships. At a historical moment when family members are normatively independent, no longer defined in relation to one another by traditional socially defined roles, family caregiving of older parents/spouses with dementia remains the expectation (despite decreased availability of the “free” female labour provided by daughters and daughters in law in the past). Concerns about capacity, undue influence, caregiving expectations, exploitation, and abuse may arise in the context of both old and new spousal relationships (with distinctive causes and implications). The older parent/adult child dynamic is multifaceted and complex, as old resentments and sensitivities about intra-familial fairness mix with new obligations and concerns about parental vulnerability to exploitation and harm (of which adult children may also be a source).",

      "abstract": "In two experiments, children between ll/2 and 7l/2 years of age were tested on a predicted, eight-step sequence of the development of social roles. Performance on this sequence was related to two measures of more spontaneous behavior. Nearly all children fit the predicted sequence perfectly. By 2 years of age, most children could make a doll act as an independent agent. The majority of 3-yearolds could make a doll carry out several behaviors fitting the role of doctor. At age 4 or 5, most children developed the capacity to show a social role, making a doctor doll interact with a patient doll. The intersection of social roles for two agents appeared at about age 6: A man doll could be both doctor and father to a patient who was also his daughter. In their spontaneous behavior, early preschoolers almost always showed the highest step that they were capable of, but beginning with the step for social roles, late preschoolers seldom showed their highest step. For children to act and feel socially competent, they need to understand roles such as mother, father, doctor, and patient. Despite the importance of these social roles in the child's life, the development of social roles in the preschool years is, at best, only",

This study investigated the environment of eight adolescents in these residential homes and four non-aggressive adolescents living with their families. The daily activities were recorded by using cameraglasses attached to the subject. These activities took place in school, leisure time, family and residential homes. Other additional methods were used to investigate the perception and experience of these adolescents. The results of this study indicate that the adolescents in residential homes have a smaller living space in contrast to the non-aggressive adolescents. They also have less close relationships and fewer interactions with their peers. Moreover they have more conflicts and show more often aggressive behavior and they are more often victims of aggression. (DIPF/Orig.)",

Family members often play a central role in the care of the patient, particularly in the case of children, the elderly and chronically ill. The impact of illness on the family ranges from the sudden loss of the breadwinner caused by a myocardial infarction to the often overwhelming challenges of a child diagnosed with a developmental disability. The disequilibrium in the family resulting from illness can also alter the established rules and expectations of family members, transform their methods of communication and substantially alter the family structure. The family may represent a safe refuge for the ill person but it may also aggravate the illness through maladaptive responses.",

Three infant titis were observed with their natal family groups over the first six months of life. Field observations of extensive male involvement with infants were confirmed. Adult males were clearly the infants' primary social companions, and infants spent more time in contact with adult males at all ages than with mothers or older siblings. However, mothers and siblings also carried infants at times and interacted with them in affiliative ways (e.g., grooming, nuzzling, play). Mothers often invited nursing, but otherwise it was infants who primarily initiated transfers between carriers and approaches to parents, reminding us that the infants' own activities and their effects on caregivers should not be overlooked in considerations of the patterns of infant care. This is particularly important for those species exhibiting extensive parental involvement by males. It is suggested that substantial male care of young titi infants leads to several important consequences for the infant's social development, including the development of a stronger attachment to the father than the mother.",

      "abstract": "Reproductive loss, which includes miscarriage and nongestational loss, such as adoption loss, is rarely recognized as part of the family-building journey. Such loss tends to be even more invisible among LGBTQ individuals. The current study examines the experiences of 80 LGBTQ individuals who experienced adoption-related losses (i.e., failed adoption matches, child removals, disrupted child placements), with attention to how these losses impacted them and what enabled them to move forward. Participants who pursued private domestic adoption experienced failed matches (i.e., birth parents deciding to parent or choosing another family) both before ( n = 21) and/or after ( n = 24) a child was born. Participants who pursued public domestic adoption experienced child removals involving reunification with birth parents ( n = 14) and other birth relatives ( n = 18), as well as disrupted placements initiated by parents ( n = 10) and children ( n = 7). Failed matches, child removals, and disrupted placements were typically experienced as “crushing” and invisible losses. They were often followed by a period of grieving, and sometimes prompted adjustments to the type of matches or placements participants would consider (e.g., to mitigate the likelihood of future similar losses). Moving forward from adoption losses was facilitated by support from partners and those who experienced similar losses, knowledge or hope regarding the children once in their care, and finally being placed with the child(ren) whom they ultimately legally adopted.",

      "title": "The Transition from Engagement to Marriage",
      "abstract": "Marriage is a complex social-psychological phenomenon. From a sociological point of view, the decision to get married involves an undertaking to form a new familial unit in society; this undertaking usually involves two already formed families (of orientation) as well as various groups with which each individual articulates. Getting married also involves participant in a major role transition in society. Whether it is succesfully traversed or not will determine whether the particular new social unit is formed or not. From a societal point of view then, it is important that this transition be traversed successfully for the social institution of marriage to continue in some form. From the point of view of the individuals concerned, there are also major psychological determinants and consequences. Marriage can be seen both as providing an opportunity for growth and maturation of personality and as reinvoking a return to and repetition of certain preoccupations of childhood. The return to an exclusive two-person relationship, perhaps for the first time since early childhood, stimulates the re-emergence of both the good and bad experiences of earlier periods of development. This makes the marriage relationship especially open to a richness of emotional experience and, by the same token, renders it particularly vulnerable to emotional disturbances. 1) We are concerned with the getting married process both as a social-psychological phenomenon and from the viewpoint of preventive social psychiatry and these two viewpoint complement each other in that mental health determinants affect not only individuals' mental health but the functioning of social units. One of the major functions of the newly created family unit is the maintenance of adult personalities2), which involves psychological as well as sociological processes. Given the fact that getting married involves a transition of vital importance to one's person, to the ones with whom one was intimately involved before the marriage and to one's subsequent family of procreation, then it seems important to consider the processes that are involved for individuals making the transition. There are indications from the marriage and family field and from other fields of social-psychological enquiry that the manner in which the transition is made has major effects on subsequent events. For instance, if we view the engagement",

Humility is a developmental process, shaped and expressed within social systems from the beginning of life. Humility emerges naturally from beingness co-constructed by family and community. When parents and caregivers are humble before the needs of children, providing the evolved nest or developmental system for raising the young, a cascade of long-term effects ensues. When a baby is not treated with respect and empathy, with needs met promptly, neurobiology develops in the direction of self-protection with a cacostatic (too much or too little) orientation (dominance or submission) toward others, undermining capacities for humility. The cascade of effects shape cultural practices from the ground up, as individuals form and shape community cultures that carry across generations. Relational humility is defined as multilayered, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and ecological humility—relational attunement with others and with the web of life.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this research was to identify the socialization styles of the older person (such as authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and negligent) in three different roles: (1) nowadays as a grandparent, (2) considering the style used to educate their own children in the past; and (3), considering the socialization style they received when they were children. The sample (317 people over 65 years old with at least one grandchild aged up to 16 years old participated) received the questionnaire on socialization styles in those roles. The results showed the predominance of the indulgent style in their role as grandparents. Almost 80% showed intergenerational continuity between at least two roles, with the exception of those with a neglectful style. Continuity in socialization style is crucial to understanding the dynamics within family relationships, which have highly durable intergenerational ties.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, the relationship between dependency (child maltreatment and status offending) and delinquency will be examined from a social ecology perspective. Initially, dependency would appear to be exclusively a family problem. Children are maltreated within their immediate environment as victims of violence (i.e., physical abuse), exploitation (i.e., sexual abuse), or neglect (i.e., lack of parental supervision). Children become status offenders as a consequence of other parent-child relationship problems (e.g., ungovernability and truancy). Dependent children tend to come from dysfunctional families, and dysfunctional families tend to bring about maltreated and incorrigible children who are at risk for delinquent behaviors. The connection appears logical enough to attract the interest of juvenile justice policymakers and practitioners. However, what has eluded policymakers and practitioners is the dynamic of this relationship. To provide a context for better understanding how dependency and delinquency are interrelated, basic concepts and the scope of status offending and maltreatment are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "In cases of adolescent delinquency the family physician may be called upon for help by the court, the parents, or even the child himself. The request for help can come from the adolescent even before he is in serious trouble, but it may be disguised in terms of concern for his bodily functions. In a society that is extremely critical of parents of delinquent children the parents have to deal with community feelings of disapproval as well as the troublesome behavior of their children. A vicious circle develops in which the parents treat their child as a bad person and the child becomes convinced that he has been rejected. Sometimes the physician can break this circle by emphasizing the positive personality attributes of all concerned. Some adolescents unable to develop close relationships with their parents are able to develop them with other adults, and such relationships, often informal, may be accompanied by rapid disappearance of delinquent behavior. Thus, there are many ways in which a physician can be of service to the delinquent and his parents, and many of these services are extremely gratifying.",

In the strange situation, infants directed attachment behaviors primarily toward mothers and secondarily toward network members, who were clearly preferred to strangers. The extent to which infants showed attachment behavior toward network members was related to infant-mother attachment behavior, to the network person's responsiveness in teaching, and to the network person's position in the mother's social network",

      "abstract": "Young children who stay with their families in homeless shelters face chronic challenges related to extreme poverty and acute risks from stressful events surrounding the loss of housing and move to shelter. These adversities increase the likelihood of a range of poor developmental outcomes. Consistent with the risk and resilience perspective, however, many children who experience family homelessness succeed, functioning as well or better than their non-homeless peers. As such, efforts to support resilience should consider how best to enhance protective factors, such as supportive environments within shelter settings.With data from 60 caregivers of children ages birth to 5 years recruited from family shelters, we assessed caregivers' perceptions of community support as well as child and family well-being in terms of recent adverse experiences, parenting stress, access to social support, and child social-emotional functioning.Many caregivers experiencing family homelessness perceived negative aspects of the shelters where they were staying with their children. Furthermore, children whose caregivers had more negative perceptions of the shelter environment displayed worse social-emotional functioning, even when accounting for differences in parenting stress, recent family adversity, and other sources of social support.Because young children rely on their caregivers as primary resources for nurturance and support, we encourage family homelessness service providers to work in partnership with caregivers to create more inclusive and empowering practices within the shelter context. Doing so is likely to improve children's developmental outcomes and the overall well-being of the families.",

This reflects differences in self care: the presence or absence of bad habits, different levels of literacy and information about health risks, the value placed on health, and the extent of people's commitment to maintain their health.",

      "abstract": "The article summarizes the results of the studies of reproductive attitudes of the Russian students (born in 1982-2000) published in 2000-2017. Students lack life experience, thus, they make moral choices under conflicting media information and sometimes even propaganda of certain values or anti-values concerning family, marriage, and motherhood (paternity). A low level of students' awareness of the main issues in planning and creating a family, giving birth to children, taking care of their health is accompanied by an early start of active and risky sexual life. Despite the unconditional authority and positive example of parents, most young people independently search for information about sexual relations and sometimes get negative and painful experience. There are three types of young people: (1) the majority respect traditional family values, try (or wish) to follow them and to some extent succeed; (2) a significant part respect traditional family values but cannot or do not want to follow them (including approving and practicing cohabitation); (3) about a tenth do not respect and do not follow traditional values concerning marriage and family, refuse and oppose them; marriage does not matter for such students, they have no desire to give birth and raise a child, do not think about the morality of relationships between sexes, po-lygamy, abandonment of the child or abortion. Students indicate factors influencing their family plans and reproductive behavior: social-psychological (own beliefs, opinion of the closest people, limitation of the time resource; unplanned pregnancy and perception of abortion; availability and quality of the partner; social-psychological maturity; perceptions of the future - confidence in it); religiosity; experience (example of the parents' family); social-demographic (age; structure of the parents' family); economic (availability and quality of housing; financial situation); physical (health status); institutional (state family policy, influence of the church and media, values and traditions of society). Thus, the young people reproductive attitudes and the idea of a family are determined by various factors including values and traditions of the closest social circle and society in general.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Little is known about prosocial behaviours in children of young mothers. This longitudinal study involved 44 young mother (age &lt;20 years at birth of first child) families and 44 older mother families, who were carefully matched for child age and gender, as well as for family structure (number of children, lone‐parent status) and socio‐economic background (maternal education, head‐of‐household unemployment, low family income). At the first time‐point ( M child age = 2.45 years), mothers listed family members or friends who provided practical and/or emotional support; videos of mother–child interaction in play and tidy‐up were coded for positive and negative parenting. Two years later ( M child age = 4.32 years), children's prosocial behaviours were assessed via (i) an experimental task of willingness to share and (ii) video‐based ratings of sharing and helping during dyadic play with friends. T ‐tests showed few group differences in prosocial behaviours. Regression analyses showed that, for young mother families only, reduced negative parenting mediated associations between support from friends and preschoolers' willingness to share. Support from friends, via parenting, may promote willingness to share in children born to young mother families. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The unsupervised or hastily conceived movement of children out of foster care is not in the best interest of any child. Careful consideration of all possible permanency options must take place, and include the input of all potential care givers, stakeholders, and the child. Legal and judicial partners in the child welfare process must take a broader approach to family finding and engagement for every child in foster care so that more children find permanent homes. The goal of family finding and engagement may not be placing a child with a family member but can include locating non‐custodial parents to terminate rights to free the child for adoption, to notify a non‐custodial parent that his child is in care and explore his interest in reunification, or finding family members who may not be able to take physical custody of the child but can act as a resource for her. Each of these can be a viable permanent outcome in the best interest of the child and, therefore, should not be limited by geographic or cultural boundaries. All stakeholders in the permanency planning process can address these potential barriers by adopting a broader, more global, view of the range of permanent placements and family connections for all children in foster care.",

      "title": "LVU – ett tillräckligt skydd för unga som lever under hot om hedersrelaterat våld och förtryck? - En studie av tillämpningen av rekvisitet ”socialt nedbrytande beteende” i 3 § LVU",
      "abstract": "According to The Care of Young Persons (Special Provisions) Act (LVU) the Swedish state has a responsibility to intervene in the care of a young person when circumstances show deficiencies in the care, or some other circumstance at home, which involve a manifest risk that the young person's health or development might be harmed (2 § LVU). In addition, compulsory care may also be necessary where circumstances show that a young person exposes her or himself to significant risks through a socially destructive behaviour (3 § LVU). In cases where young people are subject to honour-related violence or oppression at home 2 § LVU may apply. Whether a young person's own behaviour (3 § LVU) may constitute grounds for care in cases where the person wishes to return to an environment where he or she is at risk of being exposed to honour-related violence and oppression is, however, still unclear.\r\n\r\nBy combining legal analysis with a traditional legal dogmatic method, the purpose of this thesis is therefore to review the Swedish regulation in 3 § LVU based on the requirements of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) with regard to the best interest of the child (CRC) and the principle of non-discrimination (CEDAW). The purpose of this thesis is thus to highlight the legal challenges that the CRC and CEDAW pose in relation to the Swedish regulation on compulsory care of young persons in cases where the persons wish to return to an environment, where they are at risk of being exposed to honour-related violence and oppression.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion this thesis shows that – in cases of honour-related violence and oppression – the legal challenges faced by the Swedish regulation on compulsory care with regard to 3 § LVU are complex. In order for the regulation to better adapt to the requirements of the CRC and the CEDAW, the fundamental principles embodied in the two conventions need to be not only more emphasized, but also better clarified from a Swedish legislative work perspective. In addition, the Swedish legislator must clarify what constitutes a socially destructive behaviour under the provisions of 3 § LVU in order to both ensure fundamental rights and strengthen the protection for young persons who are at risk of becoming victims of honour-related violence and oppression.",

      "abstract": "When parents, guardians, or other relatives are unable or unwilling to discharge normal parental duties, two problems arise. The less important is the kind of sanctions that may be imposed on those who fail in their duty. They are few and for the most part ineffective. The important question is how best to deal with the children. The general solution to this major problem is by a system of public care, but the phrase covers a considerable area of family law that, until recently, had received inadequate systematic study, certainly by lawyers. This is no longer true,1 but as often happens when an area is studied intensively, one of the first discoveries is how little is known. The records of successful public care of children are so meagre that the policies to be pursued are acutely controversial. Realisation of the social cost of adult recidivists has coincided with increasing knowledge of children's psychological development. Old attitudes are being discarded and new approaches attempted, but there are many pitfalls. As a result it is probably true to say that the law regarding children in public care is at present of all English family law the most disordered.",

A series of behaviour patterns is elicited by the different stages of the developing young and these are related to the way of life of the animals concerned. Infants which are born naked, blind and helpless elicit retrieving and nest building and are cleaned and cared for by the female. Older animals or those born with fur, but with poor locomotion, are still carried and cleaned. When the young can move well other behaviour patterns which keep the young and mother together are important, so signals for communication and recognition of individuals develop. At the end of lactation various behaviour patterns bring about weaning. Sometimes this is the result of dispersal by the young, and sometimes the young are actively rejected or deliberately abandoned. Several examples of maternal behaviour are given in relation to the classes of mammals and some related problems are discussed.",

      "title": "Evolution de la perception sensorielle et des préférences alimentaires chez les personnes âgées : quel lien avec le statut nutritionnel ?",
      "abstract": "Le processus de vieillissement, meme lorsqu’il se deroule normalement, est associe a de nombreuses modifications d’ordre physiologiques (ralentissement du transit intestinal, du metabolisme basal, perte de dents, alterations des capacites chimiosensorielles), psychologiques (solitude, depression, demence) et sociologiques (retraite, veuvage, demenagement…) susceptibles d’avoir un impact sur la prise alimentaire et le statut nutritionnel de la personne âgee. Au-dela de ces changements, l’apparition d’une dependance pour l’alimentation, qui fait generalement suite a une perte d’autonomie de la personne (apparition d’une incapacite physique ou psychique, veuvage…), modifie en profondeur le rapport de la personne a son alimentation. Des lors qu’une personne âgee doit deleguer tout ou partie de son alimentation a une aide menagere ou a un service de restauration collective, elle doit s’adapter aux pratiques culinaires, aux habitudes alimentaires, voire aux preferences alimentaires de tierces personnes. Au regard de ces changements, l’âge et la dependance s’accompagne frequemment d’une diminution de l’appetit et d’une degradation du statut nutritionnel. Selon les estimations de la HAS (2007), 4 a 10% des personnes âgees vivant a domicile seraient denutries et cette proportion atteindrait entre 15 et 38% des personnes âgees vivant en EHPAD (Etablissement d’Hebergement pour Personnes Agees Dependantes). A l’heure actuelle, la prevention et la lutte contre la denutrition s’appuient essentiellement sur une prise en charge nutritionnelle – mise en place de regimes alimentaires adaptes, formulation d’aliments enrichis, prescription de complements alimentaires. Or, comme l’exprime la grande majorite des personnes âgees, l’acte alimentaire – manger – est et reste avant tout un plaisir. « C’est meme le dernier plaisir qu’il nous reste » pour reprendre l’expression d’une personne interrogee dans le cadre de nos travaux. Afin de mieux comprendre le lien entre plaisir sensoriel et etat nutritionnel chez les personnes âgees, une enquete multidisciplinaire a ete realisee aupres de 559 personnes âgees de plus de 65 ans. Cette enquete comprenait pres de 200 questions portant entre autre sur les habitudes et les preferences alimentaires des seniors, leur perception des odeurs et des saveurs des aliments ainsi que sur leur etat de sante et leur etat nutritionnel. Cette enquete a ete menee dans quatre villes francaises (Angers, Brest, Nantes et Dijon), aupres de seniors vivant en EHPAD ou a domicile, avec ou sans aide exterieure. Les resultats ont mis en evidence une grande variabilite au sein de la population âgee, tant au niveau de la perception sensorielle que des preferences alimentaires. Alors que la communaute scientifique admet que les capacites chimiosensorielles diminuent avec l’âge, l’enquete a montre qu’environ 45% de la population âgee presentait des capacites sensorielles preservees. Le reste de la population se partage entre ceux qui percoivent plutot moins bien les odeurs et ceux qui percoivent plutot moins bien les saveurs. En parallele, les resultats ont mis en evidence trois styles de mangeurs. Les amateurs de “mitonne” preferent la viande au poisson, le beurre a l’huile et ne peuvent pas se passer d’un dessert a la fin de leur repas. Les amateurs de “bonne chair” apprecient un bon roti, saignant de preference. Ces personnes apprecient un bon verre de vin pour accompagner leur repas mais n’apprecient pas particulierement les produits sucres. Enfin, les amateurs de “naturalite” preferent le poisson a la viande, l’huile au beurre. Ils apprecient les legumes, en particulier cuits a la vapeur, et rejettent les plats tout prepares. Si peu de liens ont ete observes entre perception sensorielle et preferences alimentaires, les resultats ont en revanche montre que les personnes presentant une forte alteration olfactive tendent a avoir un statut nutritionnel plus fragile. A l’inverse, les amateurs de “naturalite” tendent a avoir un meilleur statut nutritionnel. Fort de ces constats, l’enjeu des travaux a venir est de developper des aliments repondant a la fois aux attentes en matiere d’habitudes alimentaires et de preferences des personnes âgees, tout en tenant compte de leurs capacites chimiosensorielles et de leurs besoins nutritionnels. In fine, l’objectif est d’augmenter le plaisir associe au repas pour cette population et de contribuer ainsi a la lutte contre la denutrition. Remerciements.

Masalah kesehtan jiwa lansia yang sering muncul adalah gangguan proses piker yang ditandai dengan lupa, pikun, bingung, dan curiga; gangguan perasaan diantaranya ditandai dengan kelelahan, acuh tak acuh, mudah tersinggung; gangguan fisik/somatic tanpa penyebab yang jelas meliputi gangguan pola tidur, gangguan makan dan minum; gangguan perilaku ditandai dengan enggan berhubungan dengan orang lain, dan ketidakmampuan merawat diri sendiri.Keluarga merupakan masyarakat terkecil dimana lansia berada. Perubahan kejiwaan pada lansia akan mempengaruhi status kesehatan keluarga. Oleh karena itu keluarga dan lansia perlu mengetahui perubahan kejiwaan pada lansia agar dapat mencegah terjadinya gangguan jiwa pada lansia. Keterlibatan keluarga akan menentukan keberhasilan perawatan kesehatan jiwa lansia yang digambarkan pada tulisan ini. Abstract Changing in physical and psychosocial in elderly associated with aging. The observed changes represent the cumulative effects of heredity, environment, nutrition, rest, activity and altered health state while the most observed changes in psychosocial state of the elderly such as forgetfulress, memory loss, norrowed, attention spans, confusional states and impairment of their mind and emotional states increased accompany with their physical state. Family is the closest person around the elderly, a caring attitude, calm conversation and promotion of the comfort contribute to the relief of confusional states, and also emotional support helps the family cope with the elderly persons disorientation and confusion. Family is the most important person to help the elderly in maintaining their health states physically and psychosocially.Keywords: Changing in physical and psychosocial states in elderly, family participation.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A significant majority of patients with borderline personality disorder in a long-term psychiatric hospital for adolescents had been the daughters of younger middle class mothers (14–20) with fathers absent since birth or before age 5. This family configuration is optimal for the growth of a symbiotic mother-daughter relationship and the identity disorder prevalent in borderline patients. The similar histories of these patients are examined. They can be described in two categories: those who combine precocious sexuality with infantile behavior and a smaller group with a somewhat masculine pseudo-mature identity. The first group usually attempts to retreat to the father, has clinging, dependent relationships with males, sexually acts out and is at a very high risk for pregnancy and a repetition of the mothers' lives.",

These age-associated events include changes in physical appearance and body composition, which can result in increased vulnerability to both acute and chronic physical illness as well as functional limitations such as decreased mobility and diminished sensory capacities. In addition, older people generally experience numerous losses and stressors, such as moving to a fixed income, increasing expenses, and loss of retirement investments; death of family members, friends and loss of social network; alterations in social position; changes in housing and work; and spousal caregiving and widowhood. The ability to adapt positively to these types of stressful life event and to other adversities is likely an important factor in \"successful\" aging.",

      "abstract": "When adults make a joint commitment to act together, they feel an obligation to their partner. In 2 studies, the authors investigated whether young children also understand joint commitments to act together. In the first study, when an adult orchestrated with the child a joint commitment to play a game together and then broke off from their joint activity, 3-year-olds (n = 24) reacted to the break significantly more often (e.g., by trying to re-engage her or waiting for her to restart playing) than when she simply joined the child's individual activity unbidden. Two-year-olds (n = 24) did not differentiate between these 2 situations. In the second study, 3- and 4-year-old children (n = 30 at each age) were enticed away from their activity with an adult. Children acknowledged their leaving (e.g., by looking to the adult or handing her the object they had been playing with) significantly more often when they had made a joint commitment to act together than when they had not. By 3 years of age, children thus recognize both when an adult is committed and when they themselves are committed to a joint activity.",

Analyses are based on data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples, a prospective study of 1,532 married individuals aged 65 and older. Compared to married persons, widowed persons are less likely to have a confidant, yet they receive greater support from children, friends, and relatives, controlling for support prior to widowhood. The findings suggest that, although close social relationships may remain stable in the course of normal aging, stressful events such as widowhood may bring forth both losses and gains in social support.",

      "title": "Dysfunctional family, child abuse and national instability",
      "abstract": "It is in the very nature of counselling psychology to treat, address and manage situations emerging from abusive relationship, dysfunctional families, natural and man-made traumas, and to help toxic families find a new path to a better and functional family structure. It has been referred to as “mental health First aid.” The toxic nature of a dysfunctional family results in child abuse, abandonment, neglect and trauma, which negatively manifests in the child’s behaviour and personality, and subsequently transmitted to the nation. Put it in another way, the mental characteristic of a child bears an indelible resemblance of theenvironment (family and society) in which he or she is raised. Hence, a corrupt and unjust nation displays a magnitude of dysfunctionality that is harboured in its families, and the number of delinquent and mentally unbalanced and maladaptive children it generates. With rampant cases of child abuse, dysfunctional family and destabilizing environmental conditions many children are traumatized. Once traumatized, one may also traumatize others, especially if not treated or prevented. This explains why civilized societies put all they have in safeguarding children from toxic homes and abusive conditions. Make no mistake about it, children traumatized do not necessarily become only depressed, isolated or intellectually deprived adults, they do also become charismatic, intelligent, outspoken, and eloquent adults, although with repressed unconscious (deep-rooted) mental injuries. Retrospectively, these undiagnosed and untreated traumatized children may eventually become senator, doctor, lecturer, governor, president, parent, policy-maker, priest or trader. These mental injuries, manifesting in the form of explosive, heartless, brutal and corrupt behaviour will be imperative and apparent. This paper examines and highlights the essential qualities required of a modern counselling psychologist. These unique qualities qualify a counselling psychologist as a competent clinical practitioner, and an effective change agent and nation-builder. Drawing from many theoretical and scientific reviews, this paper will try to buttress characteristic features, knowledge-base and ethical conduct that befit a modern counselling psychologist.",

      "abstract": "Every culture has its own stories about what it means to be a \"good parent\". In Canada, this includes a parent who has the resources to look after children in a consistently nurturing manner, a parent who will put the needs of her children before her or his own needs, and a parent who can meet the challenges of parenting in a variety of different circumstances. The portrayal of \"good parent\" excludes parents who love their children but have difficulties of their own that sometimes get in the way of meeting their children's needs. These parents are often judged harshly in our society and their different experiences of \"mother\" and \"father\" are misrepresented, diminished, or dismissed. Sometimes, their children are removed from their care. There are many parents \"on the margins\" who face these circumstances; included in this group are parents who experience mental health difficulties. In Canada, 12.1% of all children under the age of twelve lives with a parent who has been given at least one psychiatric diagnosis in the previous twelve months (Bassani, Padoin, Phillipp, & Veldhuizen, 2009).",

      "abstract": "The parent– child relationship provides the most important context for promoting healthy child development (Sims, 2000). However, a healthy parent– child relationship is unlikely to be seen in the environment of the juvenile court. Created 100 years ago in Chicago, the juvenile court is charged with the responsibility of protecting children from the family members who have abused, abandoned, and neglected them. Juvenile court is a place of last resort where the state’s interest in protecting the lives of children is more compelling than the sanctity and privacy of the relationship between a parent and child. The juvenile court intervenes to protect and rehabilitate children when all else has failed. Once the mother has reached the juvenile court, tremendous harm has already been done, the negative effects of which can only be decreased by facilitating a healing process for the child and the family. The juvenile court is in a unique position to initiate the marshalling and creation of community resources to fulfill the statutory duty of the court to heal the child. Emerging research indicates that young children in the child welfare system are at great risk for cognitive and developmental delays (Dicker, Gordon, & Knitzer, 2001). Entry in the child welfare system may provide an opportunity for the juvenile court to evaluate and treat the child for previously undiscovered problems. The children who are under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court see doctors usually only for emergencies and have poor health care. Their parents are not able to determine the nature and extent of developmental and cognitive",

The child was seen as primarily the person with whom one should work, and the clinic as the setting where therapy should take place.

However, less is known about what happens within a family structure if an unsupportive parent or family member leaves the family unit and sees the child only on the condition that they present in a way that conforms to their birth gender. This paper will focus on the first interviews with nine families within the wider sample of 39 families in the LOGIC-Q (Longitudinal Outcomes of Gender Identity in Children – qualitative) study who reported they had experienced rejection by a parent or family member after the young person had disclosed their gender non-conformity. These families’ narratives are examined through two themes: How rejection impacts visitation, and Moving past the loss of rejection. The families all spoke about how they had adapted to the loss of their family members. They described how any negative impact would have been worse had they stayed living together, or were in contact with, the rejecting family member. Here, it becomes important then to understand the context of why a gender-diverse young person may choose to no longer see a parent or family member.",

This process, compared to previous generations, takes place in qualitatively different conditions. Moreover, the current attributes of an adult have become obsolete. For this reason, making the vision of oneself reality may be associated with various difficulties. The root of the failure to clarify identity is to be found in the original bond with the guardian and in all experiences that disrupt attachment. Among these types of experiences, relational trauma and parentification are worth mentioning. Relational trauma can be said to be when a child experiences repeated neglect in the context of a close relationship. A similar phenomenon is parentification.The aim of the research is to check 1) whether there are significant differences between the identified identity statuses and 2) whether the variables (attachment style, experience of parentification and relational trauma) differentiate the identity status in the period of emergingadulthood. Three identity statuses are distinguished: Identity of anxiety type (N = 23), identity of diffuse type (N = 30) and identity of type achieved (N = 43). Each type differs in terms of both the experiences and the severity of the identity dimensions.",

      "abstract": "Extended family members play an important role in meeting the care needs of autistic individuals, yet family support policies and practices often overlook this role. We aimed to synthesise qualitative research on the role played by extended family members in the lives of autistic individuals and their parents and identify cultural patterns. We searched eight databases and selected relevant studies through a two-stage screening process. We synthesised the results and discussions described in the selected studies using template analysis. The review included 42 studies (40 qualitative; 2 mixed methods), reporting on 1048 parents and 2140 grandparents. While aunts, uncles, cousins were not direct participants, their roles were described in participants’ narratives. Three main themes were developed: (1) types of support from extended family members, including emotional, financial, instrumental, and informational support; (2) unhelpful or lack of support from extended family members, including misunderstanding about autism, absence of support with caregiving, and negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviours against autistic individuals as well as their parents; (3) factors influencing the role of extended family members, including individuals, family unit, family interaction characteristics, a journey towards acceptance and cultural influences. Novel findings on the influence of culture suggested in cultures highly valuing family interdependence, extended relatives play a more prominent support role, yet the emphasis on family reputation might hinder the acceptance of autism by extended relatives. Based on a family systems approach, we recommend priorities for intervention development and clinical practice to support the effective involvement of extended family members.",

There are dramatic differences in the state of knowledge in the various social contexts. In the domain of family of origin, the ability to predict and influence youthful offending is truly impressive. It is approaching causal or functional significance. Forming social attachments is the basis to healthy relationships that could protect a child from a criminal trajectory. Families operate along two dimensions: the relationship and the structuring/normative dimensions. Children who are raised in families in which there is a poor parental relationship and the parents exercise poor parenting techniques are most at risk for delinquency. Family interventions can reduce delinquency. The predictive validity of assessments in the domains of home, school, work, and leisure are impressive. Targeting parent–child relationships and parental structuring skills are associated with positive effects.",

Conversely, in cases of family caring, the household tries to keep up the food diet but we observe transformations that depend on the re-organization of food activities. They vary with the help’s status and age (spouse, son/daughter), and the elderly person’s sex and types of disabilities (physical or psychological).

      "abstract": "With increasing frequency, we are observing the phenomenon of the parentally abandoned or rejected child. This can in large measure be attributed to several social/historical developments in American society (Crandall and Grossberg, 1978). Important factors contributing to the phenomenon include the much publicized \"breakdown\" of traditional family structures; increasing divorce rates; the urbanization of the American population, which creates a cloak of social anonymity; and the establishment of a state/federal welfare bureaucracy, which in part supplants the caretaking functions traditionally carried out by parents. Children who become the victims of parental abandonment find themselves in circumstances in which they come to the attention of an remain, at least for a time, the responsiblity of the legal system and the mental health professions. The interaction of these two institutions, with their overlapping obligations of responsibility toward protecting children, often creates its own problems. Problems arise in part from the somewhat different \"interests\" of children whom the legal and mental health professions seek to protect and in part from a lack of mutual understanding and knowledge concerning the respective goals, duties, and professional obligations of the two professions. By becoming familiar with the complexity of legal issues which surround the topic of intrafamily relationships in general and parental rights in particular, the psychiatric practitioner can anticipate certain problems which might occur during the course of treatment and can in some instances specify conditions or introduce safeguards in order to minimize the impact of legal intrusions upon the treatment program. The following discussion is designed to help the practitioner to achieve these goals.",

      "title": "시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 정신건강 수준에 관한 비교연구",
      "abstract": "[연구배경] 시설보호아동들은 일반가정에 거주하고 있는 비시설호보아동들에 비하여 일반적으로 학업성취동기, 자아존중감, 정서적 조절능력, 이해력과 표현력이 낮고, 상실에 대한 불안감과 우울감, 긍정적인 자아 정체감이 결핍을 보이며, 부모와의 분리로 인해 정서적으로 불안정하고 타인과 안정적인 애착형성에 장애를 갖는다. 또한 낮은 성취동기와 자아개념, 부주의, 산만함, 충동적 성격의 특성을 보이고 자기조절능력이 낮아 문제행동을 유발하는 등 시설보호 아동의 발달이 부정적이라는 연구들이 많은 실정이다. 그러나 시설보호가 반드시 아동에게 부정적인 영향을 주는 것은 아니며, 열악한 환경에서도 역경을 극복하고 이후 성공적으로 적응하는 경우도 찾아 볼 수 있다. 가령 경제적 빈곤, 부모의 이혼, 가정불화 등과 같이 아동이 통제할 수 없거나 다루기 어려운 상황에 직면했을 때, 어떤 아동들은 심각할 정도의 심리적 고통을 경험하고 행동문제를 보이는 반면, 일부 아동은 심리적, 신체적으로 건강한 상태를 유지하면서 학교생활에도 잘 적응한다. 이처럼 적응상의 차이를 보이는 것은 개인마다 스트레스 상황에서 적절하게 대처할 수 있는 다양한 자원들의 이용가능성이 다르기 때문이다. [연구목적] 본 연구는 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 정신건강 위험도, 불안, 우울, 사회적 부적응에 대한 차이를 밝히고, 친구관계·선생님관계·학업성적·건강상태·활동참여도와 정신건강 위험도 간의 상관관계를 분석하여 시설보호아동의 프로그램 운영 및 제도개선의 기초자료를 제공하고자 한다. [연구방법] 본 연구는 서울시에 소재 M 및 H 아동보호시설 및 M 초등학교 4.5.6학년 학생 300명을 대상으로 하였다. 정신건강 수준을 측정하기 위해 영국의 Goldberg가 개발한 정신건강 척도인 General Health Questionnaire(GHQ)를 신선인(2001)이 한국판으로 표준화한 ``한국판 일반정신건강 척도(The Korean General Health Questionnaire, KGHQ-20)``를 사용하여 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 정신건강수준을 비교하였다. 자료처리를 위하여 통계프로그램 SPSS 12.0 버전을 사용하여 아동보호시설과 비아동보호시설 초등학생간의 정신건강 위험도 및 정신건강위험도의 하위요인 점수의 평균과 표준편차를 산출하였고, 집단 간 차이분석을 위하여 독립표본 t-검정을 실시하였고, 집단 내 하위요인의 수준에 따른 정신건강요인의 불안, 우울, 사회적부적응의 차이를 파악하기 위하여 One-way ANOVA를 사용하였다. 그리고 진단별 자기기재 방식에 따른 친구관계·선생님관계·학업성적·건강상태·활동참여도와 정신건강 위험도간의 상관관계를 분석하였다. 통계적 유의수준은 p< .05로 하였다. [연구결과] 두 집단의 정신건강위험도는 시설보호아동의 6.25±4.12보다 일반가정아동이 5.22±3.85로 통계적으로 의미있는 수준(p<.05)에서 낮게 났다. 정신건강위험도의 하위요인인 우울요인(p<.001), 사회적부적응(p<.05)은 통계적으로 유의한 수준에서 일반가정아동이 낮았으며, 불안요인도 일반가정아동이 낮았으나 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보이지는 않았다. 자각인지정도에 따른 정신건강수준에서 시설보호아동은 친구관계와 선생님과의 관계 정도가 좋을수록 정신건강수준에 긍정적인 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났으나 일반가정아동의 경우는 유의한 차이가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 학업성적, 건강상태, 원내활동정도에 따른 정신건강수준은 학업성적, 건강상태, 원내활동참여정도가 좋을수록 정신건강수준에 긍정적인 것으로 나타났으며, 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보였다. 자각인지정도에 따른 정서적 불안수준에서 시설보호아동은 친구관계와 선생님과의 관계 정도가 좋을수록 불안수준에 긍정적인 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났으나 일반가정아동의 경우는 유의한 차이가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 학업성적, 건강상태, 원내활동정도에 따른 불안수준은 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보여 학업성적과 건강상태가 좋고, 원내활동정도가 높을수록 불안의 수준이 낮은 것으로 나타났다. 자각인지정도에 따른 우울수준에서 시설보호아동은 친구관계와 선생님과의 관계 정도가 좋을수록 우울수준이 낮게 나타났으나 일반가정아동의 경우는 유의한 차이가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동의 학업성적, 건강상태, 원내활동정도에 따른 우울수준은 학업성적과 건강상태가 좋고, 원내활동정도가 높을수록 우울수준이 낮은 것으로 나타났으며 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보였다. 자각인지정도에 따른 사회부적응수준은에서 시설보호아동은 친구관계와 선생님과의 관계 정도가 좋을수록 사회적 부적응수준이 낮게 나타났다. 일반가정아동의 경우는 친구관계에 따라서는 유의한 차이가 없는 것으로 나타났으나, 선생님과의 관계가 사회적 부적응에는 큰 영향이 없는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동에서 학업성적과 건강상태가 좋고, 원내활동정도가 높을수록 사회적 부적응수준이 낮은 것으로 나타났으며 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보였다. 특히 시설보호아동의 경우, 원내활동의 참여정도가 높을수록 사회적 부적응 수준도 통계적으로 유의한 차이를 보이며 낮게 나타나 원내활동의 적극적 참여가 사회적응에 도움을 주는 것으로 나타났다. 시설보호아동과 일반가정아동 간의 친구관계·선생님관계·학업성적·건강상태·활동참여 도와 정신건강 간의 상관관계는 시설보호아동이 일반가정아동에 비해 모든 항목에서 보다 높은 수준의 관계를 나타내어 친구 및 사제관계, 학업성적, 건강상태, 원내활동참여정도가 시설보호아동의 정신건강에 더 큰 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났다. 따라서 본 연구의 결과를 비추어 볼 때, 시설보호아동의 정신건강위험도를 줄이기 위하여 시설보호아동들의 상호간 그리고 교사와 아동 간의 관계개선을 위한 다양한 프로그램의 운영이 요구된다. 생활스포츠의 참여는 신체활동의 양을 증가시켜 신체적 건강수준을 향상시킬 뿐 아니라 자아존중감과 정신건강에 도움을 주며 팀 구성원 및 운동참여자 상호간의 친밀감을 향상시키는데 효과적이므로 아동보호시설에서의 체육프로그램의 적극적인 활용이 요구된다.",

      "abstract": "This article highlights the significance of pets for five young women with care experience, examining the impact of disruptions to those relationships when moving into or between care settings. Findings show that pets support the transition to independent living and mental health. Participants’ reflections also reveal how pets are a source of comfort and stability for children growing up in families experiencing difficult circumstances. Loss is therefore traumatic because of the support pets provided and the context surrounding loss. Despite their significance, pets were largely absent from discussions and processes associated with managing care transitions. Adults and perceived constraints in residential care dictated what happened with respect to pets. Neither consulted nor supported, children were left to cope on their own. Attention to pets should be an integral part of the process of managing care transitions and it is imperative that the impact of pet loss (at any stage in children’s lives) is understood and supported. Otherwise, the system may inadvertently foster a perpetual loop of mistrust and relational losses. We consider how some local authorities are starting to manage this process (considering pets in the family or foster carers’ homes), and existing guidance on introducing animals in residential care.",

Institutionelle Bedingungen oder psychosoziale Dynamiken in der pädagogischen Beziehung können jedoch auch bei Sozialarbeiter*innen zu latenten Aggressionen, Distanzierungswünschen oder Abwehr gegenüber den Jugendlichen führen, die den Fachpersonen nicht bewusst sind, die aber einen großen Einfluss auf die Frage des Ankommens der Adressat*innen haben. Dieser Beitrag beschäftigt sich anhand einer tiefenhermeneutischen Interpretation von Datenmaterial aus dem Jugendhilfealltag damit, wie die pädagogische Interaktion bei Jugendlichen und Betreuungspersonen durch eine Doppelbödigkeit gekennzeichnet ist. Es wird gezeigt, wie es nicht nur die Jugendlichen sind, die Schwierigkeiten haben, sich einzulassen, sondern dass auch Sozialarbeiter*innen mit unbewussten Gefühlen von Distanz und Abwehr das Entstehen von Beziehung verhindern können.",

      "abstract": "This discussion of adolescent adaptation to pregnancy and parenthood focuses on both the psychological adjustment of the mother (pregnancy and psychological stress womens fears about pregnancy the effect of body changes on womens feelings and emotional changes due to pregnancy i.e. the effect of emotional changes on relationships and feelings after childbirth); the psychological adjustment of the father (psychological stress and emotional reactions); and special tasks and concerns of adolescent parents (support systems). In general available studies on normative adjustment indicate that while reactions may differ for an individual woman or couple during pregnancy other factors including age of the parents available support systems previous adjustment and parenting experience play significant roles in the process. Emotional disturbances during pregnancy seem to be related to maturational and psychological readiness for the process emotional stability and instability at the time of pregnancy early life experiences the overall social situation and probably the significant hormonal shifts that occur. It has also been found that women experience profound psychological changes during the course of pregnancy and following the birth of their baby with the struggles appearing most profound with a 1st pregnancy. Despite and possibly related to initial enthusiasm about being pregnant and a desire for the baby many women experience fears and concerns about themselves and the unborn baby. In comparison with the available literature on expectant motherhood much less work has been done on expectant fatherhood and little has dealt with the experiences of adolescent fathers. In general the findings of available studies indicate that pregnancy is a crucial time that may contribute to emotional problems in men who may be predisposed because of a variety of developmental and personal circumstances. The clinical and research efforts of the authors concerning the adaptation to fatherhood revealed that most married men experience an initial sense of excitement and pride when they learn that their wives are pregnant. Experience with single and adolescent fathers has been less systematic yet the authors have been impressed that feelings of virility and manliness are important components of the initial complex reaction to the pregnancy. The process of becoming parents is difficult in general. The task for adolescents appears more difficult. The pregnancy and new baby may raise important developmental considerations for young parents. Along with the usual struggles associated with pregnancy and parenthood they may have to deal with difficult psychologic and realistic situations. An important factor contributing to the pressure on adolescent parents is the changes in support systems that have taken place in recent decades.",

Attachment to place is believed to help create a sense of home and maintain self‐identity, supporting successful adjustment to contingencies of ageing. The purpose of this study was to deepen our understanding of processes and strategies by which older people create a sense of home in residential care. Our findings show that a sense of home in residential care involves strategies related to three dimensions of the environment – attachment to place, to space and attachment beyond the institution – and that the circumstances under which older people manage or fail in creating attachment, consist of psychosocial processes involving both individual and shared attitudes and beliefs. Assuming that attachment is important to human existence regardless of age, attention must be paid to optimize the circumstances under which attachment is created in residential care, and how nursing interventions can help speed up this process due to the frail and vulnerable state of most older residents.",

Participants (N = 236) were presented with a number of scenarios depicting the circumstances in which a couple has contracted with a surrogate mother and were asked to indicate the extent to which such a contract may present a moral problem. The scenarios were created by varying four factors: the type of surrogacy (traditional or gestational), the surrogate mother’s level of autonomy, the family context in which the surrogate mother lives, and whether surrogacy was commercial or altruistic. Three qualitatively different personal positions were found: (a) a majority group for which surrogacy always (30%) or often (34%) presents a moral problem, (b) a minority group (14%) for which maternal surrogacy does not systematically present a moral problem, and (c) another minority group (22%) for which circumstances – mainly the mother’s level of autonomy and the family context in which she lives – were completely determining.",

But what is worse, the elderly do not seem to be «object of love» for their children or close family either. Two scenarios have been explored. The first relates to the privileged familiarity, developed in time, with the elder who should be cared for, and whose presence in one’s own emotional life is often ambiguous. The second refers to a new phenomenon: the present generation of fifty/sixty year olds who find themselves again in the role of children whose parents are eighty or older. The combination or clash of these older generations can make the loving care of an elder parent a hard task, easier to delegate to others (retirement homes o care takers).",

      "title": "Enhancing Parent-Provider Relationships and Communication in Infant and Toddler Classrooms",
      "abstract": "Young children develop in the context of their relationships with important others in their environments: parents, child providers, and peers. Moreover, the quality of these relationships has implications for children's adaptation in other contexts. A large body of research, for example, has established the links between attachment relationships with parents and other aspects of children's development (Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson, & Collins, 2005; Thompson, 1999). The focus of the present study is on the relationships between the important adults in a young social world, parents and child providers, and on the effectiveness of an intervention designed to enhance these relationships. Young children's social networks commonly extend beyond their families, to include non-familial caregivers (Burchinal et al., 2000). Over half of children under the of 5 in the United States are cared for in child centers or family child homes, spending a considerable amount of time with other caregivers. Children of employed mothers spend an average of 34 hours per week in such settings (U.S. Department of Education, 2006). Children's relationships with caregivers can play an important role in their development. Similar to parent-child relationships, secure attachments to child providers are linked with greater social competence and more positive peer interactions and more sophisticated play and cognitive development (Hamre & Pianta, 2001; Howes, Hamilton, & Matheson, 1994; Howes, Matheson, & Hamilton, 1994; Pianta & Stuhlman, 2004). Although parent-child relationships generally remain stable, such is not the case for relationships between children and their child providers. In center-based child care, for example, children change providers regularly, as they age out of a classroom. While this is common practice, some research has emphasized the importance of continuity of (Hegde & Cassidy, 2004; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000; Whitebook, Sakai, & Howes, 2004) finding that when children remain with the same providers over several years, they show more attachment-related behavior, more stable attachment to their caregivers (Barnas & Cummings, 1994; Howes & Hamilton, 1992), more socially competent peer interactions (Howes, Hamilton, & Matheson, 1994), and better school adjustment (e.g., fewer behavior problems, less school failure) into the elementary school years (Hofferth, Shauman, Henke & West, 1998; Howes, 1988; Howes & Hamilton, 1992). Essa, Favre, Thweatt, and Waugh (1999) asserted that continuity of is especially important for infants and toddlers: One of the most important needs of infants and toddlers is for regular, predictable caregiving which allows [them] to develop a special relationship with a familiar adult. Taking away a consistent caregiver during the first 2 or 3 years of life compromises the sense of trust, the process of separation and the formation of a stable identity (p. 12). Continuity of also may play an important role in the development of relationships between child providers and parents. Essa and her colleagues (1999) asserted When the child remains with the same teacher for a 3-year period ... trust and mutual respect [between parents and teachers] not only continue but grow (p. 15). Further, parent-provider relationships play an important role in young children's development and experiences in child care. As Owen, Ware, and Barfoot (2000) stated, the child's quality of experience in each environment may be enhanced when parent and child-care provider bridge the distance between the two social worlds of child and home and work together as partners in the care (p. 426). Research on parent-provider relationships in child largely stems from Bronfenbrenner's (2001) ecological systems theory, which views children's development as a product of the interactions that take place within the multiple environments in which they live. …",

      "title": "Co-Parenting in the Context of Divorce: Evaluation and Application of the Multidimensional Co-Parenting Scales for Dissolved Relationships",
      "abstract": "The experience of divorce can be a complex and challenging experience, particularly for families with minor children. Divorce intrinsically facilitates several related transitions that can include changes in financial circumstances, residence or geographic location, and various interpersonal relationships. Among the most drastic changes in relationships during this time can be the relationship between former spouses. Divorce may terminate the romantic relationship among partners, but for those with shared children, the joint responsibility in childrearing remains. How parents relate to each other in the capacity of childrearing is what is referred to as the co-parenting relationship. Within the divorce literature, limited research exists which considers comprehensive parent-reports of a range of co-parenting behaviors that are typical within the literature on co-parenting among continuously married intact families. This dissertation built upon this gap in the literature to advance understanding of a new measure of co-parenting behaviors among parents who have experienced a relationship dissolution. This measure, the Multidimensional Co-parenting Scales for Dissolved Relationships (MCS-DR), consists of four scales: (1) support, (2) overt conflict, (3) internally-regulated covert conflict, and (4) externally-regulated covert conflict. Support and overt conflict are commonly assessed dimensions within the divorce literature. However, internally-regulated covert conflict and externally-regulated covert conflict represent an understudied set of behaviors that distinguish between actions that an individual parent controls themselves and behaviors that fall outside of their control. Using this measure as a vehicle, the two studies herein sought to better understand (1) the utility of measuring covert co-parenting conflict in the divorce literature, (2) how physical custody status, a critical component of the post-divorce experience, can influence or shape the experience of co-parenting, and (3) what leverage points exist that can help to alleviate the impact of post-divorce stress on individual wellbeing. Study 1 involved the assessment of the MCS-DR for measurement equivalence across three distinctive physical custody statuses. Results indicated that nonresident parents and parents who shared joint custody demonstrated similar measurement related to factor loadings and intercept-levels across all four scales of the MCS-DR. Post-hoc tests were conducted to examine measurement equivalence between resident parents and a combined group of nonresident parents and joint custody parents. Findings suggested that although factor loadings were similar across all constructs, only internally-regulated covert conflict demonstrated similar intercept-levels across each custody group. Study 2 involved the assessment of competing models, comparing the well-established Quality of Coparental Communication Scale (QCCS) and the MCS-DR in predicting a latent variable of adverse mental health symptomology. Using a stress process approach, each…",

      "title": "Family care-giving and living arrangements of functionally impaired elders in rural China",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT China has seen a rapid decline of the traditional multi-generational household and an increase in rural-to-urban migration, raising concerns about a possible breakdown of the informal support system. Against this background, the paper looks at family care-giving (or the absence thereof) to parents in three different living arrangements: with any child or child-in-law (co-resident); independent with at least one child living in the same community (networked); and without any children in either the household or the community (isolated). It also compares the care-giving arrangements of single elders to those living with a spouse. The sample, which is derived from the comprehensive China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), contains data on 887 functionally impaired individuals aged 60 and above. The findings suggest that married parents are mostly cared for by their spouse, even if they co-reside with adult children. Proximity to children is particularly important for single elders, who are more likely to lack a care-giver when living independently. There appears to be a hierarchy in family care responsibilities, where children step in as care-givers only when the spouse is no longer able to fulfil this role. While these findings imply a significant deviation from traditional practices and norms of ‘filial piety’, they can be interpreted as a rational adaptation to the changed economic circumstances in rural China.",

      "abstract": "Little is known about how severe anorexia nervosa (AN) in youths affects siblings and siblings' experiences of family-based treatment for AN. Thirteen youths (M age = 15.5 years, SD = 3.0; 23% boys) who had been co-admitted with their sibling with AN and parents at an inpatient clinic for eating disorders 3 to 6 years earlier participated in qualitative interviews. Interviews were analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results showed AN is difficult to understand, particularly at onset, and is associated with confusion and lack of information for siblings. AN evokes difficult emotions, including fears of death, frustration about rigid behavior, and sadness about changed life situations. AN affects family dynamics and relations, including conflicts and disruptions at home, limited and divided family life, and less attention from parents and extended family. Siblings pay attention to other people eating habits, strive for a balanced view on eating, and experience family meals as conflictual. Siblings experience increased knowledge and personal development, and are ambivalent to family treatment. Ways of coping include creating distance, seeking social support, rationalizing, and keeping hope. In conclusion, siblings' experiences of severe AN are complex and ambiguous. Family-based treatment for AN in young people should address siblings' perspectives.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper draws on a 1980 sample survey of middle-aged and elderly residents of a medium-sized Canadian city ( N = 464). Few parents and grown-up children discussed in advance what might happen should parents become seriously ill or unable to look after themselves. However, most respondents did feel these matters should be discussed in advance, and most felt that parents should be the ones to raise these issues. This was true for both the middle-aged and the elderly. Elderly men rarely discussed their wives' futures with their children. Both the middle-aged and the elderly rarely talked with siblings or friends about the possibility of their own or their parents' dependency. Discussions that took place were often precipitated by illness. However, children expressed a great deal of concern for parents, especially for older parents. A variety of possible contributing explanations are suggested. These range from unwillingness to acknowledge changing family structure and mortality to parents' view on non-family-provided services.",

      "abstract": "Bullying adalah pola perilaku, bukan insiden yang terjadi sekali-kali. Anak-anak yang melakukan bullying biasanya berasal dari status sosial atau posisi kekuasaan yang lebih tinggi, seperti anak-anak yang lebih besar, lebih kuat, atau dianggap populer sehingga dapat menyalahgunakan posisinya. Anak-anak yang paling rentan menghadapi risiko lebih tinggi untuk di-bully sering kali adalah anak-anak yang berasal dari masyarakat yang terpinggirkan, anak-anak dari keluarga berpenghasilan rendah, anak-anak dengan penampilan atau ukuran tubuh yang berbeda, anak-anak penyandang di sabilitas, atau anak-anak migran dan pengungsi. Bullying dapat menimbulkan dampak yang berbahaya dan jangka panjang bagi anak-anak. Selain efek fisik dari bullying, anak-anak dapat mengalami masalah kesehatan mental dan emosional, termasuk depresi dan kecemasan, yang dapat menyebabkan penyalahgunaan narkoba dan penurunan prestasi di sekolah. Jika hal-hal ini terus dibiarkan dalam tatanan kehidupan mereka maka akan mengakibatkan pelaku tumbuh menjadi pelaku kriminal atau sosok penguasa yang tak punya empati terhadap orang lain. Pelaku bullying akan menganggap bahwa cara penyelesaian masalah yang paling baik adalah dengan cara-cara kekerasan atau pelaku beranggapan dengan mengintimidasi orang lain maka akan memenuhi keinginannya. Hal ini akan mendorong sifat premanisme yang akan terbawa hingga dewasa dan mengakibatkan ketidak nyamanan di masyarakat. Untuk itu pola asuh anak juga sangat mempengaruhi kepribadian anak. Pola asuh ini akan menentukan bagaimana anak berinteraksi dengan orang tuanya.",

      "title": "Resolutions: Working with Families Where Responsibility for Abuse is Denied",
      "abstract": "Current thinking suggests that little productive work can be undertaken with families where serious physical or sexual abuse of children has occurred in the absence of a clear acceptance of responsibility for that abuse. This means that children are often removed from their families because of the perceived risks, with the disadvantages that being looked after in local authority care often brings. Alternatively, children may be left in the same environment where serious abuse has taken place with little or no work being undertaken with the family. Either approach fails children, especially those who have made clear and believable allegations in the hope of bringing about a process of change and protection. This article describes the work of a pilot project at the Avon NSPCC in Bristol working with families where the alleged abuser disputes responsibility for maltreating the child. Key to this approach is the support of the non-abusing carer and the child/ren while the concerns of the professional agencies are addressed. The work has two main phases. The first looks for structural change in the organization of family life. The second part asks carers to role-play a ‘similar’ hypothetical family where child abuse has been established. This enables difficult issues raised by the abuse to be addressed and provides an opportunity for carers to express thoughts and feelings to their partner regarding abuse without the seriousness of the concerns being lost.",

Working recursively through the six guidelines of ambiguous loss (finding meaning, tempering mastery, reconstructing identity, normalizing ambivalence, revising attachment, and discovering hope), I use reflexive personal narrative to describe the impact of a child’s psychological presence but physical absence on a nonbiological parent. Three themes are identified: (a) naming the problem—the loss of our family unit, (b) the paradox of presence and absence—fractured parent‐child ties, and (c) recursive discovery of meaning and hope. Implications for practice include the following: (a) applying ambiguous loss to nonlegal relational loss, (b) public policy—the right to same‐gender divorce, and (c) telling our stories as transformative practice.",

A influencia do contexto no qual os (as) adolescentes se desenvolvem, tanto no que diz respeito a familia quanto no que concerne ao ambiente macro social, associada as caracteristicas de imaturidade emocional, impulsividade e comportamento desafiador que de forma geral estao presentes na fase da adolescencia podem resultar no engajamento em comportamentos considerados de risco, como por exemplo, a iniciacao sexual cada vez mais cedo e a ausencia de protecao durante o ato sexual (PeNSE 2015; PRATTA; SANTOS, 2007).

      "title": "Patterns of Relitigation in the Postdivorce Family",
      "abstract": "The involvement of divorcing families with the court system is commonly thought to be transient, ending with the ratification of the terms of the divorce, and, subsequently, with divorce itself. This is the case with some families, whose involvement is limited to legal endorsement of their divorce agreement. For other families, involvement is intense and enduring and often extends many years into the postdivorce period. Litigation (defined here as the filing of any type of motion in connection with a divorce) has been linked, in several ways, with poor outcome for parents and children, and is, therefore, a cause for concern. The actual process of litigating can be problematic, causing discomfort for parents (Spanier & Anderson, 1979), intensifying destructive conflict (Emery, Hetherington, & DiLalla, 1984), and increasing the psychological maladjustment of children (Saayman & Saayman, 1989). Litigation is often an index of interparental conflict and/or poor communication, and a consistent predictor of poor adjustment, low self-esteem, and behavior problems for children (e.g., Camara & Resnick, 1989; Johnston, Campbell, & Mayes, 1985; Steinman, Zemmelman, & Knoblauch, 1985). We have chosen to focus on the period of litigation after divorce, referred to here as relitigation, because it can be particularly troublesome for families. Although some families return to court to ratify extant informal arrangements, or to institute legal changes to which both parents have agreed, we expect that relitigation under nonconflictual conditions is relatively rare. Returning to court for resolution of custody, visitation, and child support issues often indicates that parents are unable to adhere to extant arrangements for their children, or that the arrangements are unsatisfactory. In many cases, it also suggests considerable and enduring interparental conflict. The relitigation process can be lengthy and arduous, sometimes lasting until children have graduated from college. During this time, the parents and, particularly, the children have no relief from the divorce process. Parents remain under stress and unsettled, and children remain uncertain about the basic structure of their daily lives. We know little about the characteristics of postdivorce litigation and the families who engage in it. Litigation has rarely been the primary object of investigation. When considered, it is most often used to measure the success of custody arrangements (Ilfeld, Ilfeld, & Alexander, 1982; Leupnitz, 1986; Steinman et al., 1985), mediation (Bahr, 1981), or divorce-related counseling (Irving et al., 1981). Litigation has also been used as an index of conflict in divorcing families (Ash & Guyer, 1986). These diverse, and sometimes tangential, sources of available information yield data that are largely inconsistent and not often generalizable. Data are often limited to clinical samples, or to a specific type of family (e.g., those with joint legal or physical custody). The most basic aspects of litigation, such as its volume and content, have been largely ignored. The longitudinal picture also remains unclear; divorcing families are usually followed for only short periods of time, from 1 year (Steinman et al., 1985) to 2 years (Ash & Guyer, 1986; Cline & Westman, 1971). Pre- and postdivorce litigation are not consistently differentiated. GOALS, RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AND HYPOTHESES The main objective of relitigation research should be to determine its effects on families, particularly children. Documentation is a first step. Although the scope of this study is limited to information in the court records, we begin this documentation process, presenting an overview of the scope and specifics of postdivorce litigation. We concentrate on areas of greatest relevance to children of divorce--custody, visitation, and child support. We explore five research questions and associated hypotheses. …",

This process involves three overlapping and often simultaneously occurring factors: (1) the reasons the children's parents were unable to care for them; (2) the caregiver's motivation for assuming responsibility for the child; and (3) the pathways or routes that children took to the caregiver's home. Understanding these factors and their mutual and simultaneous influence is important as we shape policies, programs and interventions to support families as they consider whether to care for a relative's child and once they assume this responsibility.",

The authors argue that research, policy and practice shaped by administrative categories and/or a preoccupation with risk can overlook the everyday concerns of family life and the ways adults and young people experience, understand, change and maintain their family contexts. Where “ordinary\" experience is ‘troubled’ in public discourse, these contested definitions may result in services being viewed as a potential threat to families, rather than a support to maintain everyday normality. For example, disabled parents’ support needs are sometimes overshadowed by a policy and practice concern to protect young carers from the damaging consequences of their responsibilities. A more normalized experience of care is highlighted in the context of the family, while underlining how access to resources plays a central role in mediating all family troubles.",

      "abstract": "The authors investigated the sources of age-stereotype multidimensionality with the help of personal everyday statements that differed with respect to life domain (e.g., family and partnership vs financial matters) and the adjective dimension reflected in the behavior (e.g., autonomous vs instrumental behavior).A total of 368 statements reflecting autonomy-, instrumentality-, or integrity-related behaviors in five different life domains were generated. Sixty-nine younger (18-26 years) and 74 older (60-84 years) participants rated the typicality of each statement for either a \"young adult\" or an \"old adult.\"Occurrence and direction of age stereotypes varied by life domain and adjective dimension and ultimately depended on the specific combination of both factors (i.e., a significant interaction). For example, old adults were expected to be optimistic about religious aspects but not about their health, fitness, and appearance.The findings highlight the multidimensionality and complexity of age stereotypes based on a wide array of personal everyday statements.",

      "title": "Family Subsystems and Children's Self-Regulation",
      "abstract": "The family context plays a critical role in the early development of both normative and psychopathological outcomes (Cummings, Davies, & Campbell, 2000). Parents can be sensitive to their child's needs and express warmth in their interactions, or they can engage in intrusive, rejecting behavior that undermines the child's well-being. Similarly, married couples can communicate effectively, engage in mutual problem solving, and enjoy humorous exchanges, or they can get embroiled in coercive cycles of escalating conflict that can easily end with domestic violence. Fathers may be involved or psychologically unavailable. As these examples attest, the family is composed of a number of family subsystems (e.g., mother-child, marital, father-child, sibling) that can affect the development of children's self-regulation. The interplay among these different subsystems can alter developmental trajectories depending on whether family relationships act as risk or protective factors. For instance, the adverse consequences of marital conflict (a risk) may be buffered or dampened if the child has a close and supportive relationship with one parent in the family (a protective factor). In a two-parent family, the mother-child and father-child relationships can be concordant (both warm and sensitive) or discordant (one warm, one rejecting), and these differences within concordant and discordant families have consequences for the children involved.",

(c) There are several types of care: help with regular daily needs, important occasional needs (visits to the doctor), and help with expenses for caregiving services. (d) There are alternative motives for providing care that may have different implications for public policy, but that are difficult to distinguish empirically: altruism on the one hand, and exchange on the other hand: care services provided today for a monetary inheritance to be received in the future or inter vivos transfers received in the past, present, or future.",

Guided by stress process and health behavior models, we analyzed semi-structured interviews with 120 family caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) in rural Appalachia to explore personal/family circumstances that influence the responsibilities nonlineal kin assumed to meet the needs of PwD. Compared to spouse and adult children caregivers, nonlineal caregivers reported that PWD had similar behavioral problems, but greater ADL limitations. They also expressed greater burden, overload and role captivity; yet, they reported higher personal mastery, and perseverance. Although sisters and nieces did not report using any paid services to care for PwD, grandchildren and fictive kin used paid services such as meal delivery, personal care, and respite services. Findings provide new insights into a more elaborated conception of caregiving that considers the transformations occurring in family life today.",

      "title": "The Development of Children Ages 6 to 14",
      "abstract": "The years between 6 and 14--middle childhood and early adolescence--are a time of important developmental advances that establish children's sense of identity. During these years, children make strides toward adulthood by becoming competent, independent, self-aware, and involved in the world beyond their families. Biological and cognitive changes transform children's bodies and minds. Social relationships and roles change dramatically as children enter school, join programs, and become involved with peers and adults outside their families. During middle childhood, children develop a sense of self-esteem and individuality, comparing themselves with their peers. They come to expect they will succeed or fail at different tasks. They may develop an orientation toward achievement that will color their response to school and other challenges for many years. In early adolescence, the tumultuous physical and social changes that accompany puberty, the desire for autonomy and distance from the family, and the transition from elementary school to middle school or junior high can all cause problems for young people. When adolescents are in settings (in school, at home, or in community programs) that are not attuned to their needs and emerging independence, they can lose confidence in themselves and slip into negative behavior patterns such as truancy and school dropout. This article examines the developmental changes that characterize the years from 6 to 14, and it highlights ways in which the organization of programs, schools, and family life can better support positive outcomes for youths.",

      "abstract": "Betrayed partners experience a great amount of changes, losses, and grief following the discovery of an extramarital affair. The following study examines the stories of two women and four men from various areas across the United States who were the betrayed partner in a marriage that experienced extramarital affairs. A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews were conducted to obtain information to answer the following research question: What are the betrayed partner’s experiences with grief and loss following the discovery of an extramarital affair within their marriage? Several themes arose from the findings including: 1) immediate thoughts, feelings, and behaviors such as shock, confusion, anger, and disbelief, 2) wanting to fix the relationship using counseling and salvaging the relationship, 3) life alterations caused by the affair including increase in self-esteem, not wanting to marry again, having to continue interactions with the betrayer, learning that not everyone is untrustworthy, emotional instability, and legal action, 4) grief and loss including loss of the relationship, divorce, shared custody of the children, loss of their partner’s family, loss of friends, shattered dreams and expectations, physical and emotional losses, loss of trust, adjusting to being primary custody provider, and financial hardships. Participants identified several coping strategies such as: family, religion, friends, individual counseling, reading books, granting forgiveness, and attending support groups. This study provides a broad look at the losses and grief, which are often times overlooked aspects of infidelity.

      "abstract": "It is objected that the positions taken by child liberators would add to the rights of children by increasing the responsibilities of their elders, and sacrifice the welfare of children to their presumed rights. To grant that children should have all the rights now possessed by adults contradicts four propositions which have gained wide popular and scientific support: (a) children undergo successive qualitative transformations requiring commensurate changes in social status as they pass from one stage of development to the next; (b) children are inferior to adults in the competencies required to survive independently and therefore require special protection; (c) self‐determination in adulthood is a product of maturation and not a gift bestowed by permissive caretakers; and (d) adult authority properly exercised in the early years is positively related to later independence. The ethically insupportable feature of the children's liberation movement is its failure to acknowledge that dependent status precludes possession of the full rights of the emancipated person. The principle of reciprocity in parent‐child relations is thereby rejected, and indeed, adults are expected to assume new duties so that children may exercise new rights.",

Yet, we know little about how older adults' marital status may influence their support exchanges with different social partners in everyday life, and whether the effect of support exchanges on daily well-being vary by marital status. Adults aged 65+ (N = 278) completed an initial interview about their background and close social networks; then, participants reported whether they provided or received support from their close social partners and rated their psychological well-being for 5 to 6 days. Multilevel logistic models revealed that married older adults were more likely to provide or receive daily support from their close partners than widowed or divorced older adults. However, with respect to specific non-spousal ties, married older adults were less likely to provide support to siblings, friends or others (acquaintances, neighbors) compared to divorced older adults. Although married older adults were more likely to receive support from children than divorced older adults, they were less likely to receive support from siblings and friends compared to widowed or divorced older adults. Furthermore, receiving support from other familial ties (grandchild, other relatives) was associated with reduced daily well-being for widowed older adults whereas married older adults were able to maintain their daily well-being in such situation. Findings highlight the central role siblings and friends play in unmarried older adults' daily support networks and suggest that receiving support could have differential impact on daily well-being depending on older adults’ marital status.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The differences in structures of constructs of joint regulation of behavior and dynamics of family cohesion were demonstrated on the example of marital dyads, waiting for the 1st and 2nd child, and thus being at different stages of family life cycle. It was found that the tendency to over-unity is typical for the families waiting the 1st baby. And it is associated with less coordinated structures of joint regulation of behavior. The marital dyads waiting for the 2nd baby tend to diminish interpersonal distance more seldom. So the structure of their joint behavioral regulation is more coherent.",

      "abstract": "The last 25 years have seen a significant shift in the type of children being adopted. Up until the late 1970s, the majority of children placed for adoption were young babies. Their mothers, typically unmarried, felt unable to care for them for a variety of reasons, including lack of financial support, stigma and social pressure. Most children adopted today have been placed at older ages from the public care system. Their pre-placement histories are often ones of neglect, abuse and trauma. Judgments have been made that their parents could not or should not care for them. Although some children show extraordinary levels of resilience in the face of early adversity, many suffer a range of developmental, emotional and behavioural impairments, which they bring with them when placed with adoptive families. Although recent evidence has shown that social workers are skilled at recognizing which prospective adopters are likely to be the most sensitive carers, even the most responsive of parents find that looking after children who have suffered severe maltreatment can be demanding, puzzling and unexpectedly difficult. Post-adoption support workers and therapists who base their practice on developmental attachment theory recognize that all children generate behavioural strategies to help them function in relationships with their primary caregivers. Out of these relationship experiences, children build ‘inner working models’ or ‘mental representations’ of what to expect of themselves and others, particularly at times of need and stress.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Communication and social preadaptation have interpretative problems in early interaction. Both have strong teleological commitment and are not therefore wholly appropriate. The mother‐infant system gradually achieves the hallmark of true teleology largely because the mother acts as if the newborn's foetal‐like behaviour had communicative significance. Viewing newborn behaviour as such is compatible with the biological principle of preadaptation which avoids vague assumptions about early behaviour being socially ‘prewired’. It is recommended that the mother be given an observer's role as it may lead to a useful methodology for understanding early communication. Studying deviancy in early relationships is also considered.",

      "abstract": "Ha habido dos estudios sobre apego en familias de riesgo social que han seguido a sus infantes hasta el final de la adolescencia. Han surgido varios hallazgos clave relacionados con resultados de interes para los psicoanalistas. En primer lugar, los datos provenientes de ambos estudios indican que las conductas de apego desorganizado durante la infancia son importantes precursores de sintomatologia disociativa posterior. En segundo lugar, esta vulnerabilidad temprana se relaciona con patrones de comunicacion afectiva entre padres e infante, especialmente con las conductas mas silenciosas como la indisponibilidad emocional o la inversion de roles, y no parece residir unicamente en el infante. Finalmente, los resultados sugieren que la calidad de la relacion de apego puede explicar en parte por que algunas personas expuestas a un trauma posterior desarrollan sintomas disociativos mientras que otras no lo hacen. Parafraseando a Dori Laub (1993), la observacion sin reconocimiento por parte de la madre en la infancia puede constituir una condicion previa para el reconocimiento o la falta del mismo por parte de su hijo/a al final de la adolescencia. Sin embargo, sigue sin estar claro si la relacion temprana es predictiva debido principalmente a la aparicion de un proceso defensivo interno durante la infancia o si su poder de prediccion reside principalmente en hacer perdurar los patrones de dialogo padres-hijo/a que refuerzan continuamente los contenidos mentales contradictorios y segregados del nino.",

      "abstract": "Important development in the knowledge of migration, forced migration and asylum-seeking, its association with psychological trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as in the intergenerational legacies of trauma in the family, have occurred in recent years. Trauma must be considered within a culture, because it is the cultural context that shapes the life experiences including the ones that are considered traumatic. Certainly migration has an impact on the family and a massive interference in the child’s psychological development and mental health, which can be severe if related to acculturative stress or traumatic states. Young infants can develop insecure, ambivalent, or disorganized attachment; their lack of basic trust in their surroundings can result in negative effects in their exploratory behavior and autonomy, which may be reflected in disorganized behavior. Older children and adolescents may present increased externalized aggressive behavior and/or internalized anxiety and depressive behavior. Therefore, the models for trauma treatment in childhood must integrate the individual’s actual psychological development with elements of the original and host cultures, including societal belief systems, community, neighborhood, family, and individual aspects. The way these elements interrelate and the risk and protective factors related to the child’s resilience and psychological resources to overcome primary or secondary traumas must also be taken into account, are discussed in depth in this article.",

It presents elements of the concept of a\r\nfamily as a system, which includes a closed or open family\r\ndynamic, the setting and maintaining of clear limits and the\r\nadjustment thereof as the child grows older, the transfer of\r\nfamily patterns through upbringing, and the strong influence\r\nof parents on the formation of values and identity. The\r\nempirical segment contains an overview of the biographies\r\nof three adolescents. The first exemplifies a positive family\r\ninfluence which has contributed to a balanced psychosocial\r\ndevelopment of the adolescent in these tumultuous times.\r\nThe second reveals a series of traumatizing experiences which\r\nhave impeded normal development and have resulted in a\r\nlevel of stress that the adolescent cannot cope with. The\r\nthird displays the effects of growing up without being constrained\r\nby limits and of lesser parental involvement which have resulted in the adolescent’s engaging in a string of dissocial\r\nexperiences and actions which conflict with his social\r\nenvironment. These conflicts stem from a lack of internalized\r\nlimits and boundaries, and a deviant value system.

Por distintas causas hay niños y adolescentes que interactúan con sus compañeros de forma abusiva, acosándoles y sometiéndoles.

The aid sought by the family from the professional worker is not that of counselling, but of corroboration and continuation of existing family values. The premature death wish of the family for the ill aged parent is a reflection of similar feelings within the family prior to the parental illness and impending death. The crisis of parental illness does not substantially alter family patterns of behavior. However, family maladaptive processes, including the denial and distortion of reality regarding the parental illness, constitute a defense mechanism. This defense presumably is for the preservation of a long‐standing pattern of family homeostasis, whether normative or pathologic.",

      "abstract": "This research is based on an participant observation and more than one hundred semi-directed interviews of prisoners, ex-convicts and the prisoners family members based upon questions about intimacy, family relations and sexuality. Family adjustments to the constraints of incarceration alter during a prison sentence, depending on the type of offence/crime and the individual and collective (social, cultural, economic, etc.) resources. Incarceration's palpable effects on the prisoners and relative's intimacy and sexuality reveal the prison's social function (despite its humanization) contradicting with the principle of individual punishment. The survey also deals with prison socialization (doing time) setting the prisoner aside from his relatives because the family often consider delinquency the main cause for the punishment and are then stigmatized with guilt by association with the convict : family links break through the family's reaction for self-preservation. Asked to show his ability to be released from prison, the prisoner's best guarantee for sucessful rehabilitation is with relatives. Despite the shock of stigmatization and lack of consideration by the prison system, prisoners families are, however, forced to create family solidarity.",

The research did not reveal any different behavioural patterns between cohabiting and married couples. Financial support provided by own parents or partner's parents and the presence of small children constituted positive factors which intensified the frequency of contacts and improved the quality of the relationship. In the event of illness of a parent, both the married and cohabiting couples provided assistance, especially when the illness was not disabling and there were no other kin relatives. When this was not possible, a private caregiver was hired or close family members provided assistance. Only those respondents who cohabited with a partner awaiting divorce were less willing to maintain contacts with their partner's parents. The presence of a family formed by previously married partners and the old age of the parents of the latter compromised the quality of the relationship and the willingness to provide assistance.Keywords: intergenerational solidarityfamily exchangesmarriagecohabitationparent–child relations Notes on contributorMonica Santoro is assistant professor at the University of Milan.

      "abstract": "When one of the older parents starts to require intensive and lasting care, to a certain extent an anomic situation will arise in the older family, between children and parents as well as between the children themselves. There is some kind of ambivalence between the generations within the kinship system, which can also be shown historically. It is possible that this ambivalence may even be enlarged by recent structural and cultural developments within the kinship system. Based on a family crisis model a lack of clarity within the older family is shown as to the expectations and obligations to each other. The spiral of the failing competence of the family to handle the care question mostly has its roots in the anomic situation surrounding the organisation of the care activities. To support our anomy hypothesis some problems in taking care of the older parents are analyzed; how they are looked at and handled by the children and how they are negotiated by the parents. Open interviews and some cases are the basis for this analysis and some conclusions in handling the anomic situation are presented.",

In the light of this growing awareness of the child's own attitudes and individual needs, it is recognized that if the period spent in institution or foster home is to benefit the child, it must be related to his whole life experience. Provision for institutional and foster home care are thus seen to be complementary, with one or the other type selected as serving the needs of a particular child, while either must be regarded as supplementary to the efforts made to preserve the child's own family life. As this philosophy is becoming more widely applied, it is found that in many instances placement need not be made, and that the child who must be placed may return home sooner than in the past, if effort has been put forth to rebuild the home life in his absence.",

      "abstract": "Continual and/or repetitive informal caring and the part childhood, developmental and socially constructed identity play roles in adult informal care, form the background to the questions of why individuals gravitate toward such relationships and why they often continue to care in the face of overwhelming obstacles. A synthesis of the literature is presented, leading to personal histories as a method of discovery. The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method’s minimalist interview technique is put forth as the key data‐gathering event. Reflecting teams, underpinned by hermeneutics or interpretive phenomenology, are used for the analyses. Data from in‐depth, biographic interviews with two informal carers (a mother and her adult son) from a seven‐member, three‐generational family are presented. The study reveals that this family defines disability as a status that they share in common: disability demonstrates relationships and keeps the family together, but discourages mobility. It is suggested that often‐unmet childhood needs propelled these particular individuals into demonstrating those needs as adults by assuming informal care relationships. The case is made that their biographies impact upon their management of health and enduring illnesses within caring roles. Further biographic research within the caring profession is recommended.",

A survivor with children may encounter even greater barriers in protecting herself and her children from an ex-partner. These barriers are especially insidious because they take the form of \"no-win\" situations or \"traps.\" If she stays she may be accused of \"failing to protect\" her children from violence and then faces more violence, yet leaving means facing the risk of stalking, harassment and more abuse. Reporting threats or violence to authorities or being reluctant to co-parent means she goes against the \"friendly parent\" standard used to award custody. She also risks being accused of making false allegations of abuse or being labeled as an \"alienator,\" causing \"parental alienation syndrome\" in her child. We illustrate such traps with survivors' own words among those who experience very negative custody or visitation outcomes. Implications are made for professional practice and policy reform.",

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of 209 families at psychosocial risk from the Algarve. We used the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule, the scale of Social Support for Stressful Life Situations, the Parental Sense of Competence, the Inventory of Stressful and Risk Situations, and a sociodemographic questionnaire. Results showed that the majority of participants lived under a precarious economic and occupational situation, and had a low educational level. In the last three years, they had suffered an important amount of stressful life events which have had a high emotional impact on them. They referred to be in a greater need for emotional support than other types of social support. Workers from institutions were seldom mentioned as a source of social support. However, there are some characteristics that may be considered as protective factors, such as a moderate sense of parental efficacy and satisfaction with the parenting role, a normative social support network size and the family structure, stability and size.\nWe discuss their main support needs and the intervention areas that should be taken into account by professionals.",

      "abstract": "Having children at advanced parental age (APA), is becoming more and more common, but research on the lived experiences of children with APA parents is very limited. To investigate this topic, we conducted an explorative interview study in Switzerland. Participants had at least one parent that was at least 40 years old at the time of their birth and we interviewed them about the experiences and meaning of growing up with older parents. After engaging in thematic analysis, our results show that children of APA parents realize that their parents' age does not fit the social norm, and they reveal how they experience, give meaning and adapt to this situation. We identified three circumstances wherein participants realized that their parent was of advanced age: (1) making sense of the differences to others; (2) missing relationship(s); and (3) experiencing atypical generational intervals. Following the realization, participants engaged in two adaptations looking at the future: (1) adjusting to the possibility of an early parental loss; and (2) (re)thinking one's own family building. We conclude by considering these findings in the broader discussion about the phenomenon of APA and the impact of social norms on family building.",

      "title": "Toward a Theory of Permanent Environmental Reassignment for Residential Childcare: A Comprehensive Research Agenda for the 21st Century",
      "abstract": "Historically there have been two residential childcare institutions in Armenia: orphanages and special boarding schools. The children housed in these facilities are either natural orphans (i.e., children who have no living family or whose biological parents have had their familial rights terminated) or social orphans (i.e., children with living biological parents who are unable or unwilling to care for them but whose rights have not been terminated). In recent years, Armenia’s “transitional centers” have offered a residential alternative for older teenage girls who have outgrown the traditional orphanage but who are not yet ready for independent living. While institutionalization has historically been castigated as contrary to a child’s best interests, our previous research suggests that residential childcare facilities (RCF) provide vulnerable children with a safe haven during times of crisis, a loving environment through intimate relationships with staff and peers, emotional stability during formative years, an improved standard of living, and superior opportunities upon reaching the age of majority. These transitional centers, invaluable to the continuum of care, suggest that permanent environmental reassignment is the ideal path when familial care is surrendered or expropriated.",

      "abstract": "Middle-aged adults engage in support exchanges with generations above and below. This study investigated (a) how support to one generation is associated with support to the other and (b) factors accounting for whether parents or offspring receive more support in a family. Middle-aged adults aged 40–60 years (N = 633) completed telephone interviews regarding their relationships and support exchanges with each grown child and living parent. Multilevel models revealed that most participants provided more support to the average grown child than to the average parent. Yet, a proportion of the sample reversed this pattern, providing more support to parents. Mediation models revealed that middle-aged adults provided greater support to offspring because they viewed offspring as more important than parents and offspring had greater everyday needs (e.g., being a student, not married). Parental disability accounted for greater support to parents. Discussion integrates solidarity theory, developmental stake, and contingency theory. Most middle-aged adults provide more to grown offspring than to parents, consistent with their greater stake in their progeny. Middle-aged adults also respond to crises (i.e., parental disability) and everyday needs (i.e., offspring student status) in providing intergenerational support, in accordance with contingency theory.",

Background Family relationships change shortly after divorce, yet little research has examined coparental interaction and father involvement shortly after divorce and overt and covert conflict are often not included. Method Mothers and fathers from different families in a southeastern state ( N = 194) participated within 3 months after divorce (Time 1) and 3 to 6 months later (Time 2). A cross‐lagged structural equation model was used to examine reciprocal associations among dimensions of coparental interaction and father involvement. Results Higher father engagement and lower overt conflict (Time 1) were associated with higher cooperation (Time 2). Covert conflict was associated with later overt conflict. In‐kind support was not associated with later father engagement or coparental interaction. No reciprocal associations among variables were found. Conclusion Coparental conflict and father engagement may be salient to the development of later coparental relationships following divorce. Implications Practitioners can help parents manage conflict and encourage father engagement to foster healthy coparental relationships after divorce.",

Care agreements, on their face, may have real attractions for older adults who wish to stay in the family home and to meet increasing needs for care and companionship through compensation to an intimate as opposed to a professional stranger. Fear of institutional care (the nursing home) is a major motivation. Despite this superficial attraction, however,serious negative consequences may arise, especially where the agreement is informal and vague in terms (as is very often the case).

      "abstract": "THE life cycle of the family may be thought of as the sequence of realignments of family structure and relationships ranging from the time of marriage through the death of one or both partners. In a stable society, such a sequence remains relatively fixed. A body of cultural norms related to appropriate family organization and intra-family relationships develops. Obligations, responsibilities, and privileges appropriate to each phase of the family cycle become established, and anticipatory socialization for each phase takes place during the preceding period. When, however, the society itself is in a state of general transition rather than stability, the phasing of the family cycle may change, and discontinuities in socialization from phase to phase may occur. Thus, for example, rapid advances in medical and related areas of knowledge during the preceding half-century have been followed by sharp increases in life expectancy, resulting in an increased population of aged couples, many of whom remain healthy and active. This phenomenon, in effect a new stage of the family cycle, has received (and continues to receive) considerable attention from both medical and social science. Although certainly striking, this is not the only, and perhaps not the most radical, modification of the family cycle to occur during recent generations. This paper is concerned with an emergent phase of the family cycle referred to by Cavan as the postparental: postparental couple are the husband and wife, usually . . . in their forties and fifties. . ..

Additionally, the individuals interact with each other in a series of interactions that are interrelated and affect each other. Individuals form many different kinds of relationships with other people, some of which are intimate and close (e.g., parent–child, spouse–spouse, friendships) and others which are not intimate and close (e.g., neighbor, teacher–student). Most of the research on interpersonal relationships has focused on those relationships that are close, intimate, and have high interdependence. In an influential book, Kelley and colleagues (1983) define a close relationship as one that is strong, frequent, and with diverse interdependence that lasts over a considerable period of time. In sociology, although the classic distinction between primary and secondary relationships has been expanded in the public realm (fleeting, routinized, quasi‐primary, and intimate‐secondary relationships), these close relationships (as described above) also can be categorized as primary groups, which provide support and nurture and socialize individuals to the norms of society.",

      "title": "Marital transitions: A child's perspective.",
      "abstract": "Despite a recent leveling off of the divorce rate, almost half of the children born in the last decade will experience the divorce of their parents, and most of these children will also experience the remarriage of their parents. Most children initially experience their parents' marital rearrangements as stressful; however, children's responses to their parents marital transitions are diverse. Whereas some exhibit remarkable resiliency and in the long term may actually be enhanced by coping with these transitions, others suffer sustained developmental delays or disruptions. Others appear to adapt well in the early stages of family reorganizations but show delayed effects that emerge at a later time, especially in adolescence. The long-term effects are related more to the child's developmental status, sex, and temperament; the qualities of the home and parenting environments; and to the resources and support systems available to the parents and child than they are to divorce or remarriage per se. In recent years, researchers have begun to move away from the view that single-parent and remarried families are atypical or pathogenic families and are focusing on the diversity of children's responses and to the factors that facilitate or disrupt the development and adjustment of children experiencing their parents' marital transitions.",

It not only has to adjust to the sobriety of the recovering member (if this person is in recovery) but also has to make changes to function more effectively as a unit. Areas the family may need to address include accepting the SUD, stopping behaviors that reinforce substance use, improving communication, shifting family roles, reestablishing boundaries between generations, and building family togetherness. In some families, problems such as violence or abuse must be addressed. Professional treatment may be needed to address these issues and make changes in how the family functions. The change process can continue after treatment in mutual support programs.",

      "abstract": "Een toenemend aantal jongeren ondervindt als gevolg van ziekte of aandoening beperkingen in het maatschappelijk participeren. De meeste van hen ervaren mentale beperkingen, zoals verstandelijke beperkingen, psychische en/of ontwikkelingsstoornissen. Daarnaast hebben deze jongeren vaak meerdere aandoeningen, waarbij de interactie tussen deze aandoeningen de beperkingen vergroot en het werkvermogen negatief beinvloedt. Deze jongeren hebben veel minder kans om deel te nemen aan het arbeidsproces dan hun gezonde leeftijdsgenoten. Deze beperkte arbeidsdeelname wordt niet alleen veroorzaakt door de gevolgen van de ziekte of aandoening, maar wordt ook beinvloed door persoonlijke factoren (zoals leeftijd, geslacht, zelfbeeld, en motivatie) en omgevingsfactoren (zoals de sociale context). Verwachtingen over werk en motivatie zijn significante voorspellers voor werk. De sociale omgeving, zoals ouders en leerkrachten, speelt ook een belangrijke rol in het vinden van werk door deze jongeren. Als de jongeren eenmaal aan het werk zijn, nemen werkgevers en collega’s deze rol mogelijk over. Daarom is het van belang hen te stimuleren en te faciliteren om deze jongeren te ondersteunen om het werk te kunnen behouden. Het is van belang deze factoren mee te nemen bij de ontwikkeling van interventies om jongeren met een beperking te begeleiden om werk te vinden en te behouden. Tenslotte is het van belang dat werkgevers, gemeenten en nationale overheid geschikte banen voor jongeren met een beperking beschikbaar stellen. Beleid gericht op het opnemen van deze jongeren als volwaardige burgers in onze maatschappij is daarvoor noodzakelijk.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining disabled or dependent people at home is approached here through a \nsecondary analysis of the Handicap-Incapacites-Dependance survey conducted by \nINSEE in 1999 on people living in ordinary households. The authors seek to shed \nlight on the conditions of family care and professional care. For all people facing \nmajor daily difficulties, four types of practical arrangements emerge, according to \nthe type of incapacity and the configurations of the family structure: domestic \nindependence – a situation where the absence of declared carers can be interpreted \nas the result of an internal reorganisation of the household; adaptation – a situation \nwhere the longstanding nature of the incapacities makes it possible to do without \nhuman aid; dependency – a situation where the elderly people can only be \nmaintained at home with professional carers; and disability – a situation where \npeople who enjoy official recognition of their disability are cared for by their \nfamilies. While the latter two types of arrangement correspond roughly to the \ntargets of social policies on old age and disability, the first two refer to situations \nwhere individuals do not declare human care. Their interpretation suggests a need \nto rethink the concepts of need for aid and carers.",

In families where suicidal behaviour occurs there are three variables which distinguish them from families where no such behaviour occurs. These variables are; the threat of immediate break up of the family relationship i.e. someone is about to leave, a situation of mutual negative connotation where no matter what anyone tries to do it is seen as being ‘wrong’, a tradition of symptoms being used at times of crisis to keep the family together. Suicidal behaviour is seen as a strategic move to keep the family together in the face of developmental change.",

The infants initially showed threat responses and increased locomotion, characteristic of the protest stage of anaclitic depression in children. Within several days, these were replaced by dorso‐ventral contact among the infants as well as self‐holding and fetal positioning. Additionally, social and solitary play and object examination occurred at lower levels through separation than in the pre‐separation condition. These changes were characteristic of the despair stage of separation. There was a substantial recovery of many infant nonsocial and social behavior in the later months of the separation. Upon reunion, the infants did not immediately engage in attachment behaviors with their mothers, and spent more time in contact with each other than with their mothers for the first several days, indicating detachment. Following this, there was an increase in mother‐infant attachment behaviors.©1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

Materials and methods Analysis of data from the Intellectual Disability Supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS‐TILDA) ( n = 701) examined measures of interpersonal relationships and interactions. Predictors of family contact and having non‐resident friends were also explored. Results Social networks of older people with intellectual disability differ considerably from the general older population, with a reliance on support staff and co‐resident friends in place of their own immediate family structures and wider friendships. Proximity to family most strongly predicted family contact. Residence in independent or family residences was most strongly linked to having non‐resident friends. Conclusions While family proximity and community living are associated with improved social networks and contacts, older people with intellectual disability remain worse off than the general older population.",

For purposes of discussion the effects of the young are detailed in terms of two very different aspects of the parent—child interaction. One aspect concerns the provision of life support and protection. The behavior of the newborn further stimulates parental behavior. The thrashing and uncoordinated limb movements create an appearance of helplessness. The human infant's appearance alone could also have some effect on parental responsiveness in this early period, since the shape of the head (a short face relative to a large forehead and protruding cheeks) shows characteristics in line with several other species.",

      "abstract": "A missing person is defined as someone whose whereabouts are unknown and fears exist for the safety and welfare of that person. Families of a reported missing person experience many emotions including unresolved grief and ambiguous loss as they manage day to day with the traumatising reality of their loved one being psychologically present but physically absent. While not diminishing that recognised trauma, there are families with missing members who do not fit the usual social script of ‘missing persons’, and as a result, these families may gain different levels of public acknowledgement, support and empathy. An example is the trauma and loss felt by birth parents, tinged with a painful but enduring optimism of a reunion with their child, which might be better understood through a ‘missing person’ lens. Drawing on the personal narrative of the second author and past research of the first author, we seek to illuminate the ongoing trauma and ambiguous loss felt when a child is missing through adoption. We argue for a broader notion of ‘missing persons’ that could benefit families who remain excluded from social support and empathic understanding of their grief.",

      "abstract": "Chinese Canadian (CC) families are increasingly living in multi-generational households, often with grandparents who assist in child caregiving. CC families experience multiple changes both prior to and after resettlement in Canada that can shape their parenting styles and beliefs. Fifty-seven CC and European Canadian (EC) (n = 27) mother-child dyads participated in a play interaction, child cognitive assessment, parent interview, and parent questionnaires to examine parenting styles, child outcomes, maternal sensitivity, and parenting stress. Parenting in CC families, when framed within a bioecological model that accounts for the micro-systemic, cultural, and sociopolitical influences, was more similar to parenting in EC families and incorporated more permissive styles of parenting than previously believed. CC mothers attributed indulgent parenting styles in part to newer preferred parenting practices in China, as well as their desire to parent differently from their own upbringing. So-called Chinese parenting style was associated with negative child outcomes in EC and CC families. There were significant relationships between parenting stress and all reported parenting styles. CC mothers described the cultural continuities and discontinuities that contributed to the multi-generational family dynamics within their homes, including their desire to raise their Canadian-born children with Canadian parenting approaches. To support the continuity of Chinese cultural traditions and practices, many CC parents sought the involvement of co-residing grandparents in child rearing. Implications for clinical parenting interventions targeted to CC families, and immigration policies used by multi-generational immigrant families are discussed. Future research on the relationship between parenting stress and parenting styles, as well as the measurement of maternal sensitivity in CC families is recommended.",

Los C'hortis del oriente de Guatemala mantienen una particular forma de construir la desnutricion infantil, en ocasiones muy diferente al modelo biomedico en aspectos como la etiologia del trastorno o la responsabilidad del mismo. Desde una perspectiva netamente cualitativa, se realiza un repaso de las practicas y representaciones sobre su prevencion. La desnutricion infantil es, en este contexto, un trastorno social que se asocia de forma muy evidente a determinadas practicas maternas y un modelo social y moral determinado, y se desliga de la carencia de alimentos, de forma que la prevencion del trastorno pasa por modificar esos comportamientos maternos. Los intensos procesos de cambio social y la incipiente presencia del discurso alopatico han introducido modificaciones en esa forma particular de concebir el padecimiento. No obstante, estos cambios han implantado nuevas practicas sin apenas modificar las representaciones existentes, responsabilizando de nuevo a las madres, lo que pone de manifiesto las dificultades de un dialogo intercultural en salud entre cosmovisiones diferentes y las implicaciones de las intervenciones en salud en estos contextos, que deben prestar atencion a los diferentes significados del padecimiento.",

      "abstract": "Institutionalization is an exceptional and temporary measure that occurs when there is a violation of rights; lasting until the family reintegration or, in the impossibility of this, the placement in a substitute family through adoption. Among the main reasons for institutionalization in Brazil are the financial difficulties, abandonment, domestic violence, drug addiction, homelessness of the responsible for the child, sexual abuse, and the loss of parents by death or imprisonment. Although children and adolescents have their rights assured when they are institutionalized, the care provided in these spaces does not include all their needs and demands, which may damage their affective-relational development. Maternal deprivation in the first years of life can be detrimental to the development of these children, if not provided by adequate substitute care. Therefore, to understand which place the institutionalized baby occupies in the imaginary of the social caregivers and, from this, how is established the relationship regarding the care, is of fundamental importance to assess and address the risk factors in child development at this stage of life and in situation of institutionalization. This is an exploratory and descriptive study, developed in a childcare institution, located in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, capable of accommodating up to 20 babies between 0 and 2 years old. Data collection was performed with nine employees, eight social caregivers and one general service assistant who work directly in the care of the institutionalized babies. Drawing-Story with Theme (DS-T) procedures were used. Qualitative analysis was based on Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The appreciation of the nine applied Drawing-Story procedures allowed the establishment of three discussion axes representations of baby, baby care, and early separation process. This study concluded that the difficulties that permeate the context of caregivers' work are the high turnover of institutionalized children, as well as employees, the difficulty of dealing with processes of bonding and breaking bonds and no recognition of the profession. We highlight that the place that these babies occupy in the imaginary of these caregivers influences the bond they establish with the children hence the care offered to the babies. It is also noteworthy that these caregivers exhibited anguish and suffering from the reasons they believed led the children to be institutionalized.",

      "title": "Effect of Family Functioning on Adolescents' Alienation:Moderated Mediating Effect",
      "abstract": "Alienation is a negative emotional state,reflecting individual impotence in dealing with others and establishing an effective bond with social groups,such as among family,classmates and peers. While modest alienation is good for psycho-social development,high levels of alienation may negatively impact development. Adolescence is a period of heightened risk for high levels of alienation. Research on the relationship between the family environment and peer relations revealed that higher conflicts among numbers of family as well as weak or unhealthy family functioning could lead to adolescents feeling alienated from their parents and resisting inclusion in their family. Those who scored high on the alienation scale usually lived in a troubled family,where family members experienced a lack of close relationships and self-control,and were unable to adapt to social experiences properly. However,peer groups are another necessary micro-system that play an important role in adolescents psychological social development. Good peer relations can provide adolescents with valuable information and feelings of support; and positive peer acceptance can help alienated adolescents alleviate the sense of stress and anxiety. But neither family environment nor peer acceptance can affect adolescents' alienation on its own. Research is needed to examine the interaction between the effects of the family environment and peer acceptance. The majority of research on adolescent alienation has been conducted in Western cultures,and information on how contemporary Chinese adolescents experience alienation is still limited. In the past two decades,China has experienced profound transformations; rapid social and economic development has changed the family structure through socioeconomic status and general family functioning. It is thus necessary to explore the alienation characteristics of Chinese adolescents from a systemic perspective,and to find the interaction mechanisms of family functioning and peer acceptance. The present study investigated the effect of family socioeconomic status,family functioning,and peer acceptance on adolescents' feelings of alienation in contemporary China. The Adolescent Alienation Scale,Family Function Scale,Family SES measure and Peer Nomination survey were administered to 608 adolescents (317 boys and 291 girls) attending junior and senior high school in Jinan City,Shandong Province,using Structural Equation Model Analysis. Results were as follows:(1) There was a significant difference between school-age stages; senior high school students reported higher alienation than students from junior high school. (2) A significant difference was found among three dimensions of adolescents' alienation; environmental alienation was highest,followed by social alienation,and interpersonal alienation being the lowest. (3) Family functioning could fully mediate the relationship between family socioeconomic status and adolescent alienation. That is,parents' education level,their professions,and the family's income could affect adolescents' alienation through influencing family functioning. However,the mediating effect of family functioning was moderated by peer acceptance. High peer acceptance could actually protect adolescents who were in a family with poor functioning from high alienation. In fact,family functioning,as a moderated mediator,had an effect on adolescents' alienation. These results imply that we could assist adolescents with high alienation by improving their family socioeconomic status,improving their family functioning,and helping them build positive peer relations.",

      "title": "Resolutions: Working with Families Where Responsibility for Abuse is Denied",
      "abstract": "Current thinking suggests that little productive work can be undertaken with families where serious physical or sexual abuse of children has occurred in the absence of a clear acceptance of responsibility for that abuse. This means that children are often removed from their families because of the perceived risks, with the disadvantages that being looked after in local authority care often brings. Alternatively, children may be left in the same environment where serious abuse has taken place with little or no work being undertaken with the family. Either approach fails children, especially those who have made clear and believable allegations in the hope of bringing about a process of change and protection. This article describes the work of a pilot project at the Avon NSPCC in Bristol working with families where the alleged abuser disputes responsibility for maltreating the child. Key to this approach is the support of the non-abusing carer and the child/ren while the concerns of the professional agencies are addressed. The work has two main phases. The first looks for structural change in the organization of family life. The second part asks carers to role-play a 'similar' hypothetical family where child abuse has been established. This enables difficult issues raised by the abuse to be addressed and provides an opportunity for carers to express thoughts and feelings to their partner regarding abuse without the seriousness of the concerns being lost.",

The study was conducted with 28 children aging 0-3 years old from 20 households in the rural area of Cocal, Piaui. This dry area is located at the northeast part of Brazil, 4-1 one of the poorest of the country. Ethnographic methods, naturalistic observations and semistructured interviews were used in order describe the physical context (the house and its surroundings), the feeding, sleeping and toilet routines and some of the parents' representations about them. The main results were: l.The breastfeeding routine was strongly associated the mothers' working schedule as coconut breakers, varying between anticipated, ad lib and time-scheduled feeding, the combination of two of these schedules often resulted in delayed weaning; 2.Parents argued that sleeping next the baby in the hammock was the most adequate practice for night care and strenghten parent-child bonds; 3.Toilet training was facilitated by imitation and by the physical conditions (warm climate and soil floors); 4.Caretaking was provide by a network of mothers, grandmothers and older children; 5.Although the children was precociously independent, autonomy was not valued as children under five are thought to lack understanding. Results suggest that: 1.This is an eco-system which still operates in an integrated manner, but already shows signs of acculturation; 2.The lack of social support during the severe draughts is contributing family desintegration; 3.The child is not expected develop autonomy and be capable of self-determined transformation actions, this reproducting the parents' life conditions. Key-words. Child development; context; dwelling ; sleeping; feeding; toilet training; household; brazilian rural It is possible think of development as life itself (Oyama,1989). Every kind of development occurs in a context that, at the same time, gives meaning it through systems of beliefs, and contains it, through the interactions it (the context) provides. Development and context form an integrated whole from which the concrete manifestation results: the developing child. Whiting (1980) has shown that the main regulators of the child's social context are the ecological variables of subsistence, which determine not only the size and composition of the group, but also its daily activities. According Dasen (1991), individual behaviour is determined, at least partially, by culture, which is the group's reaction of conformity the ecological, social, economic and historical conditions. The links between the group's characteristics and the individuals' behaviour imply processes of genetic transmission, cultural transmission, ecological influences and enculturation. The model of developmental niche (Harkness, 1992) is a theoretical framework the psychology of development, compatible with the above mentioned ecocultural model.

      "abstract": "Children encounter moral norms in several different social contexts. Often it is in hierarchically structured interactions with parents or other adults, but sometimes it is in more symmetrically structured interactions with peers. Our question was whether children's discussions of moral norms differ in these two contexts. Consequently, we had 4- and 6-year-old children (N = 72) reason about moral dilemmas with their mothers or peers. Both age groups opposed their partner's views and explicitly justified their own views more often with peers than with mothers. Mothers adapted their discussions to the cognitive levels of their children (e.g., focused more on the abstract moral norms with 6-year-old children than with 4-year-old children), but almost always with a pedagogical intent. Our results suggest that with mothers, moral judgments are experienced mostly as non-negotiable dictums, but with coequal peers they are experienced more as personal beliefs that can be actively negotiated.

Unaccompanied adolescents have lost their family's emotional and social support, which may negatively affect their individuation and identity development. Other challenges include encountering new acculturation forces, as well as discrimination and material hardship. Separation–individuation, which is characterized by increased self‐awareness, agency, and self‐evaluation capacities, may also be affected by the new contingencies (e.g., acculturation, discrimination). The new contingencies can enhance or suppress the process of personal, role, and social identity development with potentially different or similar trajectories for each gender. Various personal and social identities interact and intersect to produce different outcomes. The identity trauma paradigm is employed to discuss the development of each of these identities in the context of acculturation and discrimination challenges for refugee adolescents.",

      "title": "Behavioral and biological regulators of hypervigilance following early life adversity",
      "abstract": "The early life environment sets the foundation for socioemotional development throughout life. Of particular importance is the relationship between caregivers and their offspring, in which predictable, consistent care supports normative neurobehavioral development and environmental insults can have long-term consequences. Childhood adversity often disrupts typical parent-child interactions and increases the risk for later-emerging psychiatric disorders. Early life adversity also impacts pubertal development, with girls being more likely to undergo early pubertal maturation if they experienced childhood adversity. This accelerated maturation is associated with an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression later in life. Modeling early life adversity in rodents necessitates a disruption of naturalistic mother-infant interactions. Several models of early life adversity have been developed in rats, including maternal separation (MS) and limited bedding and nesting (LBN). Both MS and LBN result in aberrant offspring outcomes, which may differ depending on the offspring's age, sex, variability in maternal care they received, and pubertal timing. Despite the apparent link between childhood experiences and later-life psychopathologies, few have investigated specific characteristics that mediate outcomes across rearing experiences, and none have identified a biological mechanism underlying adversity-induced pubertal acceleration. Chapter 2 characterizes the mother-infant relationship in MS and LBN by observing maternal behavior and the offspring's response to acute isolation. In rats, licking, grooming, and nursing are vital for pup survival and development. Patterns of maternal care have recently been emphasized as a key factor of the rearing environment, with more predictive care being associated with positive developmental outcomes. Chapter 2 demonstrates that dams in the MS paradigm engage in compensatory licking and grooming upon reunion with pups. These dams also display less predictable caregiving patterns, a feature previously expected only in LBN. Chapter 2 also investigated the development of pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), emitted as a means to elicit maternal care. Results show that MS and LBN both accelerated the expected developmental trajectories of USV emissions. Different acoustic properties of USVs, such as principle frequency, bandwidth, and sonographic structures, were also impacted depending on the type of adversity experienced. These alterations in USV properties may impact their functionality in guiding maternal care. Chapter 3 explores the impacts of MS on threat responsivity and its relationship to pubertal timing. The acoustic startle reflex (ASR) is an evolutionarily conserved defensive response and measure of vigilance, modulated by experience and context. Results show that MS increased ASR magnitude in adolescent females, and this was exacerbated by earlier pubertal initiation. Chapter 3 also presents a novel ASR modification, in which a social threat (22kHz aversive USVs) is presented before the ASR test. Standard-reared rats had an enhanced ASR when exposed to potential threat compared to baseline, while MS rats did not distinguish between testing contexts. These results indicate that MS rats fail to exhibit the expected response to a threatening stimulus. Chapter 3 also sought to determine whether MS changes the expression of hypothalamic genes underlying pubertal initiation. MS increased mRNA expression of kisspeptin and gonadotropin-releasing hormone in prepubertal females. To determine whether this gene upregulation was dependent on stress signaling, the cellular colocalization of kisspeptin with corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRH-R1) was quantified. Results from this experiment provide evidence that MS decreases CRH-R1-dependent signaling in Kisspeptin neurons, preventing CRH from suppressing puberty. Together, these studies describe the qualities of the early life environment that contribute to adversity-induced dysfunction across rearing conditions. The data support the importance of individual variability in mediating outcomes throughout life, as well as distinct biological processes responding to adversity in male and female offspring. These findings have important implications for developing interventions in vulnerable populations. --Author's abstract",

      "abstract": "Abstract “Not to be a burden” is a common phrase used by community-dwelling older adults in discussing their dependency on others in care for their daily life. This attitude may lead to conflicts with relatives, neighbors, or professionals when in their opinion, care is necessary and, ultimately, may result in unmet care needs. The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of how older adults experience their increased dependency on others and to contribute to the development of an ethic of care. Thirty-two participants of a larger research sample (n=64) from a descriptive qualitative research were purposefully selected, resulting in an equal distribution of the following variables: gender, living situation, living with or without partner, and having children or not. From a multiphase qualitative analysis with five researchers, including two senior citizens four themes emerged: (1) relationships in the context of care; (2) experiences with giving, receiving and asking for care; (3) future perspectives towards receiving and asking for care; and (4) actual practices of caregiving and receiving. Our study clarifies how community-dwelling older adults deal with the changes in their dependency on others. The study results highlight particular dynamics which appear, at least, partly in contrast with current policy regarding care at home. Moreover, it contributes to an empirical refinement of the concepts of dependency and interdependency in an ethic of care. Further studies are needed to clarify the influential factors on asking for care in diverse groups of older adults and the response from their network.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral biologists and comparative psychologists have long been interested in species that display a social system labeled “cooperative breeding”, in which members of the social group assist in rearing young that are not their own offspring. The definitional hallmarks of cooperative breeding concentrate on the distinctive attributes of these care-giving individuals, and they include (1) delayed dispersal from the natal group, (2) reproductive suppression, and (3) care for others' offspring. The individuals engaging in care of young may be nonbreeding adults or subadults (usually called helpers, auxiliaries, or alloparents), or they may be reproductive adults sharing in the care of young with other breeders in the social group. In the former, all three of the previously mentioned characteristics are seen, whereas in the latter, typically only the third characteristic is required for groups to be considered cooperative breeders. The types of care given to young by alloparents is remarkably diverse and includes patterns classified as both depreciable parental care (defined by Clutton-Brock 1991 as those patterns that change as a function of the number of offspring that are cared for; e.g., provisioning with food) and nondepreciable ones (those patterns that do not vary with the number of offspring that are cared for; e.g., burrow defense).",

      "title": "Caring as predominantly ‘silent’, sociomaterial acts of mutual well-becoming : symposium contribution",
      "abstract": "Human beings express their care for one another via a wide variety of communicative or expressive acts, of which only a miniscule part are verbal. And yet, it is via words and concepts that human beings primarily come to negotiate and agree on fellow notions of well-being, including agreements of what good care in childrearing institutions entails. This verbal/non-verbal discrepancy becomes particularly evident when investigating children’s contributions to promoting one another’s as well as one’s own well-being, as a current participatory practice study situated at the Danish Center for Early Childhood and Care Research underlines: While acts of promoting well-being through caring pervade daycare institutions, the language available for negotiating and agreeing on which direction our mutual caregiving is to take tends to either draw on technocratic indicator models alienated from everyday practice, or on everyday concepts that can describe some of the more immediate emotional experiencing but have a difficult time projecting current practice into the future. Both possibilities render it difficult to ground negotiations and agreements on the directionality of mutual caregiving processes in the everyday life conducted across children and adults at a daycare. In order to sustainably tackle this discrepancy in the attempt of communicating and acting on well-being together across generational orderings, the contribution at hand exemplifies empirical and conceptual possibilities for communicatively exploring acts of well-becoming. These acts are not only immanently social, as they are always already grounded in everyday life conducted together with others. It is also immanently material, and it is precisely this latter theoretical clarification that is necessary for expanding the scope of communicative acts towards mutual well-becoming to include non-verbal expressions. The aim of the presentation is finally to argue for a processual-relational methodology that focuses on exploring the material dimension of well-being from within practice. It suggests ‘sociomaterial conduct of everyday life’, ‘acts of mutual well-becoming’ as well as ‘transgenerational teleogenetic collaboration’ as fundamental concepts in order to ground understandings and negotiations of practicing well-being through caring in fellow everyday life, including that of the researcher.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile delinquency is one of the most difficult problems of modern society. These persons, being socially active, perceive both positive and negative features of not only peers, but also older persons. Cases when from an early age a person is in a dysfunctional family environment, because the socio-negative factors affecting him are magnified. Every crime committed by a person under the age of 18 has many causes from a criminological point of view. However, a key role is given to the family, since the negative impact on the character and behavior is carried out from the earliest childhood. Among the negative factors that directly affect the commission of a crime by a minor, we can primarily include the general family atmosphere, if it has a destructive effect on the psyche of the child. This is manifested in the illegal behavior of adults, lack of spiritual family values, unhealthy psychological climate in the family. Family problems create a number of conditions that contribute to the formation of the personality of the juvenile offender. These include: living of a minor in unsanitary conditions; lack of sufficient living space for education and life; insufficient family income, which negatively affects the place of a minor in the society of peers; examples of negative behavior of adult family members (offenses, alcoholism, drug addiction); incorrect relationship between parents and child; the use of violence against minors as an educational measure. Therefore, timely and accurate diagnosis of micro-social causes that form the personality of a juvenile offender and the development of comprehensive preventive measures are required.",

      "title": "“Can’t imagine having one without the other now”: Maternal perceptions of pets and attachment relationships in the perinatal period",
      "abstract": "Abstract Maternal mental wellbeing and secure attachment relationships are critical for an infant’s socioemotional and psychological development, with research focusing on environmental influences on these elements. Simultaneously, studies are probing how pets provide a bidirectional bond for owners across the lifespan. This article broadens the intersection of these fields by exploring how mothers perceive their own and their infants’ perinatal relationship with their pet. Applying thematic analysis to online survey responses, three themes were developed: (1) Manifestation &amp; perception of changing attachments, (2) Caregiver prioritization, and (3) Patterns of potential baby-pet attachment. Findings indicate that the mother-pet relationship was unique to each individual, with some mothers reporting changing perinatal pet behaviors (e.g., increased closeness) that they interpreted as indicative of an attachment bond, and others (e.g., avoidance) being interpreted as making a bond less secure after birth. Mothers also reported that feelings of attachment were dependent on the extent to which they prioritized a pet. Finally, some mothers felt that observed interactions indicated an attachment-like bond between baby and pet. Additional research is needed to understand these relationships and changes, their implications for infant development, and how they may be used as a protective perinatal factor.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\n Parents of a child with a disability have an expanded and exaggerated role. Both mother and father are expected to fulfill societal requirements in being parents, as well as being expected to meet the specific needs arising due to the disability. This child demands more time and attention. Acceptance of the child is difficult, being hindered by accompanying feelings of guilt, anger, depression, self-blame and/or blaming the spouse (Copel, 1973). Society expects the parents to cope with having a disabled child, holds the parents responsible for socializing a disabled child to be like other children and yet expects the child to know his place among the normal, the stigmatized (Goffman, 1963).\n The mother is the primary socializing agent of the child. She must help the child learn to conform in his social behavior and to learn the skills of daily living even when the child is handicapped. Yet she is not provided with supports when her child is not capable of achieving the same as the non-handicapped child.\n This study was designed to gain understanding into the mother's perception of her experience vis-a-vis her child, given that her perception determines her emotional state, her attitude toward her child, herself, and her family, and dictates her current intervention with this child.",

      "title": "Espacios amigos de la lactancia humana en entornos laborales.",
      "abstract": "Human breastfeeding is recognised worldwide as the ideal food for infant growth and development, and is also part of the reproductive process with important repercussions for mothers (1). Furthermore, the practice of breastfeeding promotes accessibility and sustainability and invites us to think about a model of food production that is sustainable for our territories and healthy both for those who choose to breastfeed and for children (2). The growing feminisation of the labour market and in fields of study, as well as the different family configurations, together with changes in the organisation of work and production, have increased tensions between work and family dynamics and demands. Thus, the greatest challenge arises from the attempt to reconcile family and personal life with work/professional life, guaranteeing the necessary co-responsibility between families, the State, the market and society in general, in order to advance towards gender equity and equal opportunities in terms of health (3). Different situations represent barriers to continued breastfeeding. These include insufficient acceptance of the practice in society, lack of time available to mothers, limited support at home, work and school, feelings of modesty or embarrassment about breastfeeding in public, and a certain cultural preference for breastfeeding (4). For both working women and students, returning to work or study after maternity leave represents one of the main obstacles to sustaining breastfeeding, often due to negative attitudes within institutional settings, long hours away from home, short break times, lack of childcare facilities and insufficient and inadequate spaces for breastfeeding or safe milk expression within work institutions (5). It is clear then that combining breastfeeding and work requires a support network within the workplace that transcends the will of mothers and families. International organisations specialising in health issues and women's and children's rights, including the World Health Organisation (WHO), the United Nations (UN) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) through their declarations such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, have emphasised the importance of breastfeeding in their declarations, have highlighted the importance of breastfeeding for women and the great benefits for the mother-child pair, families, society as a whole and for the ecosystem as it is a practice that does not degrade natural resources and also contributes to protecting the environment (6-8). For its part, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) points out the importance of the right to breastfeed, establishing the duty of employers to provide the necessary breaks in the working day or limits on the length of the working day to encourage women who return to work after maternity leave to continue breastfeeding. The ILO has also recommended that adequate breastfeeding facilities be established in or near the workplace and notes that employers who allow mothers the time to breastfeed, and/or provide a space for breastfeeding with adequate hygienic conditions, benefit in terms of increased productivity due to reduced absenteeism for parental care leave (due to better health status of babies), a higher rate of return to work after maternity leave and a better sense of well-being of women workers. However, women-mothers' workplaces generally lack such spaces, which with minimal structural and equipment requirements could function to facilitate the return to work and the continuation of breastfeeding (9,10). A room for expressing and conserving human milk, known in our environment as a ‘breastfeeding friendly space’, is a small, quiet, private and peaceful place that, being installed within an institution where women of reproductive age work, allows those who are breastfeeding to express their milk and store it refrigerated in adequate temperature and hygiene conditions until they return home. Within the family, the possibility of reserving and transporting expressed milk during the working day allows, in the absence of the mother, the partner and/or caregiver to feed the child, taking an active role in the shared responsibility of breastfeeding (10,11). Setting up one of these rooms is not a costly investment, it requires minimal facilities and equipment and the will of the management to make it happen. It also requires logistics of care and operation that include the essential commitment of the institutional authority, the workers, the family and society as a whole. For this to happen, there must be a collective awareness from which each person can contribute their skills, knowledge and sensitivity to the operation and maintenance of the room (11,12). The Breastfeeding Friendly Spaces at Work initiative contributes to guaranteeing the right of women working outside the home to breastfeed and to make informed decisions free from commercial pressures. At the same time, it guarantees the right of children to a healthy diet such as their mother's own milk, thus constituting one of the legal tools that contributes most equally to the continuity of breastfeeding regardless of the form of employment of women working outside the home, as well as providing women of reproductive age who are studying with support to help them through this stage of their lives. Encouraging the transformation of workplaces and women's development into breastfeeding-friendly environments offers the possibility of sharing the responsibilities inherent in this practice, contributing collectively to health promotion and social justice from the beginning of life.",

The aims are (a) to verify whether cohabiting fathers are more or less involved in childcare than married ones are and (b) to examine the mechanisms behind the possible differences. The focus is on both the daily basic childcare as a whole and on the specific activities of daily basic care (such as putting the child to sleep, dressing the child and changing its nappies). In addition, also potential differences among married fathers are examined, distinguishing between those who marry directly and those with pre-marital cohabitation. Results show that a higher involvement in the daily basic childcare of cohabiting fathers and of married fathers with pre-marital cohabitation may be completely explained by the fact that these typologies of couples are selected by structural differences which are positively associated with the higher fathers' basic childcare.",

Critical theory for understanding the role of adolescent siblings in the family and in each other's lives is discussed from the perspective of relationships, family systems, social learning, psychodynamic, and behavioral–genetic theories. These theories provide a framework for the discussion of characteristics of the sibling relationship, which includes a focus on structural features, cultural differences, and relationship quality as key factors. Associations between sibling relationship quality and developmental outcomes include both positive and negative outcomes. Positive outcomes focus on prosocial behaviors such as kindness, sympathy, and emotional self‐regulation, whereas negative outcomes include aggression, bullying, and engaging in at‐risk behaviors such as delinquency and substance abuse. In addition, the association between relationship quality and psychopathology is covered, and also interventions for dealing with problematic sibling relationships. Finally, the effects of parents on sibling relations and different types of sibling relationships (i.e., children with a sibling with special needs, step‐ and half‐siblings, singletons) are also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The article was based on interviews with children and their families on various topics related to vacation-time foodways, in particular related to the phenomenon of preparing, selecting and receiving food. I refer to the children’s voice on this issue, which is still little known. My aim is to describe the nature of this participation and children’s attitudes, presented on the basis of the utterances of children and their parents from the urban (capital) upper middle class. The narratives I described allowed me to understand that while traveling and on vacations children co-create the social world together with adults in a very clear and extremely engaged way, having greater freedom of action and agency and a greater influence on the choices they make. This happens in various ways: children often willingly repeat and imitate the culinary behavior of adults, others constantly negotiate with their parents about the dishes and snacks they really want to eat or which they definitely do not want to eat on holiday. At the same time, they can question adults’ decisions and attitudes, categorically refusing to eat some type of food. Children also process in their own individual way what their parents say, e.g. about unhealthy cuisine. Children want to make their own food choices, knowing the limits and accepting them. They are open to new things, but only in a safe environment and with the full involvement of parents in these initial participations. They are more open and willing to this than parents initially think.",

      "abstract": "One area with strong potential to prevent or treat early childhood obesity is feeding dynamics.1 The concept of feeding dynamics includes 2 central components: caregiver feeding role (how, when, where, and what caregivers feed their children) and child eating behaviors (how much, when, what, and whether to eat of what is offered).\r\n\r\nThe feeding dynamic approach was initially proposed as the trust model by Ellyn Satter.2,3 In this approach, caregivers are responsible for offering nutritious foods and exposing children to new foods, providing structured snack and mealtimes to decrease indiscriminate eating, identifying a designated area for eating or drinking within the home, sitting and eating with children, and keeping the eating atmosphere pleasant. Children are responsible for what to eat and how much (or even whether) to eat from the food provided. Unlike conventional interventions for obesity, the feeding dynamic emphasizes how to feed,4 placing less weight on conventional intervention areas such as portion sizes and low-fat or low-calorie food options as well as discourages excessively restrictive feeding practices. A growing body of literature reveals a complex relationship between controlling feeding behaviors and the child's weight.5-9 In particular, overly restrictive behaviors significantly reduce a child's ability to self-regulate their energy intake5,10-12 and result in weight gain or a higher body mass index (BMI).5,6\r\n\r\nIn order to examine the potential of a feeding dynamic approach to reduce childhood obesity in young children, it would be useful to know the extent caregivers already perform these roles as well as the relationships between these roles, other maternal feeding and eating practices, concerns about the child being or becoming overweight, and demographic variables. Therefore, the objective of this brief report is to provide this information and a foundation on which a feeding dynamic intervention can be developed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Changing demographics and a host of social trends have created variations in dementia family care, including older adults’ reliance on extended kin. To advance understanding of the heterogeneity of dementia family care structures, we focused on nieces and nephews who serve as primary caregivers for their aunts and uncles living with dementia. Guided by a life course perspective and grounded in a stress-coping framework, we used a mixed-method study design to explore how past and present family relationships and dynamics shape caregiving responsibilities, practices, and outcomes. Mixed-method interviews with 20 niece and 5 nephew dementia caregivers (Mage = 55 yrs; R = 38-67) revealed diverse pathways to care provision. Close relationships were established in childhood for 21 respondents, even among those who lived at a distance from their aunt/uncle. Two-thirds of the nieces/nephews never expected to be their relative’s caregiver, but rather either gradually “fell into it” or abruptly assumed the role because of “family circumstances.” Rarely were nieces/nephews the sole caregiver; some coordinated care with their aunts’/uncles’ family members, their own family members, and formal service providers whereas others looked to another family member only for occasional assistance. Nieces/nephews who relied on family support to care for their relative living with dementia experienced more caregiver burden (rs = 0.49, p&amp;lt;0.03) and faced greater family strain (rs = 0.61, p&amp;lt;0.01). Notably, niece caregivers reported more difficulties with other family members than nephews (rpb =0.50, p&amp;lt;0.02). Discussion elaborates on the complexity of extended family relationships and realities of dementia care today.",

Primary caregiving fathers can competently assume caregiving and nurturant functions so as to become their infants' primary attachment figures.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Based on videotaped home observations, Dr. Geiger examines the unique and interactive effects of the gender of the caregiver and the primacy of the caregiver role on parent-infant interaction. Dr. Geiger observed 56 parents of different gender (father-mother) and caregiving role (primary-secondary) interacting with their infant in a non-stressful situation. Then infants were placed under stress in a modified version of the Strange Situation. A gender X caregiving role analysis of variance indicated no gender or role effect for parents' and infants' affiliative behaviors under nonstressful conditions except for fathers' rough tumble play. A caregiving role and/or a gender X role interaction effect was observed on the attachment behaviors of parents (caregiving and displaying affection) and of infants (displaying affection, clinging, moving away, and exploring). Infants' play interaction was most synchronous with that of primary caregiving fathers. Finally, the caregiver role effect indicated on all infants' attachment behaviors under stress showed a distinctive preference for primary caregivers (fathers or mothers) with disregard for gender.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Dr. Geiger's study indicates that primary caregiving fathers can be as competent as primary and secondary caregiving mothers. They were more affectionate, and despite an increased amount of assumed caregiving and household chores, primary caregiving fathers were more involved and in greater synchrony with their infant's play activities than primary or secondary caregiving mothers. This study challenges sex-role stereotypes and suggests benefits of modeling a more egalitarian upbringing. It presents strategies to resolve the dilemma of day care for infants. This book will be of great interest to students, scholars, and other researchers involved with early childhood education, socioemotional development of children, and developmental psychology, especially once it is acknowledged that father care in the home for infants less than one year of age has become the most common form of primary nonmaternal care arrangement (21.6%) adopted by employed mothers.</JATS1:p>",

In this cross-sectional survey consenting parents were identified by the Children's Treatment Network. Families were eligible if the child from 0 to 19 years, resided in Simcoe/York, and there were multiple family needs. Regression analysis was used to explore associations and interactions. n = 429. Results. Younger children, without conduct disorder, without hostile and punitive parenting and with low adverse family impact demonstrated the highest levels of psychosocial quality of life. Statistically significant interactions between processes of care and parent variables highlight the complexity of real life situations. Conclusions. It is not possible to fully understand the child's psychosocial quality of life in complex needs families by considering only simple associations between ecological factors. A multitude of factors and interactions between these factors are simultaneously present and the care of these families requires a holistic approach.",

Four family types were identified with cluster analysis: (a) conflict-control, (b) structured, cohesive, expressive, and recreation-oriented, (c) structured, cohesive, and low conflict, and (d) unstructured and low control. Families with high cohesion, expressiveness, organization, low conflict, and low to medium level of control were associated with a more constructive coping style. Chinese adolescents tended to (a) mobilize personal resources, (b) seek help from social resources, and (c) adopt a philosophy of doing nothing as their major coping style when they had a positive perception of their family environment. This coping style was termed \"fatalistic voluntarism.\" Finally, boys' coping behaviors were somewhat different from girls'. Girls tended to rely more on social support, whereas boys tended to avoid the problem or engage in blaming.",

Ces deux types d'atteintes sur soi diffèrent à la fois par les caractéristiques sociales et pénales des détenus concernés et leurs motivations:la grève de la faim est le fait de détenus plus âgés que la moyenne, relativement bien intégrés sur les plans familial et professionnel mais inculpés pour des infractions souvent graves et dont les motifs de revendication sont en lien direct avec la situation pénale (motifs judiciaires). Inversement, les automutilations qui semblent constituer davantage des passages à l'acte ou des conduites irréfléchies sont souvent perpétrées par des détenus eux-mêmes instables, sans responsabilités familiales et de niveau social inférieur à celui de la moyenne des détenus. Ils sont généralement inculpés pour des infractions ne donnant pas lieu à de lourdes peines et leur motif de contestation porte davantage sur des questions familiales ou personnelles, ou concerne les conditions de détention plutôt que le principe même de l'incarcération. Enfin, ces conduites sont plus fréquentes pendant les moments creux de la vie institutionnelle (soirée, week-end, jours fériés).",

The hermeneutic-dialectic, theoretical, methodological framework was employed. The following categories emerged from the analysis: 1. Movements inhibiting emotions and feelings; 2. Presence of processes of symbiosis and emotional dependence in the older adult-relative relationship; 3. Contentment in caring for the dependent older adult; and 4. Giving up current and future life projects. The results reveal life experiences marked by symbiotic processes, emotional dependence, and psychic stress. Dependence causes suffering and feelings of despair, powerlessness, impatience, but also solidarity and empathy. Withdrawal from the job market, social depreciation of family caregiver's activity, social isolation, neglected self-care, and family conflicts impact caregivers' subjectivity. The elaboration of public policies must consider the social-affective life experiences of family caregivers of dependent older adults in order to include the care of those providing care.",

How do they handle the problems, and how important is the relation between the social worker and the child's parents? The research project includes 189 child welfare cases with 0–3-year-old children in ten local communities in Sweden. The article shows that the social work can be categorized into four different types of work, where the work done, as well as the relation between the social worker and the child's parents, differ. (1) The social worker is mediating help and support and has a positive contact with the child's parents. (2) The social worker is exercising control and authority and has a negative contact with the child's parents. (3) The social worker is doing treatment-oriented work and has a personal involvement and a relation to the parents that is important for the family and not exchangeable. (4) The social worker is solely engaged in investigatory work with no relation to the child's parents, rather a neutral contact. In the categorization the concepts contact and relation are differentiated. Only in the treatment-oriented category, encompassing about one-fifth of the children, can one speak of a relation. In all categories there are elements of both help and control, but different ways of handling this doubleness.",

      "abstract": "The widening gap between the well-being of old and young people; the worrying increase in public transfers towards elderly people; the change in family relations and behaviours (such as the lengthened coresidence with young adult children): these current difficulties motivate a reassessment of the concept of between generations. Within a given group (being a family, a club, a class, a nation...), solidarity relies on a collective quasi-contract, which links its members with obligations of reciprocal exchange making everybody better off over the long run. From an economic point of view, its main role would be to remedy to various shortcomings of the market: first, it provides an enlarged insurance, covering everybody prior to birth, and also against unpredictable events (reduction of uncertainty); and second, it allows rules of indirect (ascending or descending) reciprocity between three succeeding generations or more. Solidarity suffers, however, from several drawbacks: moral hazard, arbitrary and costly control, horizontal inequity, instability of the contract in the course of time... This discussion enlights the current debate concerning the role of the welfare state. According to some (liberal) economists, this role has become harmful: public policy now creates uncertainty; and in the conflict between generations the state takes sides with the old ones. For others however, including Gary Becker, state intervention is part of a profitable and equitable social compact, the public support of the elderly allowing poor or middle class families to achieve efficient levels of human capital investments in their children.",

Additionally, they are at risk for many unique problems due to their dependency on and vulnerability to harm by adults. Their problems may be related to an absence of adequate family support and appropriate adult models, exposure to unhealthy social systems and traumatic situations, attachment issues, and difficulties with emotional regulation. Peer conflicts can also create distress for youth. Further, while children and adolescents are dependent on adults to get most of their needs met, they are often distrusting of adults, including social workers. The purpose of this chapter is to consider how social workers can engage with members of this population and develop relationships with them based on trust.",

Mejor dicho, en el relato de los medios de comunicacion –en especial, la television– la educacion primaria de adultos se encuentra representada en el genero retrato, pero el personaje es el adulto mayor, generalmente padre/ madre de familia o abuelo/a, quien relata las causas de su abandono de la escuela (problemas familiares o necesidad de trabajar) y la posterior alegria, al poder volver a las aulas para terminar de aprender.

While children from low risk families appear to gain no cognitive advantage from day care, those from high risk families or with developmental problems do. Problems with hearing, vision, development or behavior, and child abuse may be identified in a well organized centre.

Because remarriages end in divorce more often than first marriages, many children experience the dissolution of stepgrandparent ties. Little is known about stepgrandparent relationships in general and even less is known about how these relationships are affected by divorce. Guided by symbolic interaction theory, the purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore what happens to stepgrandparent/stepgrandchild relationships after remarriage dissolution. Twenty-nine former stepgrandchildren (aged 18–37) were interviewed about their relationships with former stepgrandparents. Contact frequency and quality of post-dissolution relationships were contingent on efforts by middle-generation parents or stepparents to encourage or impede former stepgrandparents’ endeavors to remain involved with stepgrandchildren. Losing connections with former stepgrandparents was upsetting to former stepgrandchildren, especially when their relationships with biological grandparents were not close. Individuals who maintained relationships with former stepgrandparents perceived positive benefits for themselves.",

Accurate estimates for the numbers of children affected globally are impossible to obtain, but around 120 million children alone are thought to be in some form of employment, with the highest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper [1] is a defence of a modified version of Jane English's model of filial obligations based on adult children's friendship with their parents. (I) Unlike the more traditional view that filial obligations are a repayment for parental sacrifices, the friendship model puts filial duties in the appealing context of voluntary, loving relationships. (II) Contrary to English's original statement of this view, which is open to the charge of tolerating filial ingratitude, the friendship model can generate obligations to help our parents even if we are no longer friendly with them. (III) Joseph Kupfer has pointed out several ways in which parent‐child relationships differ from peer friendships; but his arguments do not preclude our enjoying a type of friendship with our parents. (IV) In response to Christina Hoff Sommers, who objects that feelings of friendship toward our parents are too flimsy a ground for filial duties, the friendship model can provide a plausible, robust account of filial obligations. (V) As for adult children who have never formed friendships with their loving, caring parents, and refuse to give them much‐needed assistance, they can be criticised by moral considerations independent of but compatible with the friendship model .",

A pesar de que quizas podria esperarse un comportamiento mas igualitario entre los adultos y los ninos (puesto que estos son presentados como expertos dignos de credito), el analisis muestra que se repiten comportamientos propios de los contextos ya conocidos: el adulto, por ejemplo, puede interrumpir a voluntad a los ninos y realizar continuas preguntas: los ninos, en cambio, no pueden interrumpir al adulto ni hacerle preguntas y respuestas se revela, ademas, como la estructura omnipresente en todo el intercambio, algo que no seria justificable de existir autentica igualdad entre los interlocutores. La realidad es que el propio contexto no favorece que se produzca esta igualdad. Al contrario, impone a los ninos unas exigencias estilisticas y comunciativas que estos no estan capacitados para afrontar, lo que se manifiesta en el incumplimiento de un buen numero de principios conversacionales. De hecho, podria decirse que es un contexto especialmente desigual, puesto que la interaccion que en el se produce entre el adulto y los ninos ni siquiera tiene a estos como destinatarios principales. Al contrario, el objetivo del adulto es en primer lugar contentar a la audiencia del programa, aunque esto suponga no hacer caso de las necesidades conversacionales de los ninos o incluso utilizarlas en beneficio de los espectadores (por ejemplo, aprovechando el potencial humoristico de las intervenciones infantiles). La conclusion final es que el debate televisivo nino-adulto comparte las mismas caracteristicas en cuanto a la desigualdad entre interlocutores que las que se han documentado en los contextos ya conocidos de conversacion",

      "abstract": "Divorce is one option exercised by parents who experience conflict with one another. Yet when both parents retain some involvement with their children after a divorce, they are required to continue a relationship as parents. Co-parenting may be active (e.g., parents interacting directly with one another to establish rules and expectations for the child or make decisions about the child's life) or passive (e.g., parents avoiding contact with one another but being available to parent when it is their \"turn\"). In either case, co-parenting necessitates continuing ties between the once-conflicting parties; thus, the opportunity for continued conflict remains. Furthermore, even (or perhaps especially) in instances where one parent has no contact with the rest of the family, angry or hostile feelings on the part of the remaining parent may create a residue of conflict that affects children.",

Le role d’une perturbation des relations mere-enfant dans l’etiologie de la malnutrition est souvent cite, mais rarement mis en evidence. L’etude s’efforce de mieux comprendre la structuration du lien entre les symptomes de l’enfant et certaines specificites comportementales et alimentaires caracteristiques de sa situation au quotidien. Les observations ecrites et filmees des interactions avec l’entourage de douze enfants - dont six souffrent de malnutrition - de 12 a 20 mois a Yaounde, au Cameroun, ont fait apparaitre les tendances suivantes : les enfants souffrant de malnutrition vivent dans un environnement plus instable et moins « chaleureux », reclament plus d’attention et (n’)obtiennent (que) davantage de contact alimentaire que les enfants bien portants de l’echantillon. Une prise en compte des dimensions psychosociales et culturelles de la malnutrition, complementaire des approches economiques et nutritionnelles plus repandues, peut permettre d’eviter l’ecueil qui consiste a « plaquer » un savoir ethnocentrique - meme techniquement exact - sur une realite meconnue. La mise en place de programmes plus cibles et appropries necessite le transfert de mecanismes adaptatifs, acceptes et familiers culturellement, d’un secteur de la population (familles d’enfants bien portants) a un autre (enfants souffrant de malnutrition).",

In the adoption of children over two years, this period may be even more complex, being key to a successful adoption. A study was conducted with three couples who adopted children over two years old, aiming to understand feelings, perceptions, doubts, anxieties, joys and difficulties experienced in the early days of cohabitation in the families formed by adoption. In these cases of late adoption, the analysis of interviews with couples revealed that many factors contributed to the success of the initial adaptation and of the adoption as a whole, highlighting the characteristics of adopters and children. On the child’s part, some aspects proved to be positive: knowing their adoption story in advance and being aware of the break with the family of origin. Regarding adopters, the facilitating factors were flexibility in relation to the peculiarities of adopting older children and respect to their characteristics, their ability to show affection, the attitude in relation to adoption, the inclusion of the child in the family’s social activities and support from the extended family. There were no complicating factors mentioned by the respondents about adaptation itself, but couples cited the delay in the implementation of the judgment of adoption as a factor generating anxiety. The study showed a positive facet of late adoption, demonstrating the potential feasibility and success in these situations.Keywords: late adoption, family, adaptation.",

Home observations on a sample of families revealed that mothers scoring above the mean used fewer communications in the form of directives and \"unmodified power\" and more communication in the form of praise and social conversation than mothers scoring below the mean. The mother's use of positive contact was related to her educational level, the birth order of the child and number of children in the family, the father's use of positive contact, and to a friendly outgoing pattern of child behavior. There was no relation to the mother's use of physical punishment, her protectiveness, her tendency to comply with the child's demands, or her child-rearing ideology and other attitudes. Child care workers are in a strategic position to educate parents about the importance of this kind of contact, especially with later-born children in large families.",

The first is the sort of home which is broken, vicious, where there is defective discipline, where the family relationships are defective (i.e., the relationships between the parents themselves and between parents and children) and where there is some personal disorder in the parents. The main characteristic of this kind of home is parental viciousness. The second type of home is not broken or vicious but there is defective discipline. The interparental relations are defective, there is some personal disorder in the parents, and the parentchild relationships are extremely bad.

These profiles were linked to mothers' and fathers' familism values, traditional patriarchal gender role attitudes, and socioeconomic status and to adolescents' friendship intimacy and risky behaviors measured longitudinally from early to late adolescence. Adolescent gender moderated the linkages between parents' involvement in adolescents' peer relationships and youth adjustment.",

Children’s predominant health lifestyles in our sample vary by focus on parent versus child identity expression and on future achievements versus present well-being. Parents expect health lifestyles to influence future socioeconomic attainment and health inequalities.

Although parental rules vary across families, children's ages, cul tures, and historical periods, most people know a rule when they hear one. Common rules for children in American families today include these: Don't hurt other people; do what your parents tell you to do; don't ask loudly in the grocery store, Why is that man so fat, Mommy?; don't play with the telephone; don't lie; come home on time; do your homework before you watch televi sion; and don't pester your sister.

A social role of a family comprises the active relationship of its senior members, especially the parents, in the process of socialization of the youngs - children and minors. In a process of resocialization, a proper positioning of family members represents the highest achievement in the realization of its social role. In such a way, a family gives an active contribution to affirming the positive social values. However, the expected social role of the family is often being corrupted by the deviant and criminal behavior of its junior members. Thus, this is a clear signal that the socialization was unsuccessful. The reasons may be found in its partial or complete deficiency. When a family fails to complete its role, then we have on the scene the members of the young population who do not comply with moral and legal norms. Consequently, they must be subjected to a process of resocialization. This process includes various subjects: the court, social welfare center, local community, school, family and the offender him/herself. They jointly participate in a resocialization process as a form of rehabilitation. Although in this process the family role is being realized within the legal frames (issued sentences or decisions), it is undisputable that it plays the important role. Hence, we find necessary to point out the specific role of the family as a factor in the socialization and resocialization process.",

      "abstract": "Children who experience parental divorce, compared with children in intact two-parent families, exhibit more conduct problems, more symptoms of psychological maladjustment, lower academic achievement, more social difficulties, and poorer self-concepts. Similarly, adults who experienced parental divorce as children, compared with adults raised in continuously intact two-parent families, score lower on a variety of indicators of psychological, interpersonal, and socioeconomic well-being. However, the overall group differences between offspring from divorced and intact families are small, with considerable diversity existing in children's reactions to divorce. Children's adjustment to divorce depends on several factors, including the amount and quality of contact with noncustodial parents, the custodial parents' psychological adjustment and parenting skills, the level of interparental conflict that precedes and follows divorce, the degree of economic hardship to which children are exposed, and the number of stressful life events that accompany and follow divorce. These factors can be used as guides to assess the probable impact of various legal and therapeutic interventions to improve the well-being of children of divorce.",

      "abstract": "This article is based upon a survey of personal recollections of young people born in large families and of their parents. It suggests that the temporal socialization of children within their family may or may not contribute to the acquisition of behavioral dispositions aligned with the expectations of education institutions. It distinguishes between two types of intra-family socialization patterns that are socially differentiated. By observing how their parents act and by acting themselves, the children from upper middle-class families who took part in our survey learn to plan and anticipate activities, and to rationalize the use of their time. By being subjected to explicit rules and predictable, deferred and stable sanctions, they get also used to reflect upon their past actions and to anticipate the future. By contrast, children from lower middle-class families develop a more unpredictable and immediate relationship to time. For this group, more than the first, limitations – and in particular temporal limitations – therefore tend to be vested in their close relatives rather than in rules and objective arrangements. They are also dependent on the context within which the children act. This fosters a tendency to expect these limitations to manifest externally rather than a capacity to anticipate and regulate their own behavior accordingly.",

      "abstract": "It is only through the love and approval of the significant adults in a child's life that he is able to give up his primitive behavior for that which meets the demands of social living. Conflict over authority is only one of many conflicts. There are conflicts which arise inherently in a child's development. The task of the parents in the education of the child in our society is to enable the child to tolerate a certain amount of frustration and also a necessary degree of control of impulses so that he can live in a group and in conformity with the required standards. Increased rebelliousness and defiance are normally characteristic of certain periods of development in healthy children. These are when concerted discipline begins, and in early adolescence. But other events also may reactivate or stimulate attitudes of defiance and rebellion. Even in his rebellion, a child needs and expects his parents to stand for order, as well as for love. He expects that the parent will save him from the consequences of his own destructive impulses, which he as yet may not have the strength to withstand.Deep-seated or submerged factors in the parents may play a significant role in the discipline to which they subject their children. True permissiveness means allowing a child to develop according to his own rate of speed and his own potentialities as a unique individual. It includes refusing the child any type of behavior that will bring danger to him or to others.A parent who uses harsh and rigid forms of discipline may force a child into submission, rather than acceptance and understanding. This produces only surface conformity which hides insecurity and violent underlying destructiveness.",

      "title": "The Spouse and Familial Incest: An Adlerian Perspective.",
      "abstract": "A major component of Adlerian psychology concerns the belief in responsibility to self and others. In both incest perpetrator and spouse the basic underlying assumption of responsibility to self and others is often not present. Activities and behaviors occur in a social context and as such need to be regarded within a social context that may serve to help understand behaviors. The role of the spouse in incest has been variously described as enabling and non-supportive. Incest is at once catastrophic to the victim, devastating to sibling bystanders, incapacitating to the spouse, and damaging to the perpetrator. The need for further attention to spousal dynamics in incest is overdue: the victim and perpetrator have claimed the most attention to the neglect of the spouse and her role. Spouses are often awarded sole custody of incested children and while the perpetrator may be removed from the home due to legal action, or serve time in a prison setting, the spouse remains in the home. To remove the proximal cause of incest is not sufficient to guarantee the future safety of the victim. Spousal dynamics need examination and attention to prevent further, subsequent reinvesting of the victim, or a perpetuation of the dynamics that could lead to younger siblings being victimized.

      "abstract": "The article describes the issue of social, professional, complex adaptation, integration of people with disabilities into socio-economic relations. It is indicated that the Ukrainian society is not ready to accept people with disabilities in the workplace after they complete the educational process and obtain a certain profession by specialty. Society is not ready, because no one has prepared it so far in the inclusive direction of accepting people with special needs. It is indicated that the acceptance of people with disabilities into society at an adult age encounters problems from both sides. On the part of society, there are no levers for the implementation of legally defined guarantees of observing the rights and freedoms of people with disabilities to obtain a workplace. On the other hand, the presence of people with disabilities in social isolation due to their constant special needs for care and guardianship affects their relationship to the real world: interest is extremely rare, the desire to be included in possible processes is almost always, ignoring society and focusing on one's own illness. often. In such conditions, the task of society is determined by the creation of an inclusive environment for the integration of people at workplaces. It was emphasized that in Ukraine, the Ministry of Social Policy created the platform \"FREE! [employment]\" and the pilot project \"Helping Hand\", which are aimed at creating an inclusive socio-economic space for people with disabilities. In the course of the research, general methods of scientific study were used, namely: comparison, description, observation, analogy. Also, special methods of study were applied, namely a systematic approach and structural-functional analysis, synthesis, generalization.",

      "abstract": "The problem of transformations undergone by the family environment in the countries of the post-industrial economy is analysed. The most significant highlighted changes are those related to the reduction of quantitative and generational composition of a family, weakening of the idea of child-centrism, search for new models of active parenting, slow growing up of children in the comfort of a modern family environment. The socio-evolutionary nature of changes in the family standard, determined by the level of economic, social and cultural development of society, is emphasized. It is shown that the new social situation of parenthood is determined by fundamental changes in the architecture of socio-economic relations in post-industrial society. It is characterized by two main trends: an increase in the number of unemployed young women seeking self-realization in the field of parenthood, and an active family care for the future of the child in a highly competitive society. The risks of personal development of children associated with the implementation of the model of active parenthood are: reducing the initiative, responsibility and independence of modern adolescents and young men. It is suggested that active parenthood has an impact on the composition of the family environment, which is now determined not only by family ties and relationships, but also by the ideological proximity of its members. Real and networked parent communities not only expand the environment of the modern family, but also work out the variable models of parenthood, filling the empty niche of the social standard of family education.",

Studies of non-disabled siblings in these families have indicated both emotional risks and perceived benefits. Little is known about how out-of-home placement of the child with retardation affects the siblings. Adolescent siblings of children with retardation living at home (N = 25) or in residential placement (N = 20) were contrasted with siblings of children without retardation (N = 28), on measures obtained from their mothers and themselves. Despite their different situations, these siblings were highly similar on measures of psychological adjustment, self-esteem, and family environment. Sibling relationships, however, were less intense, with less warmth but also lower conflict, in families where the child lived out of the home. Most siblings of children with retardation reported positive personal growth experiences while also expressing realistic concerns about the future. Siblings of children with retardation had beliefs and attitudes about placement that were highly consistent with the child's current living situation.",

Engaging in social interaction and including recreational activities appear to have a significant effect in diminishing the burden of caregiving. The present study pertains to social support and its relationship to quality of life overall among caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients (M age=72.4 years). The author examined the relationships of caregiver burden, social support, and quality of life in caregivers with geographically local or distant relatives (N=144). Working from the assumption that having local support of relatives or others considered to constitute the support system would alleviate at least some caregiver burden, and that those with distant relatives would perceive less support, the authors found that those with formal interventions from a social service agency equally perceived adequate support despite the geographic location of relatives. The author concluded that the geographic distance of relatives who provide social support does not significantly impact the caregiver’s perceived quality of life; thus, local support may sometimes take the place of relative or family support to caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Divorce is an increasingly present social phenomenon in everyday life, a significant number of children being exposed to its effects. As a natural consequence of divorce, in families with one or more children, there is the issue of child custody, aspect in which most of the times there are some disputes. Following the separation of the marital couple, the relationship between the child and his/ her parents has two different aspects: either the child maintains a natural relationship with both of his/ her parents, or, due to his/ her involvement in the prolonged post-divorce conflict between parents, he/ she suffers an impairment of the relationship with one of the parents. The extreme form of harming the relationship between the child and one of the parents is parental alienation. Parental alienation occurs when one of the parents deliberately interferes with the relationship of the child with the other parent. This parental intervention involves behaviors of denigrating the alienated parent, reducing the contact between the child and the alienated parent, leading to rejection of the alienated parent by the child. This study aims to pursue, on the one hand, the determination of personality traits and the existence/ nonexistence of predisposition to personality disorders of the adults involved in a divorce case with minors, in relation to which the court suspects the establishment of the phenomenon of parental alienation, while on the other hand it pursues to identify significant differences in personality structuring and its possible disruptions between parents coming from divorced couples, from the perspec tive of the targeted parent and that of the alienating parent.",

It discusses the determinants of the rise in nonfamily households, testing whether it is due at least in part to normative changes in the family or simply to increases in economic opportunity that have allowed the realization of a constant demand for solitary or nonfamily living. Few studies of propensity to form nonfamily households have addressed the issue of housing; none have done so adequately. More affordable and/or available housing, like rising income, allows individuals to realize their desire to live alone. Young adults face several living arrangement options. They may remain in their family of origin, as \"child of head\", either married or part of a subfamily, or more commonly, as an unmarried person. The living arrangements decisions of young adults vary substantially, and reflect both differences in financial dimensions as well as tastes and preferences for family versus nonfamily living.",

This minority includes many of the psychiatrically ill, the mentally handicapped, the chronically sick and children (for instance, orphans). Although it is apparent that many of the disordered and abnormal behaviours found in these individuals are caused by internal pathology, it has also been demonstrated that significant aspects of their behaviour are maintained by the social environment within the institution. The previous chapter suggested that the outcome in schizophrenia is influenced by the patient's family. Research on chronic schizophrenia, involving long-stay patients in hospital, has similarly demonstrated that behaviours such as social withdrawal and inactivity are determined as much by unstimulating ward environments as by any biological process. When ward environments are improved, many problematic behaviours subside in both number and severity. The key to change can therefore involve environmental alteration as much as individual treatment, and institutions become a natural focus for the clinician who is keen to improve the welfare of his patients.",

In contrast to the original model, which only discusses 1 type of acculturation gap, there are at least 4 types of acculturation gaps: (1) the child is &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; acculturated than the parent in the &lt;i&gt;host&lt;/i&gt; culture, (2) the child is &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; acculturated than the parent in the &lt;i&gt;host&lt;/i&gt; culture, (3) the child is &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; acculturated than the parent in the &lt;i&gt;native&lt;/i&gt; culture, and (4) the child is &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; acculturated than the parent in the &lt;i&gt;native&lt;/i&gt; culture.

Participation in higher education is modelled separately for men and women. Being enrolled in education is often considered incompatible with family formation. For men at least some of the estimated negative effects of early family formation are weaker. The choice of higher education can also be a reaction to life events within or outside the family. The human capital approach would lead to a somewhat different question, namely whether enrolment differences between family circumstances change with age. An alternative explanation is that family circumstances with higher interruption rates also have a high inflow during university enrolment. Transition rate models for the beginning of full-time university studies and the interruption of full-time studies are estimated. Multivariate models are estimated for taking up and interrupting tertiary level education.",

      "abstract": "Studies exploring caring of autistic children tend to focus on the nuclear family. Relatively little is known about the role of extended family members. This is especially important in countries like China, where family support is highly valued and families often live in extended family households. We used semi-structured interviews with 16 Chinese parents of autistic children from diverse educational and income backgrounds and focus group discussions with 11 service providers, to explore their perspectives of the role of extended relatives in the care of autistic children. Using template thematic analysis, we developed three themes: (1) Unambiguous active support from extended relatives: “my siblings and parents always remind me to take good care of my child”; (2) Complex or ambivalent support: “when it comes to grandparents, things can get complicated”; (3) Disengagement in care or stigmatising attitudes: “I felt they didn’t see my son as worthy”. Extended relatives’ supportive or unsupportive roles were perceived to be linked with the timing of a child’s diagnosis, early intervention opportunities, parents’ social and mental well-being, and family functioning. Each theme also considers the underlying individual and family characteristics that may influence the extended relatives’ willingness to support the autistic children and their parents. More effort is needed to help extended relatives better understand autism. This may include building on support from relatives who were already helpful, turning limited supporters into active partners, and addressing negative attitudes to reduce stigma; targeted support is especially needed for families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "abstract": "Global population aging has led to considerable disquiet about future support for frail older people; however, the determinants are poorly understood. Moreover, most industrialized societies have witnessed considerable changes in family behavior (e.g., rises in divorce and declining fertility). Such trends may have adversely affected the support systems of older people; nonetheless, only recently has research begun to address this issue. Employing data from the longitudinal British Household Panel Survey (1991–2003) and the 1998 Indagine Multiscopo sulle Famiglie “Famiglia, soggetti sociali e condizione dell’infanzia,” we investigated the association between family disruptions due to divorce, separation, or death and three key dimensions of informal support: (i) frequency of contact with unrelated friends (among all respondents aged 65 years and over); (ii) co‐residence with children (among unmarried mothers aged 65 years and over); and (iii) regular or frequent help received from children (e.g., household assistance including care) among parents aged 65 years and over. In addition, we conducted a comparative investigation of the relationship between family disruptions and the use of home care services (i.e., health visitor or district nurse; home help; meals‐on‐wheels) among parents aged 65 years and over. Our findings suggest that in a culture like the U.K.'s, where relations between kin are primarily influenced by individualistic values, support in later life appears to be primarily related to need, whereas in societies with a strong familistic culture (like Italy's), support is received irrespective of the older person's individual characteristics.",

Palliative care nurses must practice the highest standards by delivering nonbiased, nonjudgmental support to patients and families; however, nurses may experience moral distress if their personal values conflict with a family's decisions and needs. This case focuses on a family receiving community-based palliative care for a child with a genetic life-limiting disease. They had a family history of this disease, which had caused the deaths of previous children, and the mother had a current unplanned pregnancy. The care team overcame language barriers and cultural obstacles to establish a trusting relationship with the vulnerable pregnant mother. They were able to support her decision to terminate her pregnancy safely by helping her to navigate a complex health care system. Using 5 crucial pillars to assist health care members with the delivery of nonjudgmental family-centered palliative care is recommended: (1) identification of biases, (2) utilization of a culturally safe approach, (3) effective communication, (4) assessment and support, and (5) knowledge of community resources.",

      "abstract": "In Chapter 1, based on the notion of emerging adulthood, we define adult entrenched dependence as a failure to emerge. Children’s dependence on their parents can be characterized as functional or dysfunctional. We propose ways to differentiate between the two. We clarify that the goal of our approach is not fostering \"independence\" (which we view as a rather problematic goal) but helping transform dysfunctional into functional dependence. The main changes we try to promote are: (a) developing a time perspective that allows parents to strive for better functioning; (b) helping parents transition from personal effacement into presence; (c) releasing parents from their \"sacrifice mentality\" in favor of recommitment to wellness; (d) helping parents counter the adult-child's entitlement; and (e) identifying and resisting various forms of violence, blackmail and exploitation.",

It was investigated whether the two groups differed in their interaction with the mother (in intimacy, requests, harshness, neglect and giving).The results showed that based on the structure of the families there was no difference in satisfaction of family life, and that family satisfaction was strongly connected with the type of interaction rather than the structure of the family.In the dimension of interaction which reflect the expressive functions, there was no difference between the mothers of groups of young boys or girls from complete or deficient families. The structure of the families was modified only by the dimension of demands which defined the instrumental function of the mother.",

      "title": "Understanding the Complexity of Practice in Kinship Foster Care",
      "abstract": "Dramatic growth in the number of children in state custody has been accompanied by an increasing use of kinship foster care-the placement of children in state custody with their relatives. Research on kinship foster care has not kept pace with the use of this placement option, although work to date suggests that children in kinship foster care remain in state custody longer and are less likely to be returned home or adopted than children in the care of nonrelatives. In-depth interviews with caseworkers serving children in kinship foster care revealed the complex nature of practice in this area and identified potential obstacles to permanency for these children. Results suggest practice principles that may facilitate permanency for these children. Dramatic growth in the number of abused, neglected, and dependent children placed with their relatives by the child welfare system has caught the attention of child welfare administrators, policymakers, and the general public. These are increasingly funded and regulated as a type of family foster care and referred to as relative foster care, kinship care, or kinship foster care [Berrick et al.1994; Child Welfare League of America 1994; Gleeson & Craig 1994; Kusserow 1992a,1992b; National Commission on Family Foster Care 1991]. The child welfare field has been caught off guard by the sharp increase in the use of kinship foster care since 1985, particularly in Illinois, New York, and California, where the number of children in kinship foster care exceeds or approximates the number of children placed with nonrelative licensed foster parents [Goerge et al. 1995; Kusserow 1992a]. Historically, many African American children have been successfully reared by extended family members [Hill 1977; Martin & Martin 1978; Stack 1974]. Many Latino and Asian families involve grandparents, godparents, and others in the care of children and in decision making and planning in behalf of these children [Lum 1986]. These informal kinship care relationships have generally operated without the oversight or support of the publicly funded child welfare system. It is not yet clear what happens when a formal child welfare service is superimposed over the informal practice of kinship care or whether public child welfare policies that guide family foster care are relevant to this new formal child welfare service [Gleeson & Craig 1994]. These policies stress achievement of permanent homes for children through rapid reunification of children with their parents, or adoption of children by their foster parent or some other suitable adult. Prevailing family foster care practice models were developed in the 1970s to facilitate permanency through a child's return home or adoption [Emlen et al. 1978; Pike et al. 1977; Stein et al. 1978; Stein & Gambrill 1985]. It is not known whether these practice models are relevant to kinship foster care or even whether permanency can be best defined by a child's return home or adoption when a child is living in kinship foster care. Research in kinship foster care is only in its beginning phase and has not kept pace with the dramatic growth in this service [Barth 1994; Berrick & Barth 1994; Dubowitz 1994]. We do know that kinship placements have been concentrated in large urban centers and have been used predominantly with economically disadvantaged children of color and their families [Berrick et al.1994; Kusserow 1992a; Testa 1992, 1993; Wulczyn & Goerge 1992]. Placements with relatives have been less likely to disrupt and tend to last longer than nonrelative placements [Goerge 1990; Testa 1992; 1993; Wulczyn & Goerge 1992]. These placements have also resulted in lower rates of reunification and adoption [Barth et al. 1994; Thornton 1991]. One study, however, suggests that reentry rates are lower for children who return home to their families of origin after placement in kinship foster care [Barth et al. 1994]. Several studies have reported that children in kinship foster care have significant physical, mental health, behavioral, and educational problems, but receive fewer services than children placed in nonrelative family foster care [Berrick et al. …",

The message was accompanied by an appeal that was either a control or was altruistic (other-oriented: focusing on the mother/caregiver's well-being) or egoistic (self-oriented: focusing on the child of the caregiver's needs and feelings). Participants who received an altruistic appeal were more appreciative of caregiving stresses than were those given an egoistic or a control appeal. Increasing family members' awareness of the stress involved in family caregiving is a first step in encouraging them to personally intervene on behalf of the caregiver.",

We found that aging mothers were highly involved in the relocation process and had frequent contact and continued emotional involvement with their adult child. Mothers became increasingly satisfied with their level of contact with their child over time, less worried about the future, and had decreasing levels of direct caregiving and contact with residential staff. Adult siblings reported improved sibling relationships over time. Siblings whose brother or sister moved out of the parental home increased their shared activities and felt less pessimistic about the future.

Peculiarities and character of all these processes are brightly expressed at the adolescence, when mental abilities, social and psychological individualities are being formed and society standards are being mastered. Apart from age-related psychological changes mass media and other forms of popular culture exert great influence on teenager individuality. They mainly affect lifestyle and value forming of adolescence. We may now observe sharp decrease of moral values meaning among youth. The number of incomplete or problem families has grown, and the parents in such families are hardly capable of bringing up their offspring. Children raised in such families are automatically categorised into the “group of risk”, this means that they need psychological and pedagogical assistance. Usually parents are looking for such type of assistance in different educational institutions. The impact of the educational process on students’ personal development and mental peculiarities on different stages of tuition is traditionally relevant in psychological researches. Despite some outstanding researches of native scientists, which helped to understand psychological patterns of student’s personal development in the context of education as leading activity (L. Vygodskiy, D. Elkonin, L. Bozhovich and others), the modern childhood along with its deep changes have been actualized in researches of psycho-pedagogical problems of student’s personality formation by D. Feldstein.",

      "abstract": "The way mothers with young children organise themselves between work and family life takes on various forms depending upon the families’ characteristics and the context in which they made their choices. Studying the reasons behind the types of childcare chosen as explained by the families leads to questioning the traditional economic analyses based upon financial arbitration: above all, the choices stem from a demand for quality childcare services in which the child will flourish and are often constrained by the offer (lack of room, unavailability of the service requested, refusal). Over 12% of families are unsatisfied with the type of care for which they settled. We notably demonstrate that working part time does not always facilitate reconciliation and can, on the contrary, make it more difficult when it is constrained, associated with atypical or irregular hours, and brings in a low level of income.",

      "abstract": "Waarom clustert deviant gedrag (gedrag dat afwijkt van gangbare sociale normen, zoals agressief of crimineel gedrag) in bepaalde families? En wat zijn effectieve strategieën zijn om dergelijke patronen te doorbreken? Dit zijn vragen die Veroni Eichelsheim stelt in haar oratie. Complex samenspel Intergenerationele continuïteit – oftwel de mate waarin ouderlijk gedrag de kans beïnvloedt dat kinderen soortgelijk gedrag zullen vertonen – is een complex samenspel tussen individuele kenmerken, genetische, sociale, en socio-economische mechanismen, in interactie met bredere maatschappelijke of historische ontwikkelingen. Goede timing Interveniëren bij problematiek blijkt een lastige opgave, zeker in een doelgroep die vaak wars is van instanties of onzichtbaar blijft voor hulpverlening. Terwijl de timing van interventies belangrijk is: vroeg ingrijpen, maar niet té vroeg. Bovendien worden interventies in deze groep niet alleen vrijwillig uitgevoerd, maar ook onvrijwillig: door een rechter opgelegd. Die onvrijwilligheid van interveniëren brengt een spanningsveld met zich mee tussen het bieden van zorg en pedagogische ondersteuning enerzijds, en repressie anderzijds. Samenwerking tussen disciplines Om de komende jaren doorbraken te bereiken, is een goede samenwerking tussen disciplines zoals ontwikkelingspsychologie, criminologie en sociologie maar ook de rechtsgeleerdheid van essentieel belang. Alleen als we de complexe mechanismen onderliggend aan intergenerationele continuïteit én veerkracht beter begrijpen, kunnen we effectievere interventies ontwikkelen. Interventies met bij voorkeur een lange opvolgduur: over de levensloop en misschien wel over generaties. Veroni Eichelsheim bekleedt de bijzondere leerstoel ‘Intergenerationele continuïteit van deviant gedrag’, ingesteld door het Nederlands Studiecentrum Criminaliteit en Rechtshandhaving (NSCR) en de Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. Het doel van deze leerstoel is te onderzoeken waarom deviant gedrag (gedrag dat afwijkt van gangbare sociale normen, zoals agressief of crimineel gedrag) clustert in bepaalde families én wat effectieve strategieën zijn om dergelijke patronen te doorbreken.",

      "abstract": "Violation of the psychological space, in the form of separation from family, has a negative impact on the core of the child’s personality. In institutions in the public education care, there are unified forms of joint activities (special style of behavior, appearance), which leads to a smoothing of the behavior differences between girls and boys. The problem of gender identity in such institutions in the public education is that children growing up in a family, as a rule, reproduce their parental family’s model, repeating or denying the behavior of a model father or mother. Negative family experience enables a child in the process of identity development to rethink it, to build its own view of himself as a man or a woman. In the context of institutions in the public education care, the process is complicated, and as a consequence, there is confused, uncertain gender identity, characterized by difficulties in development of appropriate gender and family roles. Assessment of correlation between the components of gender identity reveals the problem areas in personal development of adolescents in different social conditions.",

The dominant form of parental behavior in mammals is a uniparental maternal care system, where the mother raises her offspring by herself. A mother can form either a nonselective or selective bond with her infants, depending on the maturity of her infants at birth. A biparental care system, in which both maternal and paternal behavior occur, is present in about 5% of mammalian species. Approximately 3% of mammalian species exhibit a cooperative breeding system, where some offspring remain in their social group and help their parents raise subsequent offspring. The parental behavior of these helpers is referred to as alloparental behavior. The occurrence of paternal and alloparental behavior shows that alternative mechanisms, not requiring pregnancy and parturition, can evolve which allow for these forms of parental behavior.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: In our article, we addressed some of the questions raised by Dong and Simon regarding caregiving characteristics.1 We included only individuals with relatives who gave personal or instrumental help before hospitalization and who were identified by the elder person or by the family as the main caregivers.2 Table 1 shows the number of shared households of patients with caregivers (52.1%), mostly partners (34.9%), and the remainder children living with parents. Self-neglect is defined as the behaviors of an elderly person that threaten his or her own health or safety and excludes situations in which mentally competent older persons make conscious and voluntary decisions to engage in acts that threaten their health or safety.3 It is questionable whether self-neglect really is distinguishable from neglect by a responsible caregiver (when there are caregivers). Taking into account that most cases of self-neglect are due to cognitive deterioration, depression, or physical fragility, is it not the responsibility of the caregiver relation (spouse or an adult child) to provide the basic needs of these elderly people? In addition, strong family ties characterize Israeli society, and the majority of elderly patients have relatives living nearby; long-distance caregiving is exceptional. Israeli family caregivers are expected to provide the bulk of the necessary assistance, in addition to the formal home-care services that exist under the Community Long-term Care Law.4 The Expanded Indicator of Abuse is one of few structured instruments assessed for reliability and validity that use the three facets of abuse or risk for abuse identification. The present study stressed the essential need for a multifaceted identification of risk for abuse. Further research to extend our understanding of different types of abuse and its precursors and processes is needed.

Fathers without custody is a special group of single parent, families in Iceland (that relates to the social family profile, legislation, divorce rate and proportion of children born out of marriage). The main results of the fathers' situations, their complaints and wishes are presented. The fathers express more discontent with the custody arrangements than their visiting rights. For the other (single parent) groups family interaction is frequent and makes up a strong network of (social and emotional) support. The divorced fathers' marginal position in the family is reflected, i.e., in their restricted pattern of family interaction. The children of divorced parents lose more contact with their grandparents and other relatives in their fathers' family than with their mothers' family. The divorced fathers without custody have longer working hours and less good housing than the other groups. They express their unhappiness over loss of responsibility of their children, They suffer more than the other groups from sleep disturbances and sad thoughts.",

      "title": "Coparenting and Child Adjustment among Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Couples and their Adopted Children",
      "abstract": "Coparenting among heterosexual parents is associated with child behavior. Less is known, however, about coparenting and its associations with child adjustment in adoptive families with lesbian and gay parents. • In this study, associations among coparenting and child adjustment were explored among adoptive families headed by lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples using multiple assessments, including observational data. • Although significant differences in coparenting were found across couple type, all couples on average demonstrated more supportive than undermining coparenting behavior. • Couples who were more supportive than undermining also had children with fewer behavior problems, regardless of family type. • In sum, parental sexual orientation was associated with differences in parenting interaction, but not with differences in child outcomes. Introduction • Coparenting describes the ways in which two parents accomplish the tasks of childrearing together (McHale et al., 2000). • In heterosexual-parent families, qualities of coparenting have been found to be associated with child adjustment such that more supportive coparenting behaviors are related to fewer child behavior problems (e.g., McHale et al., 2002; Schoppe-Sullivan et al., 2009). • To date, coparenting and associations with child outcomes have not been extensively studied among adoptive families and families with lesbian and gay parents. Little observational data in this area exists. • The purpose of this study was to examine coparenting and child behavior in adoptive families headed by lesbian, gay, and heterosexual couples with young children. Method • Participants were 104 families (25 lesbian, 29 gay, and 50 heterosexual couples) with at least one adopted (via domestic, infant adoption) child (Mage = 3 years). Demographic information is presented in Table 1. • Observational data of family interaction were collected. Both parents and child engaged in a videotaped, free play session lasting ten minutes. • Dimensions of supportive and undermining coparenting behavior demonstrated during family play were analyzed using the Coparenting Behavior Coding Scale (Schoppe et al., 2001). • To assess child behavioral adjustment, parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist for 11⁄2 to 5 year olds (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000). • Hypothesis 1: Couples would differ in coparenting across family type, since previous coparenting literature on division of labor indicates that same-sex couples are more likely than heterosexual couples to report sharing rather than specializing in childcare (Peplau & Fingerhut, 2007). • Hypothesis 2: Regardless of family structure, more supportive coparenting interactions would be associated with better adjustment among children. Table 1. Demographic Information about Adoptive Families Figure 1. Coparenting behavior among adoptive parenting couples. Table 2. Correlations among Coparenting and Child Behavior Problems Note. Values represent Pearson r values. †.05 < p < .01. *p < .05. Results • Results showed that, overall, all couples demonstrated significantly higher levels of supportive rather than undermining behavior during family play (see Figure 1). • Several significant differences, however, were found among couples in coparenting (see Figure 1). Lesbian couples were the most supportive, and gay couples the least. Heterosexual couples were the most undermining, and lesbian couples the least. • Thus, a unique profile of coparenting dynamics emerged for each family type. • Despite these differences, parents who demonstrated more supportive behaviors also had children with fewer problems, regardless of family type (see Table 2). • In particular, greater pleasure and interactiveness among parents were associated with fewer child externalizing problems. Greater interactiveness was also associated with fewer internalizing and total behavior problems among children (see Table 2). • In contrast, greater competition demonstrated by parents was associated with greater externalizing behavior problems among children (see Table 2). • These associations were not significantly different across family types. Discussion • In conclusion, families led by lesbian, gay, and heterosexual adoptive couples differed in coparenting behaviors. These findings may indicate how parental sexual orientation, as well as parent gender, may be linked with differences in parenting experiences of adoptive families. • For all families, however, supportive coparenting was significantly related to fewer behavior problems among children. • Taken together, the results suggest the importance of family processes to child outcomes in adoptive families with lesbian, gay, and heterosexual parents, over and above the influence of family structure and parental sexual orientation. • These findings contribute new information to developmental and family systems theory about how parental sexual orientation is related to family dynamics and child outcomes. The results may also inform policy and law regarding controversy about the adoption of children by lesbian and gay adults.",

Subjects included 36 families who had been separated or divorced only once, for 6 to 30 months, and had a child between 6 and 16 years old. The custodial parent completed questionnaires regarding family functioning, single parenting, occurrence and subjective evaluation of specific post-divorce events, one child's adjustment to the divorce, and parental divorce adjustment. Data were analyzed using hybrid (stepwise/hierarchical) multiple regression analyses. Sixty-three percent of families were high on the Cohesion and/or Democratic family style dimensions. These family styles were related to healthier, more supportive family relationships and clearer, more direct, communication among family members. Approximately 30 percent of families were high on the Conflict and/or Laissez-Faire family style dimensions. These latter dimensions related to less healthy family relationships and communication styles. Notably, significantly poorer child and/or parental functioning were associated to these latter families. The impact of competent custodial parenting on child and family adjustment to divorce is discussed.",

In addition, attention is drawn to the origins of social orphan-hood, namely, the general civilization processes that take place in under the influence of the devaluation of family values, the predominance of personal-achievable and he-donistic motivations compared to parental ones – both from men and from women.",

We examined these issues with parents of 3-to-10 year-old children (N = 483). Parents judged it to be important for children to apologize following both intentional and accidental morally-relevant transgressions, and they anticipated prompting apologies in both contexts, showing an 'outcome bias' (i.e., a concern for the outcomes of children's transgressions rather than for their underlying intentions). Parents viewed apologies as less important after children's breaches of social convention; parents recognized differences between social domains in their responses to children's transgressions. Irrespective of parenting style, parents were influenced in similar fashion by particular combinations of transgressions and victims, though permissive parents were least likely to anticipate prompting apologies. Parents endorsed different reasons for prompting apologies as a function of transgression type, suggesting that they attend to key features of their children's transgressions when deciding when to prompt apologies.",

People with an ASD have high levels of anxiety and a range of behaviours that create challenges for family carers. Interviews with forty carers in S ydney reveal how disruptive behaviours, including being noisy, hyperactive, obsessive and controlling, are very demanding for all carers. Carers have adapted home spaces, restricted and reduced patterns of employment and socialisation, and sometimes avoided the home, altering relationships between parents and other siblings. Home care for people with ASD has reduced the sense of home as a place of relaxation peace and stability, and, while providing a more caring environment for people with ASD , has contributed to the partial institutionalisation of the home.",

      "title": "Recurrence or Resilience: Do Childhood Experiences Affect Violence Suffered by Women in Adulthood?",
      "abstract": "Among women aged 20 to 59 in 2000, frequencies of childhood difficulties are strongly correlated with many aspects of their current or past life histories, such as: leaving home before the age of 18, precocious sexual activity, family life during adolescence (with both parents, with only one, with relatives, outside the family), father’s employment, current marital situation, number of unions and presence of children, occupational status… While women’s lives have been affected by serious conflicts with their parents, confrontation with their quarrels and violence as well as divorce and separation, and material deprivation, torture, repeated beating and sexual abuse during childhood and youth appear to have the most serious consequences. All childhood difficulties increase the risk of adult violence, in public as in the home or the workplace. In particular, victims or witnesses of physical or sexual assault during their youth are more likely than others to suffer the same violence in adult life. Psychological violence inflicted by a spouse or in the workplace is also closely related to serious childhood events. Between reproduction and resilience, however, the debate remains open, since women who have undergone a difficult childhood are by no means all adult victims of violence.",

Parmi ces enfants, ceux qui présentent une douance associée à un trouble neurodéveloppemental (double exceptionnalité; 2e) tendent à rencontrer plus de difficultés. Or, aucune étude ne semble avoir vérifié si cette différence trouve son équivalent dans le vécu parental, les difficultés des parents d’enfants doués et 2e demeurant peu étudiées. Cette étude quantitative vise à décrire et comparer l’intensité perçue des difficultés rencontrées par 259 parents d’enfants doués et 2e au Québec, dans cinq volets de leur expérience (exercice de leur rôle parental, gestion des particularités de l’enfant, vécu familial, accompagnement du vécu scolaire de l’enfant, vécu social). Les particularités émotionnelles de l’enfant, l’accès à des programmes scolaires adaptés et le soutien des instances décisionnelles semblent être les plus grandes sources de difficultés pour les deux groupes de parents. Des analyses comparatives révèlent que les parents d’enfants 2e vivent significativement plus de difficultés que les parents d’enfants doués pour certains aspects de l’exercice du rôle parental, du vécu familial, de l’accompagnement scolaire de l’enfant, ainsi que face à certaines caractéristiques de l’enfant. Aucune différence n’est cependant observée quant au vécu social. Les résultats mettent en lumière l’importance de mieux comprendre l’expérience méconnue de ces parents de même que les cibles à prioriser dans le soutien à leur offrir.",

      "title": "Attachment Classification from the Perspective of Infantaregiver Relationships and Infant Temperament",
      "abstract": "Recently a number of investigators have suggested that classification differences in the Ainsworth Strange Situation (anxious and secure patterns of attachment) may be due largely or in part to endogenous temperamental variation. In doing so, these investigators have suggested a dimensional-trait approach in place of a qualitatively different taxonomic approach. Moreover, much evidence is directly contrary to a strong temperament interpretation of attachment patterns (changing attachments, differing attachments with different caregivers, prospective data on the early characteristics of infants later classified as securely or anxiously attached). Other interactionist temperament models currently have not been tested sufficiently. At the same time, a host of research findings support the interpretation that Ainsworth assessments capture aspects of the relationship between infant and caregiver, as derived from the history of their interaction. This includes direct evidence from observations of infants and mothers over time, the influence of varying patterns of care within and between cultures, the impact of factors presumed to influence quality of care (e.g., social support, life stress, caregiver family history), and predictions of later parent behavior from strange situation assessments of infant behavior. The importance of understanding attachment as a relational concept is twofold: it represents a theoretical and paradigmatic shift of importance for many aspects of developmental psychology, and it opens the way for more productive research on temperament, the interaction between temperament and experience, and important process studies of the unfolding of the infant-caregiver relationship.",

      "title": "Jurisdictional Boomerang: How the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act Amplifies Hardship for Domestic Violence Survivors",
      "abstract": "When a domestic violence survivor chooses to flee her home state with her children, her decision to seek refuge from an abusive partner can trigger countless consequences—personal, financial, and legal. She could be accused of kidnapping her children across state lines. Her decision to leave could result in a court order authorizing her children to return to the abusive partner. She could also lose her job or become homeless because of the time and resources she expends litigating an interstate custody dispute.\r\n\r\nThis predicament inadvertently forces her to decide between two desolating options. She can return to the dangerous situation in the state from which she just fled. But in that state, she is unlikely to have the social group and support system she needs. She is also likely to be financially vulnerable. And if she is forced to return to the home state, the high rate of recidivism in domestic violence cases will likely cause her, and perhaps her children, to experience further violence at the hands of an abusive partner. \r\n\r\nIf this survivor chooses not to return, however, she might find herself embroiled in a complex interstate child custody dispute that financially saddles her and requires her to defend herself in multiple forums. To make matters worse, the UCCJEA’s shortcomings, both in its inherent procedural features and application in state courts, can intensify her personal trauma, exacerbate her legal issues, and even violate her federal and constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nThis Article articulates the unique procedural issues that specifically affect domestic violence survivors in interstate child custody litigation. In actions where survivors flee across state lines with their children to escape abuse, they must overcome several procedural hurdles in order to maintain or obtain custody of their children. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”) is the uniform statute that governs how a court makes procedural determinations in child custody actions after one parent moves their children from the children’s home state to another state (hence “interstate” child custody disputes). In child custody actions where domestic violence is a pertinent factor, the UCCJEA causes unique problems for survivors. This Article describes this phenomenon as jurisdictional boomerang: a scenario where a domestic violence survivor is forced, because of a court’s jurisdictional determinations under the UCCJEA, to return to the state in which her abuser resides after she has fled to another state to keep herself and her children safe from further harm. \r\n\r\nThis Article offers two solutions to eradicate jurisdictional boomerang. The first solution proposes revisions to the UCCJEA’s statutory construction and provisions. These changes can enhance state courts’ ability to make fair jurisdictional determinations under the UCCJEA. The second solution outlines a mechanism for federal courts to step in when interlocutory decrees issued by state courts or action on the part of state officials acting under color of state law violate survivors’ rights under federal law or the Constitution.",

      "abstract": "Research on divorce has found that adolescents’ feelings of being caught between parents are linked to internalizing problems and weak parent‐child relationships. The present study estimates the effects of marital discord, as well as divorce, on young adult offspring's feelings of being caught in the middle ( N = 632). Children with parents in high‐conflict marriages were more likely than other children to feel caught between parents. These feelings were associated with lower subjective well‐being and poorer quality parent‐child relationships. Offspring with divorced parents were no more likely than offspring with continuously married parents in low‐conflict relationships to report feeling caught. Feelings of being caught appeared to fade in the decade following parental divorce. These results suggest that, unlike children of divorce, children with parents in conflicted marriages (who do not divorce) may be unable to escape from their parents’ marital problems—even into adulthood.",

Individuals who have spouses, children, or less time‐flexible occupations are expected to be less willing and likely to participate in collective action because familial and occupational commitments can reduce the amount of time and energy available for activism and increase the risks associated with it. Theoretically, biographical availability should be more significant in cases of costly or risky social activism, with costs referring to the time, money, and energy requirements of participation and risk referring to the anticipated dangers of participation, such as physical harm or social, financial, and legal repercussions (McAdam 1986). For example, while signing petitions does not involve significant time away from work or children, participating in protest events does, and because this activity could result in arrest, there is potentially an additional risk for those who are employed or who are primary caregivers of children.",

      "title": "Parents' child-rearing style and child's sociometric status.",
      "abstract": "This study examined relationships between parents' child-rearing style, the child's prosocial behavior, and the child's sociometric status. The sample consisted of 112 children (6-11 years of age) and both their parents. Parental behavior in the interaction with the child was observed at home when parents and child worked together in 2 structured tasks. Factor analyses of parental behavior revealed that 2 factors, Authoritative/Democratic and Authoritarian/Restrictive, can be found in the subsamples of mothers and fathers. These 2 dimensions of maternal and paternal behavior appeared to be predictive of both the child's prosocial behavior and sociometric status. Results are discussed in terms of the possible link between parent and peer systems. A child's acceptance by a peer group plays an important role in his or her social and personality development. Peer rejection seems to be a reasonably stable phenomenon (Coie & Dodge, 1983; Rogosch & Newcomb, 1989) and is predictive of later social maladjustment (Cowen, Pederson, Babigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973; Parker & Asher, 1987). Most of the research concerned with the determinants of a child's sociometric status in the peer group have focused primarily on children's behavioral and social cognitive characteristics. The role that parents may play in the development and maintenance of their child's sociometric status was generally ignored, although it is logical to assume that at least some of a child's social skills necessary for successful interaction with peers are learned through the parent-child interactions (Hartup, 1979). Several studies showed that a child's sociometric status in the peer group is related to socialization factors present in the parent-child system (Finnie & Russell, 1988; MacDonald, 1987; MacDonald & Parke, 1984; Parke et al., 1989; Peery, Jensen, & Adams, 1985; Putallaz & Heflin, 1990; Roopnarine & Adams, 1987). Very few studies, however, examined the mediating link in this relationship. What aspects of social competence do children learn in the parent-child setting that transfer directly or indirectly to their relationship with peers? One possibility that has been examined in recent research is that parent-child interaction influences children's sociometric status by affecting the child's social cognitive (or processing) skills, including social problem solving (Pettit, Dodge, & Brown, 1988; Putallaz, 1987) and the child's expectations of the outcome of social strategies (Hart, Ladd, & Burleson, 1990). However, in the context of the family, the child acquires not only many of the social cognitive skills, but also a behavioral pattern that might be important for a successful adaptation to",

      "title": "Worth Fighting For: The Correlates, Context, and Consequences of Avoiding Versus Enacting Domestic Labor Conﬂict",
      "abstract": "Domestic labor conflict arises when parties have incompatible goals or interests with regard to the achievement of household and care-related tasks. This can include household \"chores,\" such as cooking and laundry, as well as care for children and other dependents. Common sources of domestic labor conflict include dissatisfaction with the cleanliness of the home, perceived unfairness in household labor performance, desire for one or more parties to increase their performance and responsibility for domestic tasks, and complaints and disputes about standards for the performance of domestic tasks and care work. Domestic labor conflict has been most often studied among heterosexualcohabiting and married couples, and to a lesser extent among homosexual couples, roommates, and siblings. Although the study of domestic labor conflict has primarily concerned conflict over the tasks contained within one household or within a family's shared space, domestic labor conflict also arises between parties who do not share living space, such as between individuals who co-parent one or more children but live in separate residences, or adult siblings providing care for aging family members. Research on domestic labor conflict has a decades-long history and is multi-disciplinary, with contributions from scholars in the fields of sociology, economics, family studies, gender studies, psychology and communication. Domestic labor conflict research often focuses on the relationship of conflict behavior to relational outcomes (e.g., satisfaction), personal health outcomes (e.g., stress, immune function), and the ability to affect change in labor allocation. Given the importance of domestic labor to family functioning, and considering that domestic labor conflicts interpenetrate issues of relational power and identity, family/household decision-making, and material resources and rewards (e.g., personal comfort, leisure time), the study of domestic labor conflict has thepotential to greatly improve interpersonal relating among spouses and family members. In this chapter, we focus on domestic labor conflict that is enacted among heterosexual cohabiting and married couples.",

Such children are those whose families have been unable to provide an ongoing home and who have entered the system of child-care administered by the state. Either because of requests for help in taking care of a child from overwhelmed families or because of state intervention to remove a child from an abusive home, these children become the responsibility of social work agencies and are in residential homes or foster-placements, and some ultimately in adoptive homes. Within this group, the children referred for psychotherapeutic assessment are not usually those for whom there are hopes and plans for rehabilitation within the family of origin, but those for whom long-term alternative plans are being or have been made. They are the children who have not been helped enough by being offered alternative care, and whose psychological distress is evident either through their own visible unhappiness and difficulties in living, or through the disturbing effect they have on their carers and the wider world.",

First Nations parents are over represented. There is often a presumptive bias that individuals with disabilities, including FASD, are not capable of raising their children. Such a bias is unwarranted. Assessing FASD parents requires a view of functional capacity along with consideration of how the parent could accomplish the role and if needed, with what supports. Both a context and process for Parenting Capacity Assessments (PCAs) in these cases is recommended. There is a need for the assessments to exist within a cultural context, including the use of the Medicine Wheel. The individualistic perspective of most Canadian child welfare systems may not match the collectivistic approach to parenting in an Aboriginal family system although it is from the former position that most PCAs are conducted.",

      "title": "Adolescence: an anthropological inquiry",
      "abstract": "An Anthropological Definition of AdolescenceAn anthropological definition of adolescence, in common with psychological and sociological definitions, recognizes adolescence as a social stage intervening between childhood and adulthood in the passage through life.(We will have more to say about a second stage, youth, in some but not all societies.)Adolescence can be seen as a period of social role learning and restructuring: not simply a period in which early learning is crystallized, but rather one in which unlearning and new learning take place.Along with training for specific roles, there is learning in the sense of cognitive and affective reorganization away from the behavioral modes of childhood and toward adult modes.The child is characterized by dependency, subordination, and social asexuality, even as these vary across cultures.As his social scope, responsibilities, and expectations enlarge, the adolescent assumes greater autonomy, more of a peer relationship with same-sex adults, and an interest in sexual activities.Such unlearning and relearning is unlikely to be without cost to adolescents or to their families, who must also undergo changes in the ways they respond to their maturing children.To be successful, socialization must be both responsive and anticipatory, that is, it must help the individual both to operate in the present and to prepare for the future.Anticipatory socialization becomes accelerated sometime after about age 10, when major changes are propelling the individual toward biological adulthood; yet the young person is not a full adult and does not receive whatever respect and deference are due to adults of the same sex and social status.There is a certain ambiguity to the conflicting goals of adolescent socialization, which seek to maintain some of the subordination and dependency of childhood while moving the adolescent toward adulthood.Possibly this ambivalence accounts for the social awkwardness so typical of adolescents around the world.Much of their psychological discomfort and lack of social poise may result from these conflicting socialization goals.Unlearning and relearning are necessary because of the particular biological and social characteristics of our species.One consequence of the long period of immaturity is that dependency, necessary for survival, is deeply engrained in the child.The child's strongest bonds are to the family, yet the incest taboo and customs that militate against incest direct the adolescent to consider or actively pursue the formation of an intimate bond with someone outside this close circle.The fact that human beings live in socially integrated communities rather than as social isolates or in isolated families means that, at some point before full adulthood, young people must prepare for an active role in the community.In anticipating the social and sexual relationships and responsibilities of adult life, the adolescent is shifting focus away from a predominant attention to the household and toward attention to both the household and the community, from members of the family to persons who will 230 ADOLESCENCE majority of all food.The information on agriculture usually specifies one of three types of cultivation: cereal grains, root crops, or tree crops.Cereal grains include wheat, millet, rice, and corn.Root crops include yams, cassava, and potatoes.Tree crops include plantains, coconuts, and bananas.Additional information when applicable specifies that cultivation is on permanent fields, with irrigation, or with plow animals.Abipon 183 or Mepene, the Chaco, northeastern Argentina, 27° to 29°S, 59° to 60°W, 1750, after having acquired horses introduced to South America by the Spaniards.Raiders of Spanish settlements, nomadic, independent communities, Christian influence, hunting, also gathering and cattle husbandry.Abkhaz 55, Russian Caucasus, 42°50' to 43°25'N, 40° to 41 °35'E, 1880.A sedentary chiefdom, some are Christians or Moslems, primarily cattle herding, secondarily cultivating cereal grains.Ahaggaren 41 or Tuareg, Algeria, 21 ° to 25°N, 4° to 9°E, 1900, prior to French occupation.A small state of nomadic bands, Moslems, herding sheep, goats, and camels, also cultivating cereal grains and trading.Ainu 118 or Saru Ainu, southeastern Hokkaido, Japan, 42°40' to 43°30'N, 142° to 144°E, 1880, prior to Japanese colonization.Dispersed, independent communities, technologically primitive, fishing, also hunting and gathering.Ajie 103, New Caledonia and Loyalty Islands, east of Australia, 21 °20'S, 165°40'E, 1845, prior to European influence.A small chiefdom of sedentary villages, cultivating root crops, also fishing and trading.Aleut 123, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, 53° to 57°30'N, 158° to 170°W, 1778, prior to pervasive Russian influence.Chiefdom, fishing.Alorese 89 or Abui, island of Alor, Indonesia, between Java and New Guinea, 8°20'S, 124°40'E, 1938, under Dutch rule.A small chiefdom of sedentary small communities in the mountains, cultivating cereal grains and root crops.Amahuaca 170, eastern Peru, 10°30'S, 72° W, 1960, almost completely unacculturated.Independent groups in small sedentary but impermanent communities, primarily cultivating cereal grains, secondarily hunting.Amhara 37, central Ethiopia, 11 ° to 14°N, 36° to 38°45'E, 1953.A large nation of sedentary villages, Coptic Christians, cultiving cereal grains with plow animals, also milking cows and trading.Andamanese 79, islands east of India, 11 °45' to 12°N, 93° to 95° lO'E, 1860, prior to disruption by a penal colony established in 1858.Small nomadic independent communities on the seacoast, technologically primitive, fishing, also gathering and hunting.Aranda 91 or Arunta, central Australia, 23°30' to 25°S, 132°30' to 134°20'E, 1896.Small nomadic independent communities, technologically primitive, hunting, also gathering.Armenians 56, Russian Caucasus near Turkey, 40°10'N, 44°30'E, 1843, ruled by Russia, prior to political disruption in the late nineteenth century.A numerous ethnic minority, Christians, primarily cultivating cereal grains with plow animals, secondarily milking cows.Focus is the city of Erivan and surrounding villages.",

With the creation of the Child and\r\nAdolescent Statute, in 1990, the process of adoption suffered significative modifications,\r\nseeking to guarantee every right of the infants, among them, the right to live into a family.\r\nHowever, there are children and adolescents who are abandoned and neglected by their\r\nbiological parents and extended family, which may result in their withdrawal from this social\r\ngroup, starting a journey which is marked by rejection.

      "abstract": "Premature birth and subsequent admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) cause disengagement or delay in the mother-infant attachment process (13).Usually, the mother of a premature infant is not ready to be separated from the fetus.This early separation causes fear for infant's safety and health and increases the risk of psychological problems such as anxiety and depression in mothers which can negatively affect the mother-infant interaction (14-18).On the other hand, the feeble nature of premature infants makes them passive in situations of mother-child interaction and disrupts the mother-child bonding process (19).Studies have shown that there is a disruption to the attachment process in premature infants hospitalized in NICU compared to other infants (16,20).Family-centered developmental-supportive interventions, which relieve infant stress and pain, support infant self-regulation, and encourage further presence of parents at infants' bedside, cause an increase in bonding and attachment and positively affect different aspects of brain development (21,22).During the hospitalization of infants in NICU, familycentered interventions reduce maternal stress and AbstractObjectives: Premature birth and subsequent admission to the neonatal intensive care unit impair the mother-infant attachment process.The present study aimed to determine the impact of developmental care on the mother-child attachment at the adjusted age of 1 year.Materials and Methods: In a quasi-experimental study, 105 premature infants born in Al-Zahra hospital of Tabriz at a gestational age of 26 to 32 weeks and a weight of 1500 g or less were assigned to three groups of 35.The control group, intervention group 1, and 2 received routine care, developmental care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and neonatal unit, developmental care in the delivery room or operation room, respectively.The mother-child attachment at the adjusted age of 1 year was measured using Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale.Results: The mean (standard deviation) score of the mother-child attachment at the adjusted age of 1 year in the control group, intervention group 1 and 2 was determined to be 83.8 (6.9), 81.7 (5.7), and 81.4 (6.7), respectively.The results indicated no significant difference between the three groups in terms of the score of mother-child attachment and its subscales. Conclusion:In this study, high score of the mother-child attachment was observed in all three groups.Given the importance of developmental care and support to mothers of premature infants as well as the newness of developmental care in Iran, it seems necessary for authorities to pay more attention to this type of care and conduct further research on this subject.",

A significant factor in this increase is a change in the social expectation of fathers toward higher levels of involvement in their children's lives, together with a change in attitudes by separated and divorced fathers toward residence and contact, in a social context where mothers typically remain the primary parents. Central to many disputed cases of child custody are allegations of domestic violence, child abuse, and/or parental alienation. Fathers' rights groups claim that allegations of domestic violence and/or child abuse are false and are being used tactically to restrict contact. However, research indicates that false allegations of violence and abuse are rare and that minimization or false denials are more commonplace.",

Central to this nurturing environment is the responsivity of the primary caregiver, and provision of adequately sensitive social and emotional care is associated with many positive outcomes. However, flourishing, defined as emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing, appropriate physiological regulation, and a sociomoral orientation towards others, might require an intense level of caregiving on the part of the community that is atypical in the USA. Caregiving practices common among small-band hunter-gatherers, such as breastfeeding, copious positive touch, alloparenting and provision of opportunities for playful interactions, appear to be positively associated with sociomoral development, and may be necessary ingredients for flourishing in adulthood. Attention to these behaviors and the broad social context of early development might provide important steps toward creating proactively moral, prosocial communities.",

The French Family and Housing survey that was linked to the 2011 census is used to explore how multi-generational households are organised. The results confirm that this type of household continues to exist and should be considered other than a form of living arrangement that is destined to disappear. Approximately 8 % of individuals aged 30 years and above with a parent alive coreside with a parent, representing 1.8 million individuals. Overall, coresidence is associated more with men, individuals not in a couple, childlessness, unemployment or inactivity, crowded housing with poor amenities, and poor urban areas where the monthly income is below the average. Sharing a household can be considered as a family response to life course hazards. Three types of response can be identified. Adults living with their parents (38 %), who are more likely to be men with low resources, whereas women who have comfortable housing conditions are associated with living conditions where a parent is supported by an adult child (32 %). In the third group (30 %) the two generations are more likely to belong to higher social class sectors, although the available data cannot distinguish whether children accommodate their parents or parents accommodate their children.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the association between 'poor home conditions' or 'psychosocial adversity' and short stature by discussing briefly genetic influences on growth, then certain broad environmental variables, such as social class, which are known to differentiate children with retarded growth from those who are fulfilling their genetic potential. The correlation between parent and child heights increases during the first two years of the child's life, and then changes little until puberty. A very important observation has been made about the profile of the distribution of stature among the children of manual workers. Secular trends in stature might be expected to diminish the differences between the growth of children from upper and lower social classes. During infancy a reassortment of relative sizes among children comes about, those who are larger at birth tending to grow more slowly and those who are smaller often growing more quickly.",

      "abstract": "Self-concept is the basis for many cognitive and behavioural processes, such as the processing of self-related information (e.g., one’s own face, one’s own name) and the categorisation of people into various social groups (e.g. self vs other, family vs non-family). Previous research suggests that one’s self concept is not only construed from individual characteristics, but also from one’s social experiences and group memberships. Thus, important life experiences such as childbirth and becoming a parent have significant impacts on one’s self-concept, and subsequently influence the categorisation of information regarding the self and others. In two experiments, women who gave birth within the last 2 years were recruited and tested on a series of categorisation tasks using names (Experiment 1) or faces (Experiment 2) as stimuli. Results consistently revealed faster reaction times in response to the self regardless of stimulus type (name or face) and response category (self vs. other, family vs. non-family, familiar vs. non-familiar). A family bias for one’s own baby name and one’s own mother name over friend was observed in the family vs. non-family but not in the familiar vs. non-familiar categorisation tasks. These findings indicate that information regarding the self and one’s family members receives preferential processing in social categorisation. These findings contribute to current understandings of the evolving self-concept through social experiences, and its influence on group membership categorisations and response behaviour.",

In doing so, attention is given to the range of social, cultural, familial and economic conditions which frame young peoples’ lives, and which, for various periods of time, invite such persons to ‘get by’ or make sense of their existence through crime. The narratives of young men concerning their families, their neighbourhoods, and their perspectives on educational and other life-course opportunities denied or presented them, are used to pose a series of questions concerning who or what gets punished when persons are required to serve time in juvenile or adult custodial facilities. I conclude the article with the claim that confinement punishes not simply the offender. Rather, confinement (ineffectually and unjustly) interrupts successive (unlawful) attempts to negotiate the social and structural conditions of residents‘/prisoners’ life courses - conditions over which young people, in particular, often have little or no control.",

These relationships, though, can remain unexamined and individually negotiated until they are highlighted by major policy change. Such a change has recently occured in Scotland, where the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 has extended Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) to children and introduced Parenting Orders (POs), which can require parents to attend counselling or guidance sessions. ASBOs shift state intervention from focusing on children’s welfare and needs to focusing on their behaviour. The welfare-based children’s hearing system will no longer be the primary decision-making forum as the court is the decision-maker for both these new orders. POs emphasize parents’ responsibility for controlling their children. POs provide a direct route for parents to receive support, which they did not have before, but only through a compulsory order. Both children and their parents will be held responsible to their communities’ values, in new court-enforced mechanisms.",

Family types in a poor, black urban community were defined in terms of the adults present at home. The resulting taxonomy is based on two populations: half of the community's 1964 first-grade children and families and the entire 1966 first-grade children and families. Eighty-six family types were found, falling into ten major classes. Family type was found to be strongly related over time to the child's social adaptational status (SAS) and his or her psychological wellbeing. The results suggest that (1) mother alone families entail the highest risk in terms of social maladaptation and psychological well-being of the child; (2) the presence of certain second adults has important ameliorative functions—mother/grandmother families being nearly as effective as mother/father families, with mother/stepfather families similar to mother alone in regard to risk; and (3) the absence of the father was less important than the aloneness of the mother in relation to risk.",

Drawing from a larger sample of fathers without contact, the responses of 14 fathers who do not wish to see their children are compared with those who would like contact. It was found that the fathers who do not want contact are more apt to have been in a violent marital relationship, to have bcen less involved with the childrearing of their children, and to feel indifferent about their children. It is hypothesized that these fathers may interpret harassment or ambivalence towards them as rejection rather than as a potential outgrowth of a divorce situation.

As a child grows, she experiences many different kinds of incentives toward socialization and integration into society. As with socialization, the demands of individuation and differentiation begin early and continue throughout life. In some ways, socialization and individuation are quite distinct processes, even at times operating in opposition to one another. Yet there is a sense in which there are profound connections between socialization and individuation. The puzzle of socialization is how an active child comes to adopt behavioral standards consistent with the values embedded in the child's culture. Rather, socialization is a complex process of interaction between the child and others in the child's social network.",

      "abstract": "During recent decades, there have been far-reaching social changes in Western countries, that have affected parent-teacher relationships dramatically. The worldwide Covid19 crisis has exacerbated educational gaps, especially among disadvantaged populations. Therefore, restoring parent-teacher relationships is a key factor in reducing inequality. However, many models of parent-teacher communication have not yet been updated to include multicultural approach or socio-systemic work. Accordingly, we propose a new integrative applicable model: safe educational partnership with parents. This model is based on cultivating psychological safety, including identity safety, as a necessary condition for building close relations. For this purpose, the teacher has to work in three levels: 1) intra-personal level 2) inter-personal level and 3) institutional-organizational level. Educators and counselors can use this model to lead protected empathetic interactions with parents and promote an environment with a perspective of \"value in diversity\", for the benefit of restoring trusting relationships with parents and reducing gaps.",

      "abstract": "Research Findings: Siblings' interactions in early childhood may provide a unique context for understanding others' needs and fostering prosociality. This 2-year longitudinal study examined children's prosocial responsiveness to their siblings' needs during naturalistic interactions. European-Canadian sibling dyads (N = 39) were observed in their homes for a total of 18 hours – when they were age 2 and 4 years and 2 years later. Prosocial opportunities were identified from children's manifestations of need and coded for types of responses to such needs. Analyses indicated that younger siblings manifested more cues indicating a need. Siblings often expressed their needs explicitly through direct verbal or nonverbal requests. Alongside situational cues and parental intervention, direct verbal requests were particularly likely to elicit prosociality. Children engaged in helping more than sharing, followed by comforting and protecting. Opportunities to share were rejected more than other types of prosocial behaviors. With age, children were more likely to help, and less likely to refuse to share. With regards to birth order, 4-year-old firstborns engaged in helping, comforting, and protecting (but not sharing) more than 4-year-old secondborns. Practice or Policy: Findings have implications for parents by suggesting ways in which prosociality can be fostered within the sibling relationship in early childhood, and for researchers by extending recent theories of early prosociality from experimental settings to naturalistic interactions.",

      "title": "Mothers’ Generalized Beliefs About Adolescents:",
      "abstract": "Mothers’ generalized beliefs about adolescents were used to predict a mother’s expectations for her own child’s adolescent years. Participants were 75 mothers of children in either sixth grade or seventh grade. Generalized beliefs about adolescents predicted the mother’s expectations for her own young adolescent even after accounting for the young adolescent’s current attributes (e.g., depressed mood, closeness to mother). For example, the more likely a mother was to believe that adolescents as a group are conforming, risk-taking and rebellious, or internalizing, the more likely she was to expect adolescence to be difficult for her own child. Greater beliefs that adolescents are upstanding/prosocial predicted greater expectations for a closer parent/child relationship during the child’s adolescence. The link between a mother’s generalized beliefs and her expectations for her young adolescent did not vary by the child’s pubertal development or gender. Potential implications of parental beliefs concerning adolescence for parenting and parent/child relationships are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In the lives of teachers wishing to express their child-centred pedagogy, consent in education started perhaps with their sense of vocation for the profession and their own educational theory. Levels of consent unawareness extend of course among young people into their personal lives. In every aspect of young people's lives consent features: work, sexuality, family, friends, community. Given that most children attend school to get an education to fit them for society, there are interesting concerns in many of these settings with consent (or lack of it) around their appearance. While considering this does not take account of issues of control, uniformity of image and branding, compliance, fascism, behavioural regulation, the hidden curriculum and so on, the matter of school rules about what to wear is a classic example of lack of consent in education. At the heart of education lies a lot of silence about consent.",

The meaning and significance of grandparenthood often derive from societal and familial contexts that are beyond grandparents’ own control. On the societal level, the prevalence and duration of grandparenthood as well as the normative underpinnings of the grandparent role reflect cultural and demographic change. On the familial level, grandparents’ functions within the family context are often shaped by special needs of the children or grandchildren rather than by grandparents’ own aspirations. On the personal level, individuals experience the transition to grandparenthood as a countertransition, contingent on the fertility decisions of their children, and access to grandchildren is often mediated by the parent generation.",

The analysis found that family members behaved differently in a conflict within a generation and across generations. In both intra- and intergenerational relationships, conflicts were more likely to escalate when both parties possessed competitive and/or avoidance conflict handling styles and showed unregulated emotions (aggressive and passive-aggressive behaviors). The results also show that senior family members tended to reciprocate juniors’ aggressive and assertive-persuasive behavior in intergenerational conflicts. Junior members tended to respond to seniors’ aggressive behavior reciprocally or complementary. Meanwhile, family members were most likely to reciprocate the other party’s conflict behavior in intra-generational conflicts.",

      "abstract": "The shift toward providing technologically complex care at home implies an assumption that \"being home is good\" – that this is the most desirable option. The aim of this study was to conduct an empirical analysis of the moral experience of families with children requiring assisted home ventilation. Twelve families (39 family members) were recruited through the Quebec Program for Home Ventilatory Assistance. Family moral experiences were investigated using a semi-structured interview and fieldwork observations. Six principal thematic categories were identified in the empirical data. (1) Confronting Parental Responsibility – Struggling to be a \"good\" parent: efforts necessary for families to balance one child's life-sustaining needs with everyday family needs. (2) Seeking Normality: striving to reconstruct family life into as normal a reality as possible. (3) Conflicting Social Values: a sense of devaluation of life with disability. (4) Living in Isolation: experience of marginalization resulting from conflicting social values. (5) What about the Voice of the Child? (the disclosures and silences of patients and their siblings); (6) Questioning the Moral Order: seeking to find sense in life. An overarching phenomenon that best characterizes these families' experiences was identified: daily living with distress and enrichment, highlighting that these children were not simply family burdens but also important sources of pleasure. These findings call for an increased sensitization to the needs of this population among staff in critical care, acute, and community settings.",

Using a non-probability purposive sample (N = 55), this study explores whether or not caregiver well being is effected by the type of kinship care arrangement (formal vs. informal). The findings suggest that grandparents in formal kinship care arrangements experienced feelings of depression less often, were more satisfied with their parenting experiences and were observed to have a greater sense of satisfaction with life.

      "title": "Parents' care and career: comparing parental leave policies",
      "abstract": "The presence of young children in the household makes it necessary for working parents to find ways in which to combine professional responsibilities and care tasks. The externalisation of household chores to the market frees time for parents to spend on their caring duties. Furthermore, public childcare allows for a further externalisation of care tasks and as such is supportive of working parents, because it also secures time for both parents. As stated in chapter 2, a childcare system that meets several conditions (universal access, all-day coverage, high quality and affordability) facilitates an adequate division by parents of their time between childcare and work. However, given the high public cost of an affordable and universally accessible childcare system for children under 6 years of age, some countries have found an alternative in a parental leave system. The state's involvement in parental leave schemes may also be related to the way a country conceives children's early socialisation: through private external care, through public facilities or through parental care (Martin 2003). In many countries, parents are expected to be the primary caregivers when the child is very young (Math and Meilland 2004). Be that as it may, if home parental care is privileged in a given country, it does not necessarily mean that the state intervenes in the family sphere to secure parents' work resumption or substantial replacement of income.",

      "abstract": "Familismo (valuing family over individual needs including aging adult care) is often theoretically central to research about family caregivers of aging adults of Mexican descent and other allocentric cultures. Familismo has been shown to have strong protective outcomes, yet act as a barrier to use of supportive care, such as home health care services (HHCS). Acculturation (an individual’s acceptance of dominant viewpoints, operationalized as “Anglo” or “Mexican” “orientation”) varies in its associations with variables; e.g., Familismo. We explored family caregivers’ associations among Familismo and Acculturation with Caregiving Burden, Knowledge of HHCS, and Confidence in HHCS, as part of a randomized control trial to increase Mexican-descent aging adults’ use of HHCS. Some results were in the expected direction; e.g., Familismo positively associated with Mexican orientation (r=.328) and negatively with burden (r= -.294); Knowledge of HHCS associated with Anglo orientation (r=.252). However, Fear of HHCS, a subscale of Confidence (reverse coding), negatively associated with Mexican orientation (r= -.304); results varied by spouse/other and offspring caregivers. Spouse/other caregivers’ Fear positively associated with English Language Preference subscale (r=.383); Offspring caregivers’ Fear negatively associated with Spanish Language Preference subscale (r= -.404). Perhaps older, English-speaking caregivers had had more negative experiences with the healthcare system increasing fear; perhaps younger, non-English-speaking caregivers had been assigned more bilingual, culturally competent providers, decreasing fear. Researchers, clinicians, and policymakers should standardize measures of Familismo and Acculturation, and address the complexity of differential cultural needs when designing interventions to improve families’ access to services in the US and globally.",

Social support from friends, family members, neighbors, and healthcare professionals can potentially prevent or mitigate caregiver strain. However, little is known about how social support experiences differ among caregivers at different life course stages. This study uses thematic analysis of data from in-depth interviews with 50 caregivers of patients enrolled in hospice services to compare experiences mobilizing social support among caregivers at two life course stages: midlife caregivers caring for parents and older adult caregivers caring for spouses/partners. Both groups experienced long-term relationships and close social network ties as facilitators of support. For older adult caregivers, physical proximity to sources of social support also facilitated support mobilization. Older adult caregivers identified barriers to accepting social support as including: a preference to autonomously adhere to personal habits and routines, a sense of obligation to fulfill their role as spouses, and a perception that potential sources of support had their own families or other patients to take care of. Midlife caregivers’ barriers to accepting social support included domestic conflict arising from multiple, overlapping caregiving roles, and disagreements among multiple siblings providing care for one parent. Findings enhance the understanding of how caregivers’ life course stage affects their mobilization of social support resources.",

      "abstract": "A central issue is how to provide both prevention and treatment interventions designed to bolster resilience and build on existing and potential strengths in diverse, victimized, and high-risk groups of children, youth, families, and communities. Children and youth frequently experience different types of victimization on multiple occasions, rather than being exposed to singular experiences. There is an overlap of different types of victimization experiences, such as living in high-risk crime-saturated poverty areas, witnessing violence at home, or experiencing neglect and abuse. Resilience is not a trait that a child is born with or automatically keeps once it is achieved. Resilience is a complex interactive process that entails characteristics of the child, the family, extra-familial relationships, and school and community factors. Protective factors differ across gender, race, and culture. For instance, girls tend to bolster their resilience by building strong, caring relationships, while boys are more likely to build resilience by learning active problem-solving.",

Group day care homes spent more time in structured activity and had more large group contact than centers. Children in centers spent more time in transition and solitary play. There were several differences between centers and day homes within behavior settings. During structured periods, adult‐child interaction and social participation was of higher quality in day care homes. The adult‐child interaction in both types of child care tended to be neutral in affective tone.",

      "title": "Patterns of Grandparents Caring for Grandchildren in China",
      "abstract": "Increased life expectancy and reduced child mortality in most countries around the world indicate that more and more people now live to be grandparents and experience an extended period of grandparenthood. Becoming a grandparent is associated with many important changes in relationships, life styles, and activities (Crosnoe and Elder 2002; Elder 1994; King et al. 1998; Uhlenberg and Kirby 1998). In many societies, grandparents provide care and assistance to their grandchildren. These levels of care range from occasional helping to full-time custodial care. At the micro level, the amount of grandparent caregiving is often driven by the needs of the parents. Examples include weekend babysitting to allow adult children some relief from parenting, or surrogate parenting as a response to a crisis situation in which the parents are unable to fulfill their parental responsibilities. At the macro level, social norms and structural contexts influence the extent of grandparent caregiving in different settings. For example, in the United States, most grandparents do not provide routine care for grandchildren, conforming to a norm of noninterference in intergenerational relationships (Cherlin and Furstenberg 1986). In an East Asian country such as China, where Confucian heritage prescribes strong ties between parents and their children throughout life, it is normative for grandparents to provide care on a consistent basis for their grandchildren (Chen et al. 2000; Hermalin et al. 1998; Unger 1993).",

The substitute families are more often large with number of children from 3 to 8 and quarter of them are incomplete. The mean age of substitute parent consists 47.8±1.4 years. The leading motivation to take orphan child for education in family is the availability of kindred relationship regarding child or “deserted nest syndrome”. At the initial phase of establishing of substitute family the most of substitute parents/tutors face with problems of health status and behavioral deviations of foster children. The substitute parents are unsatisfied with quality of medical monitoring of foster children. They also suffer from deficiency of information concerning characteristics of development, health conditions and modes of rehabilitation of children. In the judgment of substitute parents/ tutors placing child into family conditions effects positively on one's development and health, behavior and emotional background. In substitute families, conditions organized for children can be named as approximated to conditions of residing in biological (home) families. The system of medical psychological and pedagogical monitoring of children of this category is needed in further development.",

      "abstract": "The costs of teenage parenthood may not be limited to the mothers themselves but may extend to their children as well. Children might be affected in a variety of ways. Adolescent mothers may not have much time to spend with their children due to the competing demands of school or work; they may need to piece together complex childrearing arrangements; they may not be the most competent of parents because of social immaturity or inadequate knowledge about childrearing; and of course, they are likely to be economically disadvantaged. Such conditions are believed to place the children of teenage parents at risk of developmental delays, social and emotional problems, school dropout, and early childbearing, thus helping to perpetuate a cycle of disadvantage. On the basis of rather little evidence, the supposition that disadvantage is transmitted intergenerationally in families with teenage parents seems plausible if not compelling. Recall the quotation cited in Chapter 1, which referred to the rising rates of teenage childbearing as revealing “a terrible story … children having children, passing on depression and helplessness from generation to generation.”",

The adolescent mothers were interviewed in a semi-structured format during their pregnancy, at the loss of the pregnancy or neonate, and two, four, six, and twelve months after the death of the infant. Bereaved adolescent mothers experienced extreme fluctuations in emotions following their loss. Additionally, they experienced losses associated with development and their successful transition to adulthood: identity losses, separation from family of origin losses, and friendship losses. No bereavement support or educational programs currently exist for bereaved adolescent mothers; they thus face potential deleterious impacts on their physiological, interpersonal, familial, and social well-being.",

Most of this research has examined topic avoidance in couples, parent–child relationships, and family caregiving contexts, with emerging focus on siblings and broader family systems. Family members are motivated to avoid difficult or potentially conflict‐inducing topics related to health, such as distressing emotions, death and dying, and identity‐threatening issues like body image and past risky behavior. Family members report avoiding topics in order to accomplish numerous goals, such as protecting one another from distressing emotions and respecting one another's privacy. Some health topics are avoided by families because of their complex and uncertain nature, which leaves families feeling unable to discuss them adequately. Although many people perceive benefits from avoiding tough conversations about health with family members, there is also evidence that avoidance is associated with lower relationship satisfaction and mental well‐being.",

The sick person inevitably declines or loses ability in role performances. Therefore, when the family has the sick, the role structure of family might change. That is, the family members except the sick, if they want to keep their family functions in the same way, must partly or totally undertake the duties of the sick person.Whether or not this subrogation goes smoothly and the family functions are maintained as usual seems to be determined by the following factors : the degree of the sickness and status (husband, wife or child) of the sick ; family size and stage of family life cycle ; class ; relationship with relatives, neighbors and occupational groups ; and existing state of the national welfare system.The authors examined twenty four conjugal families and categorized them into following three groups : the change of role structure no dysfunction…(A) dysfunction → reversion to former functions…(B) dysfunction → permanent dysfunction…(C) In this study, 11 (A) cases, 2 (B) cases, 11 (C) cases were found. Regarding the (C) group, the physical condition of the sick was not only extremely bad but also the family was small and on an early stage of the family life cycle. Moreover, the family was of the lower class and did not associate frequently with the outer groups such as mentioned above. Therefore these (C) group families could not have good success in the role re-distributions to keep the family functions, and they could only make a bare living with livelihood assistance under the Livelihood Protection Law. The authors recommend that the process of the change of the family role structure should be considered in order to make clear the health problems faced by the contemporary families.",

      "abstract": "Family (biological or otherwise) is central to everyone’s life. As a primary and natural socializing microenvironment, it is of great importance for the birth of a person’s personality and full development of his potential, i.e. – physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioral development. Often, the key to understanding childhood problems lies in the analysis and assessment of the family situation, since the child’s mental development is determined not only by his individual characteristics, but also by the characteristics of communication in the family system to which he belongs. In the considered context, the concept of quality means understanding and fulfilling the expectations of the client (the family, with low parental capacity), the user of the psychological intervention. Quality is a set of all signs and characteristics of psychological work with parents with low parental capacity. They determine the reliability of the chosen psychological intervention to respond to and even build on awareness of the needs and demands of the client (the parenting system). The quality of psychological support determines the expected and desired parameters of the outcome of the process of psychoconsultative interaction in the relationship “psychologist-consultant - parents with low parental capacity”.",

This phenomenon is also referred to as in the middle or in the middle. The concept of sandwich generation in a narrow sense refers mainly to the traditionally perceived caring roles of women who are middle-aged (middle adulthood) and at the same time on the forefront of old age (before late adulthood). In the feminist approach, the social expectations towards women between 40 and 60 years old are oriented on helping children and young people to get an independent adult life, on the other hand they are oriented towards providing care to the older generation, especially in the case of disability, dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Expectations regarding these care roles are formalized in a smaller one (eg tradition, gender equality, cultural circle, stereotypes) or to a greater extent (eg family policy of the state, personnel policy of enterprises, universality of work-life balance programs) which leads to inequality between women and men (Korzec, 1997).\r\n\r\nPolish abstract: Generacja - grupa osob w wieku średnim, ktora ze wzgledu na swoją centralną pozycje (status) w strukturze wieku i w związanej z nią stratyfikacji wiekowej stanowi generacje (pokolenie), ktore jednocześnie opiekuje sie osobami starszymi (przewaznie swoimi rodzicami) i osobami mlodszymi (przewaznie swoimi dziecmi). Zjawisko to określane jest tez jako kobiety w środku (ang. women in the middle) lub zlapani w środku (ang. being caught in the middle). Koncepcja generacji sandwicz (pokolenia kanapki) w wąskim ujeciu odnoszona jest przewaznie do tradycyjnie postrzeganych rol opiekunczych kobiet, ktore są w wieku środkowym (środkowej doroslości), a zarazem na przedpolu starości (przed poźną doroslością). W ujeciu feministycznym spoleczne oczekiwania wobec kobiet znajdujących sie miedzy 40. a 60. rokiem zycia są zorientowane z jednej strony na udzielanie pomocy dzieciom i mlodziezy w uzyskaniu samodzielnego doroslego zycia, z drugiej zaś są ukierunkowane na udzielanie pomocy pielegnacyjnej starszemu pokoleniu szczegolnie w przypadku niepelnosprawności, otepienia lub choroby Alzheimera. Oczekiwania wobec powyzszych rol opiekunczych są sformalizowane w mniejszym (np. tradycja, rownośc plci, krąg kulturowy, stereotypy) lub wiekszym stopniu (np. polityka rodzinna panstwa, polityka kadrowa przedsiebiorstw, powszechnośc programow rownowagi praca-zycie) co prowadzi do nierowności miedzy kobietami i mezczyznami (Korzec, 1997).",

      "abstract": "Emerging data suggest that during childhood, close family relationships can ameliorate the impact that adversity has on life span physical health. To explain this phenomenon, a developmental stress buffering model is proposed in which characteristics of family relationships including support, conflict, obligation, and parenting behaviors evolve and change from childhood to adolescence. Together, these characteristics govern whether childhood family relationships are on balance positive enough to fill a moderating role in which they mitigate the effects that childhood adversities have on physical health. The benefits of some family relationship characteristics are hypothesized to stay the same across childhood and adolescence (e.g., the importance of comfort and warmth from family relationships) whereas the benefits of other characteristics are hypothesized to change from childhood to adolescence (e.g., from a need for physical proximity to parents in early childhood to a need for parental availability in adolescence). In turn, close, positive family relationships in childhood operate via a variety of pathways, such as by reducing the impact that childhood stressors have on biological processes (e.g., inflammation) and on health behaviors that in turn can shape physical health over a lifetime.

      "title": "Parents' care and career: comparing parental leave policies",
      "abstract": "Introduction The presence of young children in the household makes it necessary for working parents to find ways in which to combine professional responsibilities and care tasks. The externalisation of household chores to the market frees time for parents to spend on their caring duties. Furthermore, public childcare allows for a further externalisation of care tasks and as such is supportive of working parents, because it also secures time for both parents. As stated in chapter 2, a childcare system that meets several conditions (universal access, all-day coverage, high quality and affordability) facilitates an adequate division by parents of their time between childcare and work. However, given the high public cost of an affordable and universally accessible childcare system for children under 6 years of age, some countries have found an alternative in a parental leave system. The state's involvement in parental leave schemes may also be related to the way a country conceives children's early socialisation: through private external care, through public facilities or through parental care (Martin 2003). In many countries, parents are expected to be the primary caregivers when the child is very young (Math and Meilland 2004). Be that as it may, if home parental care is privileged in a given country, it does not necessarily mean that the state intervenes in the family sphere to secure parents' work resumption or substantial replacement of income.",

Through a two-fold approach to removing medical intervention in biological reproduction and advocating for non-biological parenting, sustainability can be prioritized. Before this can occur, recognition of the deeply embedded social and psychological reasons for reproduction must be addressed. Both as social capital and as a palliative to anxiety over individual mortality, reproduction must be assessed frankly. Public health and other social policies may attempt to build awareness of infertility, attempt measures to prevent infertility, and support acceptance of infertility. There are many ways that adults can parent without procreation, including adoption, fostering, and co-parenting, as well as mentoring, spiritual parenting, caring for step-children, and teaching. Larger social structures that support childwishes will need to be created and maintained. These include work policies that either disincentivize reproduction or incentivize parenting without procreation.",

      "abstract": "A method for classifying family interaction behavior is presented that underlies several related studies of variation in families' modes of interpreting and interacting with the social environment. Evidence is presented for the existence of three dimensions of family problem‐solving behavior that: (a) are consistent with theory of variation in families' orientations to the environment; (b) are useful for interpreting differences within nonclinical as well as clinical samples of families; and (c) have been shown, within current samples' ranges, to be essentially independent of surface markers of family variation and accumulated skills of family members.",

      "title": "Adults before their time : parentification during adolescence in divorcing and married families",
      "abstract": "In broad terms, parentification can be defined as a child taking on the role of parent to his or her own parents; though in reality the construct is more complex. Although related constructs (e.g. boundary transgressions, role reversal, ‘hurried child’) have been discussed in the literature for many years, the term ‘parentification’ per se is a relatively new one within the field of psychological research and empirical studies are still limited. When researching in the field of parentification, an issue that is apparent is the lack of adequate measures of parentification available for children and adolescents. The few measures of parentification that exist have been (a) retrospective (asking adults to recall levels of responsibility within their families of origin as adolescents) and/or (b) uni-dimensional (measuring parentification as a single score rather than taking into account different facets such as confidant to one’s own parents, mediator between conflicting parents, ‘pseudo-parents’ to siblings, or excessive household responsibilities). The first aim of the current research was to develop a reliable and valid multidimensional measure of parentification that was appropriate for completion by children and adolescents. The series of studies that follow utilise this newly developed parentification scale to examine parentification of adolescents aged 10-16 years from families undergoing parental divorce. A comparison group of children from two-parent continuously married (not remarried) families were included. A previously validated uni-dimensional measure of parentification, the Parentification Questionnaire – Youth (PQ-Y: Godsall & Jurkovic, 1995) was also used throughout the studies (although in the current sample, this measure was multidimensional, yielding two factors labelled Alienation and Tangible Tasks). Broad research goals of the studies are: 1. to examine parentification (and its association with family functioning and sibling relationship quality) from the perspective of multiple family members, 2. to explore parentification differences between families on variables of age, sex, birth order, family size and parental marital status, and 3. to assess the extent to which parentification affects adolescent psychological adjustment, and how burden of parentification may mediate the relationship between parentification and psychological adjustment. Parents and children aged 10-16 years from 304 families (127 divorcing; 177 married) were invited to participate in a 12-month study of parentification that included questions about demographics, family responsibilities, family functioning, adolescent adjustment, and sibling relationships. In addition, in divorcing families, both parents and one child (target child) were invited to be interviewed regarding their experiences surrounding the separation and divorce. The measure of parentification designed for the current research adapted the multidimensional, retrospective measure written by Mika, Bergner and Baum (1987). This new measure was labelled the Youth Parentification Scale (YPS), and findings suggest that it is a reliable measure of parentification in the current sample of married and divorcing families. Results revealed that children from divorcing families and girls reported higher levels of parentification (across various factors). Results on multiple perspectives within the family were mixed. In general, children were more likely than their parents to report higher levels of parentification within the family, although this effect differed slightly dependent upon parental marital status. Siblings who reported offering support to other members of the family also rated their relationship with their sibling as warmer: this result held true for both firstand second-born children. Additionally, both first- and second-born children agreed that parentification may affect the relative status/power between siblings. While few direct associations between parentification and adjustment existed, negative adjustment outcomes (higher anxiety, higher depression and lower self-esteem) were evident when the burden associated with increased responsibility was taken into account. Taking on the role of confidant to one’s parents, playing ‘pseudo-parent’ to one’s siblings, or feeling alienated within one’s family of origin was associated with higher levels of burden, which in turn led children to report higher depression and anxiety and lower self-esteem. Additionally, taking on a parentified role was associated with higher levels of burden, which in turn was associated with reports of lower levels of family functioning (i.e. lower intimacy, higher conflict, and a more controlling parenting style). The current research has implications for the development and refinement of future measures of parentification for use in empirical studies. The Youth Parentification Scale showed that different facets of parentification do seem to exist, and that offering comfort and support to mothers or fathers seems to have an association with various aspects of adjustment, sibling relationships and general family functioning. Alienation (a factor emerging from the PQ-Y), while not actually associated with increased responsibility or parentification per se, showed associations with parentification that indicate that this may be an important construct to include in future attempts at developing a comprehensive measure of parentification. Additionally, the current research unveiled findings that may have clinical importance. Findings revealed that while children from divorcing families did exhibit higher scores on various scales of parentification, outcomes were not necessarily worse for these children than for children within married families who were similarly parentified. Adolescence is a time of emotional growth when some age-appropriate adoption of adult responsibility is warranted; and in fact for children undergoing the transition of parental separation and divorce, adoption of extra responsibilities may be adaptive, perhaps even protective inasmuch as it may bring the child closer to parents during a time when anxiety about family dissolution is high. Further studies (preferably longitudinal) exploring the adaptive facets of parentification are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Parents and their adolescent children tend to disagree about children’s responsibilities in the family, particularly when it comes to caring for parents and household chores. We explored whether this disagreement is similar in three ethnic groups or whether it depends on ethnic background and acculturation. More particularly we investigated: (a) how adolescents and parents perceive family obligations and to what extent their perceptions differ, (b) to what extent family obligations are shaped by ethnic background and acculturation experiences, and (c) to what extent intergenerational discrepancies in family obligations are linked to adolescents’ well-being (i.e., self-esteem, life satisfaction, psychological problems, and behavioral problems). Seventy-four Surinamese, 115 Turkish, and 92 national adolescent-parent dyads living in the Netherlands completed a survey on adolescents’ family obligations. Across ethnic groups, parents reported more family obligations than their children. Turkish and Surinamese families reported more family obligations than did national families. Secondly, intergenerational discrepancies in family obligations were related to ethnicity and acculturation. Finally, larger intergenerational discrepancies coincided with lower life satisfaction and more behavioral problems. In short, intergenerational discrepancies in family obligations may be a common phenomenon, but this phenomenon also depends on families’ ethnic background and acculturation experiences.",

      "abstract": "Plusieurs hypotheses concernant la signification fonctionnelle du jeu existent : un indicateur de bien etre, un sous-produit de la domestication, un entrainement moteur ou social pour la vie adulte ou pour ameliorer la reaction de l’individu a l’inattendu, voir un outil permettant la cohesion sociale. Cette etude avait pour but de tester ces differentes hypotheses en nous basant sur nos travaux sur les chevaux et les primates. Nous avons compare la frequence des jeux chez les adultes vivant dans des environnements differents (milieu naturel, semi-naturel, milieu appauvri), d’origines differentes (nes en captivite ou d’origine sauvage) ou vivant en groupes sociaux stable ou instable. Nous avons egalement recherche des correlations entre l’expression du jeu et des variables traduisant un etat de bien-etre et/ou de stress. Les especes domestiques presentent un taux de jeux similaire a celui des especes sauvages. Ceci invalide l’hypothese d’un sous-produit de la domestication. Les animaux vivant dans des environnements semi-naturels (sans predateur et sans restriction alimentaire) jouent autant que des animaux sauvages. L’absence de contraintes n’est donc pas un element determinant dans l’expression du jeu. Un lien entre instabilite sociale du groupe et occurrence du jeu a ete mis en evidence, l’instabilite engendrant d’avantage de jeu. Enfin des correlations positives ont ete trouvees entre occurrence du jeu chez l’adulte et variables de mal-etre (stereotypies…) et/ou de stress. Ainsi, le jeu apparait comme une solution permettant de reduire le stress et une meilleure adaptation a de mauvaises conditions de vie.",

Early behaviors taken as evidence of an innate desire to connect with others generally include eye contact, smiles, and positive vocalizations. Studies have shown that, as infants mature, they begin to alternate gaze between objects of interest and their social partners (joint attention), and show signs that some people are special to them by becoming distressed when separated from them (attachment). In this article, we seek to highlight less frequently studied ways that infants and young children show their desire to connect and communicate with others. To do so, we draw on studies of infants in underrepresented communities, interviews with parents of autistic children, and a recent study of interactions between autistic adults.",

When choosing a form of placement for children, several factors should be considered: the advantages and disadvantages of a particular placement, estimated length of separation from the family, specific treatment and other needs of the child. Children's homes are a specific environmental context, where children live together 24 hours a day and perform daily activities, and their educational group largely replaces socialization and practical functions of the family. Institutionalized children are children who spend a period longer than three months in an institution, in a group of more than ten children and are included in the daily routines and structure of the institution. They are formally stigmatized just by being placed in an institution.",

      "abstract": "During the corona virus pandemic, the lives of citizens and their activities took place in complex conditions, and due to the state of emergency, children and adolescents found it difficult to endure social isolation. In such circumstances, where movement is restricted due to curfew, young people were forced to spend most of their time at home, isolated and deprived of their usual daily activities and contacts. In such circumstances, where they are limited with movement and communication only with close family members, certain frustrations often occur, which are the result of loneliness and isolation. Of course, all this leaves a mark on their behavior, which is often inappropriate and indicates some of the behavioral disorders such as aggression, withdrawal, timidity, depression, etc. This situ- ation in the society caused by the pandemic will certainly leave certain consequences on behavior, and in general on the development and formation of personality, children and adolescents, mostly due to a kind of social exclusion imposed on us and which we could not influence in time. The aim of this paper is to identify the most common forms of socially maladaptive behavior in adolescents, caused by the coronary virus pandemic, and to indi- cate the importance of an adequate pedagogical and psychological approach in this popu- lation in emergency circumstances.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to study manifestations of uncomfortable familial commitments. The connection of such commitments to informal family carers' descriptions of problems in accessibility of services and to descriptions of preferences regarding limited use of formal help is examined. The data consists of 21 qualitative interviews of Finnish persons who, alongside their gainful employment, cared for their parent(s). It is argued that the lives of adult children and parent(s) needing care and help are interdependent, and various uncomfortable familial commitments exist due to problems in service provision (accessibility of services) or the reluctance of parents to accept formal help (use of services). These commitments are manifested in a lack of personal time. Furthermore, lack of personal time can be manifested in a lack of physical time. However, it can also be manifested in a lack of 'happy-go-lucky time' (time without continuous concern) or 'autonomous' time. Social care services enable working carers to have respite from the otherwise continuous concern and worry about the well-being of parent(s). However, receiving formal help is contextualized both with structural rationales and individual and familial rationales. Consequently, policies improving the possibilities of combining work and care solely by service accessibility might not be helpful for those carers who face the reluctance of their parent(s) to accept services.",

Individuals who have spouses, partners, children, or less time‐flexible occupations are expected to be less willing and likely to participate in collective action because familial and occupational commitments can reduce the amount of time and energy available for activism and increase the risks associated with it. Theoretically, biographical availability should be more significant in cases of costly or risky social activism, with costs referring to the time, money, and energy requirements of participation and risk referring to the anticipated dangers of participation, such as physical harm or social, financial, and legal repercussions. For example, while signing petitions does not involve significant time away from work or children, participating in protest events does, and because this activity could result in arrest, there is potentially an additional risk for those who are employed or who are primary caregivers of children.",

      "title": "Salud mental, sobrecarga, calidad de vida y utilización de servicios de salud, en cuidadores familiares de solicitantes de la Ley de promoción de la autonomía personal y atención a personas en situación de dependencia",
      "abstract": "Nuestra sociedad se encuentra inmersa en la adaptacion a un nuevo marco derivado de condicionantes socio-demograficos, epidemiologicos y culturales, que han determinado un aumento progresivo de la necesidad de cuidados a personas en su domicilio. El envejecimiento es en gran medida responsable de una mayor dependencia y necesidad de cuidados en nuestra era. La composicion y funcionalidad de las familias, asi como la influencia del genero en la funcion familiar, constituyen elementos cruciales en la necesidad de cuidados domiciliarios, la mayoria de ellos dispensados por no profesionales. En la asignacion de los roles de cuidados entre los miembros de las familias se presenta un claro sesgo de genero, que tiene su origen en valores arraigados culturalmente. El proceso de conversion del familiar en cuidador o cuidadora es progresivo, puede durar anos, va minando la salud fisica (espacios poco adecuados para el cuidado, movilizaciones sin ayuda…) y psicologica (carga mental plena de incertidumbre, ansiedad, inseguridad, responsabilidad…etc) de quien ejerce este papel y ocasiona con frecuencia empobrecimiento social (perdida de relaciones sociales, dificultad para continuar o iniciar actividades laborales, impacto en las relaciones con el resto de miembros de la familia) y una irrevocable merma en la calidad de vida. En Espana la Ley 39/2006 del 14 de diciembre, de Promocion de la Autonomia Personal y Atencion a las Personas en Situacion de Dependencia, creo un nuevo derecho subjetivo de ciudadania en el Estado espanol: el derecho de las personas que no pueden valerse por si mismas a recibir la atencion necesaria por parte de los poderes publicos . Este estudio pretende conocer en primer termino cual es el perfil de las personas cuidadoras familiares de dependientes moderados y severos que solicitan ayudas a traves de la Ley de Promocion de la Autonomia Personal y Atencion a las Personas en Situacion de Dependencia en Andalucia y en segundo termino pretende conocer como evoluciona la salud mental, la sobrecarga, la calidad de vida y la utilizacion de servicios de salud en estas personas cuidadoras familiares que esperan recibir ayudas para la dependencia. Objetivo Analizar la salud mental, sobrecarga, calidad de vida y utilizacion de servicios de salud de los cuidadores familiares de personas dependientes que solicitan ayudas de la Ley de Promocion de la Autonomia Personal y Atencion a las Personas en Situacion de Dependencia en Andalucia. Metodo Estudio analitico longitudinal multicentrico de seguimiento de una cohorte de 448 personas cuidadoras familiares. Resultados Nuestro estudio revela que el 78,6% de las personas cuidadoras son mujeres, de edad media 57,25 anos, llevan de media 2,45 anos cuidando a su familiar dependiente, el 80% de la muestra dedica mas de 9 horas diarias al cuidado y son mas del 58% los que dedican mas de 20 horas diaria, tienen principalmente estudios primarios, ademas del trabajo de cuidar, la ocupacion principal es ser ama de casa. Las cuidadoras padecen signos de depresion (48%), ansiedad (63%), y una gran sobrecarga (58%) y esta se mantiene a lo largo del seguimiento. Padecer sobrecarga eleva 5,5 veces el riesgo de sufrir ansiedad, tener depresion 4,8, ser mujer 2,4, tener una renta mensual por encima del salario minimo interprofesional 1,8, y por el contrario la cuidadora que tiene entre 31 y 50 anos, tiene el 34% menos de riesgo de padecer ansiedad que el resto de grupos etarios. sufrir ansiedad eleva 5,3 veces mas el riesgo de sufrir sobrecarga, la depresion 3,1, tener un nivel mas bajo de renta eleva el riesgo, estableciendose la mayor diferencia en la cuidadora sin ingresos que tiene 3,7 veces mas riesgo de padecer sobrecarga, por el contrario el bajo nivel de estudios se posiciona como marcador protector, la cuidadora analfabeta, sin estudios o con primarios tienen un 20% menos de riesgo de sufrir sobrecarga que las que tienen estudios secundarios o universitarias. La cuidadora de un familiar con deterioro cognitivo, tiene 1,9 veces mas riesgo de sufrir sobrecarga. Ser mujer cuidadora supone un riesgo 2,4 veces mayor de sufrir depresion, tener ansiedad un riesgo 4,9 mayor, sufrir sobrecarga 2,8 mayor y de nuevo estar en el tramo de edad de 31 a 50 anos se posiciona como elemento protector con el 44% menos de riesgo de sufrir depresion. Conclusiones: La mujer constituye la piedra angular sobre la que descansa la provision de cuidados informales, con una edad media de 57 anos, estudios primarios, ama de casa, sin trabajo remunerado, con ingresos por debajo del salario minimo interprofesional y dedica mas de 9 horas diarias al cuidado. Estas mujeres desempleadas, con tan escasos recursos economicos, no tienen la opcion de elegir el rol, sino que se ven abocadas al mismo ante la aparicion de un evento en el entorno familiar en el que un miembro de ella debuta con una demanda de cuidados, generandose un vinculo coyuntural “cuidadora-paciente” que termina convirtiendose en definitivo, una vez instaurado. Presentan elevados signos de ansiedad, depresion, sobrecarga y una percepcion de mala calidad de vida relacionada con la salud, y esta situacion se mantiene en el tiempo, siendo mayor en mujeres, en las que mas horas dedican al cuidado, amas de casa y las que tienen estudios primarios. La simultaneidad de roles genera peor salud mental y mayor sobrecarga en las personas cuidadoras, ya que se enfrentan a mayores desafios emocionales derivados de las dificultades del equilibrio de la prestacion de cuidados, de otras obligaciones familiares y de las laborales. A pesar del efecto que produce el cuidado en la salud mental de las cuidadoras, el consumo de ansioliticos y antidepresivos es bajo, por lo que la mayoria no reciben tratamiento farmacologico para estos trastornos. Las caracteristicas del familiar cuidado, principalmente la dependencia y el deterioro cognitivo, elevan los niveles de ansiedad, depresion y sobrecarga en las personas cuidadoras. La frecuentacion a consultas de Atencion Primaria esta por debajo de la media nacional, siendo la enfermera de familia el profesional de mas visitado y son las personas de mayor edad, que dedican mas horas al cuidado y con mayores niveles de ansiedad las que mas acuden a los equipos de Atencion Primaria.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Using data from the first two waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD), this study examined (1) housing characteristics of elders by their baseline living arrangements: living alone, with adult children/grandchildren, and with others; and (2) whether the baseline housing characteristics were likely to be directly or indirectly associated with the subsequent stability or changes in independent living arrangement over a two-year period. Housing characteristics included were ownership status, features of structural amenities, and housing type (senior housing, with or without supportive services, and housing not specifically for seniors), and elders' self-ratings of the physical condition of their housing and the safety of their neighborhood. The results of hierarchical multinomial logistic regression analysis show that these housing variables did not mediate the direct effect of the elders' health status on their transition into coresidence with children/other relatives or into nursing homes. Only the ownership status and the housing type had small direct effects on the elders' transition into or long stay in nursing homes. Further research on the effect of physical environmental factors on older persons' independent versus coresidential living arrangements is called for.",

En casos de institucionalización, el efecto atenuante que tiene el apoyo familiar, puede verse incrementado ante la necesidad de hacer frente a una nueva etapa como la vejez. El objetivo de este estudio es analizar la frecuencia y el tipo de contactos familiares que mantienen en residencia, así como su grado de satisfacción al respecto. Todo ello, en una muestra de 50 personas mayores de 70 años institucionalizados, para lo cual se aplicó el Cuestionario de Evaluación de Calidad de Vida en contexto Residencial “CECAVI-R”. Así, los resultados muestran que los mayores, de edad más avanzadas, son quienes con mayor frecuencia, mantienen contactos familiares desde la residencia. Teniendo en cuenta el género, la frecuencia en los contactos familiares variaba en función de la persona que visitaba (nietos, hermanos, etc.). Y por último, el análisis de la satisfacción hacia las relaciones familiares es positivo, mostrándose los residentes más jóvenes como los menos satisfechos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How does marital status shape grandparent care work when grandchildren have disabilities? Based on 50 in-depth interviews with grandparents who provide various types of care for grandchildren with disabilities, we find that marital status shapes care work in three distinct ways: (1) Many who are married describe both grandparents working as a team to provide vital care; (2) Some who are married describe spouses, primarily grandfathers, who are either unable or unwilling to provide care; and (3) Many who are not married, primarily grandmothers, describe providing relatively high levels of care and support despite relatively low resources. While nearly all report a great deal of joy and satisfaction with their care work, those who are single, have greater care responsibilities, and fewer resources are more likely to report adverse social, emotional, physical, and financial impacts. More robust social policies could alleviate the impact of marital status on grandparent care work.",

In our vignette study (N = 129), we found that anger at others and anger at the pupil were significantly higher if our community participants imagined a drop out from a vocational education rather than a general education. As expected, anger directed at others was fully explained by a concern for the family's social-image (i.e., a concern for condemnation by others), while anger directed at the former pupil was fully explained by a concern for the family's self-image (i.e., a concern for their moral self-image). Thoughts for how to better understand family reactions in relation to drop out are discussed.",

Une étude de terrain effectuée dans des EHPAD a montré que certaines AS ont employé « discrètement » des expressions affectueuses telles que ma chérie aux résidents, tout en sachant que leur emploi est interdit par l'établissement. Dans ce cas, les AS transgressent les règles en pensant au bien du résident. Par ailleurs, la transgression peut se manifester par une certaine forme de violence verbale et/ou physique. Ces cas de transgression du contrat de communication font apparaître la complexité des relations entre les AS et les résidents, ainsi que leur vulnérabilité.",

This article draws on a wider evaluation of freeing to identify the key dimensions of parent child relations which influenced social work and work court decisions. In the majority of cases, there were requests to dispense with birth parents' agreement to adoption. The principal corcumstances which seen to warrant this involved inital neglect and/or poor bonding following by failure to respond to social work help after childern were in care. In most instances, the Courts endorsed the local authorities position and granted freeing order. However, serveral judgments were in parents' favour. This was related sometimes to different perspectives on the relationship between family circumstances and the precise legal grounds for freeing. Also the lengthy precedures involved menat that in a few instances the parents had apperaed to imporve thier situation and so strengthened the legal case against freeing.",

      "abstract": "In looking at the linguistic behavior of preverbal infants, I will describe their conversational abilities during the first four months of life. Obviously, the ability to participate cooperatively in shared discourse is fundamental to social development in general, and particularly to the development of communicative behavior. In a conversation, one person talks, the other listens and then responds, and the cycle is repeated in a \"give-and-take\" exchange. One can observe verbal conversational behavior in young children, and if one expands one's category of \"conversational behavior\" to include nonverbal behavior, then one can also observe such conversations in very young preverbal infants. Indeed, adults often appear to engage in conversation with infants. The adult talks, the infant smiles or vocalizes, the adult responds, and the sequence continues. Structurally these conversations closely resemble the response–reinforcer relationship. Rather than functioning to reward or strengthen infant behavior, social reinforcement may function to create a \"give-and-take\" conversational environment for the adult and infant.",

As primeiras incluem uma memória de animais de estimação na infância como um elemento importante do desenvolvimento de uma atenção ao sofrimento animal; as segundas se referem ao alinhamento a novos valores e identidades na idade adulta. Em ambos os casos, a relação com um ou mais animais é enfatizada como importante para o desenvolvimento de novas sensibilidades e/ou de engajamentos específicos e ações concretas, descortinando uma série de processos que agenciam animais e humanos.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT There has long been an interest in the United Kingdom about whether and how changes in family life affect support for older people, but nevertheless the consequences of partnership dissolution for late-life support have been little researched. Using data from the British Household Panel Study (1991–2003), this study investigated the longitudinal association between partnership dissolution and two types of support for 1,966 people aged 70 or more years: (i) informal support from children in the form of contacts and help ( e.g . household assistance including care), and (ii) formal support from community care services ( i.e . health visitor or district nurse, home-help and meals-on-wheels). The paper also examines the level of reported support among: (i) all parents aged 70 or more years and (ii) 1,453 unpartnered parents in the same age group ( i.e . those lacking the most important source of support in later life: a spouse). We found diversity in the experience of partnership dissolution in the past lives of people aged 70 or more years. Patterns of support varied by the respondent's age, whether partnered, the timing and type of partnership dissolution, and by gender, having a daughter and health status. Overall, however, partnership dissolution did not show the expected detrimental relationship with later-life support. Health needs and increasing age were strongly associated with increases in contact and informal and formal help, regardless of family history.",

      "abstract": "Family caregivers represent society's primary line of defense against institutionalization of frail elderly persons, but many are uniquely challenged by a role they are ill-prepared to assume. Early caregiving research focused primarily on describing the caregiving experience and its impact on the individuals who provide informal care to impaired elderly family members. Elder abuse researchers and those who work in the more general area of caregiving typically pay little attention to each other's results. Many aspects of providing care to a frail elderly family member can foster anger, hostility, and resentment. Among these are problem behaviors and aggressiveness on the part of care recipients. Communal relationships are characterized by behaviors on the part of both partners that are responsive to their partner's needs. A distressing aspect of providing care to a frail elderly person is the extent to which caregiving results in a loss of valued activities.",

      "title": "The Conditioning of Understanding of Social Causality by Deaf Primary School Students on Family Characteristics",
      "abstract": "The most important natural condition for the social development of the personality of any child is full-fledged interpersonal communication, which is impossible without the elementary skills of a cause-and-effect analysis of a problem situation of interaction based on an understanding of social causality, identifying causal relationships between the actions of individuals in the process of joint activity and communication. The process of developing an understanding of social causality in a child with hearing impairment has its own specifics. These children have difficulty mastering the logical connections and relationships between phenomena, events and people's actions. This hinders both their adequate assessment of others and the formation of an understanding of social causality. There is a relationship between the emotional, moral and social development of deaf children and the characteristics of the parental family. In families where both the child and the parents have hearing impairments, emotional relationships develop that are close to those that are typical for hearing families. In contrast, hearing parents cannot develop the same successful relationship with their children. Thus, the focus of our attention is the conditionality of the understanding of social causality by deaf junior schoolchildren by the characteristics of the family. Based on the foregoing, the purpose of the study is to analyze the influence of the characteristics of a family with deaf and hearing parents on the general level of development of a child's understanding of social causality, which will optimize this process in a family and educational organization. The paper presents the results of our own experimental study, containing a qualitative analysis of empirical data. It has been established that the impoverishment of understanding of social causality in deaf children with hearing parents is largely due to the inability of adult hearing people to provoke small deaf children to emotional communication. Deaf elementary school students raised by deaf parents are relatively more socially adapted and have a greater level of development of understanding of social causality than deaf elementary school students from families of hearing parents. The results of the study can be used as a basis for purposeful correctional and developmental work with deaf junior schoolchildren and their families to develop an understanding of social causation.",

Mothers (N = 203) of community preschoolers completed the Children's Night-waking Behavior Scale and measures of night-waking, co-sleeping, and daytime behavior. Approximately 1/2 of wakings involved calling out, getting out of bed, and requests for comfort; 1/4 involved activity, fear, or instrumental requests. Specific associations between night-waking behaviors, night-waking, and bedtime and daytime behaviors were observed; associations were not consistent across child gender and age. For example, comfort requests were associated with mothers' perceptions of sleep as problematic in 4- and 5-year-old children only (ρ = .42); activity requests were associated with hyperactivity for boys only (r = .36). Understanding night-waking requires consideration of factors beyond parenting, such as children's behavior, age, and gender.",

Beberapa bentuk pelampiasan yang dapat dili h at adalah mudah tersinggung, tidak dapat diikuti jalan pemikirannya ataupun perasaannya, ada kecenderungan menarik diri dari keluarga atau teman, lebih senang menyendiri, me n entang kewenangan, sangat mendambakan kemandirian, sangat kritis terhadap orang lain, tidak suka melakukan tugas rumah ataupun sekolah, dan sangat tampak bahwa dirinya tidak bahagia. Proses imitasi yang dialami remaja cenderung berjalan sesuai dengan keadaan yang terjadi pada saat remaja itu sendiri menjalani kehidupannya. Dalam konteks psikologi, pembentukan identitas merupakan tugas utama dalam perkembangan kepribadian yang diharapkan tercapai pada akhir masa remaja. J ika dalam perkembangan itu dapat diatur dengan baik , tentu akan berpengaruh baik terhadap kekuatan psikososial. Secara psikologis , h al itu mempengaruhi pola pikir dan pola sikap dari dalam jiwa remaja itu sendiri k arena remaja belum mampu menguasai dan memfungsikan secara maksimal fisik maupun psikisnya. Namun, yang perlu ditekankan di sini adalah bahwa fase remaja merupakan fase  perkembangan yang tengah berada pada fase amat potensial, baik dilihat dari aspek kognitif, emosi, maupun fisik.

      "title": "Quality of life according to the perception of informal caregivers of patients with Down syndrome",
      "abstract": "Introducción El Síndrome de Down (SD) o Trisomía del Par 21 es la cromosomopatía más frecuente, con una incidencia de 1 de 600 a 700 nacidos. Su diagnóstico genera un gran impacto tanto físico, psicológico y social en la familia. Estudios reportan que las madres con edad más avanzada al dar a luz a un hijo con SD tenían un mejor bienestar, al igual que aquellas que participaban en grupos de apoyo. Asimismo, se evaluó la calidad de vida de los cuidadores de niños y adolescentes con SD y se obtuvo que el 84% calificó su calidad de vida como “buena” y el 55% dijo sentirse “satisfecho”, influyendo las variables de educación y estatus socioeconómico. Un cuidador es cualquier persona que, de forma gradual o repentina, ha de añadir a su quehacer cotidiano la tarea “extra” de atender y cuidar a una persona enferma o dependiente. El cuidador informal es quien se encarga de atender las necesidades físicas y emocionales de la persona dependiente. Generalmente es un familiar cercano o alguien significativo dentro de la vida del paciente, quien en ocasiones decide voluntariamente ser cuidador y en otros casos le es asignado este rol circunstancialmente por la dinámica familiar. A pesar de los esfuerzos de la OMS por incluir el bienestar de los miembros de la familia y los cuidadores de pacientes que sufren SD, sus necesidades no son evaluadas de manera sistemática. Objetivos Evaluar los niveles de calidad de vida de acuerdo con la percepción de los cuidadores informales de pacientes con Síndrome de Down Método Estudio descriptivo, analítico y correlacional. Se evaluaron 32 cuidadores informales de pacientes con Síndrome de Down residentes en Ecuador. Se incluyeron individuos que cumplían con la tarea de cuidado informal de pacientes con síndrome de Down. Criterios de selección: cuidadores que dedicaban al menos tres cuartas partes del día a la tarea de cuidado, durante un mínimo de cinco días semanales y con al menos doce semanas cumpliendo dicha labor. El instrumento WHOQOL-Bref se sometió a validez y confiabilidad obteniendo como resultado Coeficiente Alpha de Cronbach α=0,916. Para el análisis de la información se diseñó la matriz de datos en Excel, se utilizó el paquete estadístico de Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 25) para procesar cada uno de los datos obtenidos a través de tablas y gráficos, partir de la estadística descriptiva. Principales resultados Se evaluó los niveles de calidad de vida de acuerdo con la percepción de los cuidadores informales de pacientes con Síndrome de Down. El rendimiento de la calidad de vida evaluado mediante la aplicación del WHOQOL-Bref reportó los siguientes niveles: Salud física, 50.0% de los participantes la juzgó de forma deficiente frente a un 9.4% que la asumió muy buena. Salud psicológica de manera global el 62.5% la valoró negativamente con calificativos que van de regular (28.1%) a deficiente (34.4). Relaciones sociales: 65.6 % las considera deficiente, 18.7 % regular, 12.5 % buena y apenas 3.1 % muy buena Medio ambiente: 43.7 % considera regular, 31.2 % bueno, 15.6 % muy buena y 9.4 % deficiente. Los datos permiten evidenciar que el cuidado informar puede afectar la vida de quien ejerce este rol, se aprecia un rendimiento mínimo de las dimensiones de relaciones sociales, salud física y psicológica de los cuidadores. Se observó que la salud física se afectó hasta un 50%, la salud psicológica 62.5%, las relaciones sociales 65.6% y el medio ambiente 43.7%. Es oportuno señalar que en la categoría excelente no se registró a ningún cuidador. Conclusiones El impacto emocional con déficit marcado en la esfera relacional se refleja en el deterioro general de su calidad de vida lo que expone al cuidador a problemas personales, psíquicos y sociales producto de las exigencias de sobre carga laboral y menor tiempo a su autocuidado, rebasando el deterioro significativo de las diversas dimensiones que componen su calidad de vida.",

      "abstract": "Scotland, England and Wales have the highest imprisonment rates in Western Europe.1 A number of studies2 have highlighted the devastating impact of parental imprisonment on children. As well as a significant sense of loss, many children experience stigma, social isolation, shame and fear.3 This underlines the need to use non-custodial measures wherever possible to reduce the disruption and trauma of a parent’s imprisonment.4 Parental imprisonment can have a negative impact on children’s short-term emotional well-being, as well as their long-term health and social prospects.5 Women, who are more likely to be primary carers, tend to receive short sentences for non-violent crimes without consideration of the impact on their children.6 Separation from a mother is particularly traumatic, and children affected often face greater disruption as it is more likely to involve other changes (eg, carer, home and school).7 Children with imprisoned mothers often reside with grandparents, who may also need practical and financial support.8 \n\nDespite the adversities they face, children affected by imprisonment are rarely recognised as a distinct group within the systems and structures that should protect them, and no government agency is responsible for their well-being.9 While no systematic recording and monitoring system is in place, a 2019 report estimates that around 312 000 children are affected annually by parental imprisonment in England and Wales.10 \n\nThe imprisonment of …",

      "title": "Estrangement and Impact on Family Communication",
      "abstract": "Family estrangement occurs when at least one family member voluntarily and intentionally distances themselves from another family member because of an often ongoing negative relationship. Similar to divorce, parent–child estrangement can be an intergenerational issue; this means that adult children who distance themselves from their parents might eventually be distanced from their own children. Although it can be a healthy solution to an unhealthy environment, research suggests that estrangement can be complicated (e.g., marked by on-again/off-again cycles), uncertain, disenfranchised, stigmatized, and unsupported. Considering families are interdependent systems, the impact of family distancing can affect each and every member of the family, regardless of whether a person is directly involved. Nevertheless, parents, children, immediate family members, and siblings have varying and nuanced perspectives. For example, parents often desire reconnection and reconciliation, whereas adult children often do not. Siblings often face a different dynamic considering the power relationships between siblings are more horizontal than vertical. This means that siblings often have the same amount of power (i.e., horizontal) compared to parents and children (i.e., vertical), in which there is a greater power difference. Overall, the study of family estrangement is relatively new regardless of discipline; more research will be needed to characterize this experience and test related outcomes. Indeed, even though there is hardly any research at all, there is even less quantitative research. Continuing the study of family estrangement is important, however, considering it calls into question the inevitability of family relationships, which, albeit concerning to some, opens up the possibility to reconceptualize family to de-emphasize biological ties and emphasize care and communication.",

      "title": "Teorías subjetivas sobre el tiempo de espera y experiencias de la parentalidad adoptiva",
      "abstract": "The adoption process includes important changes in adoptive families, since it implies a restructuring and adaptation to a new organization of the family system. The path to parenthood entails changes at levels of mental, physical and social health, which in the case of adoptive parents, the challenges are greater or are altered in some way due to the unique characteristics of their experiences and the obstacles they face. To these challenges are added the usual stressors that parents face, such as changes in roles, increased stress, lack of sleep, alterations in the relationship and intimacy of the couple and difficulties that arise in raising their children. On the other hand, time is configured as a concrete dimension through which life develop. The relationship between objective time and subjective or psychological time will shape the perception of time that each person has, which has a role in how both individual and family identity develops. This is because people´s actions are influenced by past experiences, current experiences and future expectations. One of the areas of the adoption process that has not yet been deepened is the waiting time, the period of time between obtaining the suitability and assignment of the minor to the adoptive family, which can be considered important for the future family depending on how adoptive parents face it, this because the way in which the adoption process is experienced impacts both the path to parenthood and post-adoption adaptation. In fact, it confirms that waiting time influences the psychological well-being of adoptive parents. Therefore, it is possible to say that adoptive parents elaborate subjective theories about this process and especially in relation to the waiting time for adoption, explanations that could influence the way in which they face this new challenge and prepare for parenthood. The present study aimed to understand subjective theories about the waiting time and experiences of adoptive parenting. Ten adoptive mothers and fathers participated in this study through individual episodic interviews. The data obtained were analyzed using techniques of three analysis procedures: content based on Grounded Theory, specific for subjective theories and time perspective. From the findings, subjective theories of anxious emotional content during the adoption process stand out, since parents experience great uncertainty, either in terms of how long they can wait before being paired with a child or in terms of the perception of a lack of transparency regarding the real possibilities of adoption given their preferences and abilities, emotions will depend on the handling of information and the accompaniment that they have. The main coping strategies used by the adoptive parents were having a support network, sharing experiences with other parents and the use of personal strategies are the main adaptation strategies of adoptive parents, which they allow them to cope with negative feelings during the process. Also, their concerns focus on the lack of protection of children and the health conditions in which they are received, this given the possibility that they couldn’t recover the child's integral health and that the period they have remained institutionalized is a risk factor for attachment. Regarding the limitations, it should be noted that emerging families such as reunified, homo or single-parent families were not included in this study, but rather it was focused on interviewing families whose configuration is considered to be traditional. Finally, important points to deepen in future research would be the study of subjective theories on adaptation of adoptive families with different configurations, also replicating studies that allow establishing the concept of waiting time in adoption and studies that include adoptive parenting experiences on parents of minors with health or developmental problems. https://doi.org/10.16888/interd.2023.40.2.23",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size NotesThough I will refer to “mother” as the primary caretaker throughout this paper, this does not exclude the possibility of another person—a nanny, a grandparent, an adoptive parent, etc.—acting as the primary caretaker for the child. It is conceivable that there can be a substitute for the mother in watched play if the caregiver meets the criteria for relational representation and is thus a substitute identificatory model for the child. However, it is of note that the identificatory process discussed below is facilitated by the presence of a single primary caretaker, so that variations of this situation (for example, two or more primary caretakers or a single-father household) may involve psychic processes different from those I describe (e.g., variations in identification).This, of course, excludes the pathological and generalized inability to comprehend emotional states in others, as seen in autistic spectrum (axis I), antisocial, and narcissistic personality disorders (axis II), among others.For a comprehensive discussion of the role of the mother in affect-mirroring, which builds both internal and external attributional capacity, see Gergely and Watson (1996). These authors develop a social biofeedback model in which the infant learns to distinguish the parent’s marked and realistic displays of emotion, the former corresponding to the baby’s own affective state as the parent mirrors it in a particular, exaggerated way, and the latter corresponding to the parent’s affective state. In normal development, the infant learns to differentiate between these two emotional states on the basis of the external social cues and behaviors preceding and following an affective event.I am grateful to Rolf Kunstlicher and Nathaniel Karush for the suggestions that inspired these thoughts.Additional informationNotes on contributorsSusan P.

The nest (family) becomes emptying due to departure of young ones, with the presence of only elderly called empty-nest family, and the elderly in the family are empty nest elderly. Lowered interaction, rare visits, and less intensity of communication with the young adults, family conflict, strained parental relationship, abuse and neglect, poor physical health, financial stress, lack of social capital, social support, and poor social network cause the higher level of mental health conditions such as loneliness, depression, stress, anxiety, fear, lower cognitive ability, and lower life satisfaction. Regular contacts, frequent visits, interaction with the children, grandchildren, friends, neighbors, and relatives directly or through phone, good marital relationship, good health, physical activities, financial stability, cognitive skill, self-efficacy, social capital, social support, and social network are the elements that promote the mental well-being of the empty nest elderly. Providing awareness by the mental health professionals on empty-nest transition and coping mechanisms, transnational care, daycare centers, and elderly parks to involve them with yoga, meditation, and physical exercises; entertaining them through dance and music; and taking them for excursions are the strategies that could be adopted to raise the quality of life and improve the mental well-being of the empty nest elderly.",

A conceptual definition of neglect is presented based on an ecological model of child maltreatment. The definition focuses on the basic needs of children that are not met, rather than on the intentions or behavior of parents. The replacement of parental culpability by a shared responsibility including parents, families, the community, and society is suggested. Neglect is seen as a heterogeneous phenomenon that varies by type, severity, and chronicity. In addition, neglect is understood as existing on a continuum ranging from optimal to grossly inadequate care. The context within which neglect occurs, including parents' understanding of children's needs, religious and cultural beliefs, and poverty, influences the approaches of clinicians, researchers, and policymakers toward the problem of child neglect.",

Inversement, les jeunes de milieux populaires qui ne sont pas mobiles et prolongent la cohabitation au domicile parental sont en situation de pouvoir bénéficier des solidarités familiales qui leur permettent, faute d’accéder à l’indépendance économique et résidentielle par l’entrée dans l’activité professionnelle stable, d’attendre en étant sécurisés matériellement et affectivement.

Brown, Advisor This research uses Fragile Families data to examine the ways in which father involvement is associated with relationship quality and transitions from cohabitation into either marriage or separation among new parents. It is widely recognized that cohabiting unions are more unstable than marriages and are typically short-lived. With the dramatic increase in cohabiting unions and 19 percent of children being born to cohabiting parents (Child Trends, 2007), understanding the processes through which cohabiting families with children survive or dissolve is vitally important. Research on the processes leading to marriage, or at least stable long-term unions, as well as an examination of the role of father involvement in these processes is needed. My dissertation research includes three central research questions: (1) What is the level of father involvement by union status/transition and do mothers and fathers report similar levels of father involvement?; (2) How are father involvement and coparenting associated with relationship quality among cohabiting and married parents?; (3) How are relationship and parenting characteristics associated with transitions out of cohabitation, through marriage or separation? I find that resident fathers (cohabiting or married) spend the most time with their children, regardless of whether they are continuously resident or become resident over the observation period, and resident parents have the least discrepancy between their reports. Nonresident fathers exhibit the lowest levels of involvement and the highest levels of discrepancy between reporters. Continuously married parents report the highest level of supportiveness from their spouse. There is no difference in supportiveness",

      "abstract": "The percentage of young American adults residing in their parents’ home has increased markedly over recent years, but we know little about how sociodemographic, life-course, and parental characteristics facilitate or impede leaving or returning home. We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics’ Transition into Adulthood survey to examine the determinants of leaving and returning home among youth who turned age 18 between 2005 and 2011. Findings from event-history models show that while leaving and returning home is to some extent a function of normative life-course transitions, characteristics of the parental home (e.g., presence of coresident siblings, mother’s educational attainment) and the degree of family connectivity (e.g., emotional closeness to mother, instrumental help from family) also play important roles. Experiencing physical, including sexual, victimization drives young adults both out of, and back into, the parental home. Having parents in poor physical health encourages young adults to move back home. Overall, the results suggest that a comprehensive explanation for both home-leaving and home-returning will need to look beyond life-course transitions and standard economic accounts to encompass a broader array of push and pull factors, particularly those that bond young adults with their parents.",

Korean American families live in two cultures and the issue of acculturation challenges their parenting, which is a critical factor for young adolescents’ psychological adjustment. METHODS: Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyze 106 family data (young adolescents, mothers, and fathers) on parenting (acceptance–rejection and behavioral control), acculturation (integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization), and young adolescents’ psychological adjustment. FINDINGS: Only young adolescents’ reports of maternal and paternal acceptance–rejection were related to their report of psychological adjustment. However, maternal acculturation moderated the relation between mothers’ reports of maternal acceptance–rejection and behavioral control and young adolescents’ report of their psychological adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Parental acceptance–rejection is related to young adolescents’ psychological adjustment when adolescents perceive themselves as accepted or rejected by parents. The relation between mothers’ report of maternal acceptance–rejection and behavioral control and adolescents’ psychological adjustment needs to be considered within the context of maternal acculturation.",

      "title": "Helping Children Cope with Divorce, Death, and Deployment",
      "abstract": "During the past decade, pediatricians have increasingly incorporated the social-ecological model of health into their practices, recognizing the profound interactions between environmental and individual factors in child health outcomes. Despite a growing awareness of the social determinants of health, comparatively little attention has been given to the impact of a child being separated from a parent, despite the fact that more than 1 million American children experience divorce, death of a parent, or deployment of a parent each year.Although divorce, parental death, and deployment arise from dramatically different family circumstances, each of these events can have lasting effects on involved children. For pediatricians, routine health supervision visits should include surveillance of stressors associated with either a current or impending separation, as well as the social and familial changes that can occur before, during, and after such experiences. When assessing a child undergoing a temporary or permanent separation from a parent, a pediatrician should be aware of the health risks experienced by the child, as well as being prepared to offer an appropriate palette of options for support to the child and caregiver(s).Special attention should be given to a patient’s developmental stage because children of different ages will present with sequelae of varying types and severities. For example, developing secure attachment to caregivers is an important feature of infancy and early childhood; thus, a change in a child’s day-to-day routine or the presence or absence of particular caregivers may result in increased fussiness or irritability, regression of developmental milestones, or disturbance in sleep and feeding patterns. As children mature, their understanding of parent separation likewise evolves. For example, in the context of divorce, older children will have an increasing understanding of the permanence of divorce as well as the abstract and complex issues involved. For adolescents, increased risk-taking behavior, poor school performance, depression, or anxiety can be associated with all types of parent separation.Beyond developmental factors, family and social risk factors are also relevant. In the case of the bereaved child, the preceding levels of family cohesion are strong predictors of behavioral and emotional symptoms after a parent’s death. With divorce, children with an easy-going temperament and average or higher cognitive abilities are better able to seek out support and adapt to change. When a parent is deployed, the nondeployed parent’s ability to engage his or her own support systems influences the child’s own behavior and coping. Conversely, numerous negative risk factors increase the possibility of poor health and behavior outcomes. For example, any parent separation can exacerbate financial difficulties and the ability of a remaining parent to find adequate child care. A child may encounter disrupted family or community supports and experience maladaptive parenting behaviors due to the caregiver’s own mental health needs, which may or may not be related to the separation. In addition, health-care providers should be alert to the risk of neglect and abuse, which are increased in the period during and after a military deployment.The behavior changes associated with divorce or death generally last for 6 to 12 months, followed by a return to the child’s previous function by 2 to 3 years. However, somatic (nonspecific complaints such as stomachaches or headaches) and behavioral (includes problems with school, attention, mood, anger, sleep, eating disorders, or substance abuse) symptoms can persist or return in the context of special days such as birthdays or holidays or with additional stressors such as family conflict or new living situations. In addition, divorce and death can result in long-term sequelae related to difficulty with long-term relationships (both as an adolescent and later as an adult), an increased risk of suicide, and persistent academic and behavioral problems. However, although there are many similarities in the way that a child responds to the absence of a parent, the social particularities of each type of separation can also result in differences in long-term behaviors and well-being.Divorce can be a dynamic process, introducing new conflicts and transitions as the relationships between parents and children evolve, such as the introduction of a stepparent or changes in school or home environments. The presence of parental conflict can be a particularly detrimental factor compounding the stress of these transitions. Witnessing conflict exposes children to toxic stress, and persistent negativity between parents can disrupt parental attachment, forcing children to feel the need to take one parent’s side over the other. In addition, because children are often caught in the middle, they can experience increased anxiety related to blaming themselves for the separation and feeling burdened with facilitating their parents’ reunification.In contrast to the often unpredictable chronology of divorce, the stresses of deployment tend to be concentrated at discrete points, most commonly times of deployment and reintegration. Of the more than 1 million service members with children who have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, 48% of them served 2 or more deployments, with the average deployment lasting 7.7 months. The deployments were followed by a 3- to 6-month period of reintegration, where 44% of service members reported readjustment difficulties, with similar percentages describing strains on family life (48%), outbursts of anger (47%), and posttraumatic stress (49%). Much of the stress around reintegration is related to adjustment to the changing familial roles that arise during a deployment as well as the developmental transitions that a family member may have missed while deployed, such as infants who have developed new tantrums or increased independence while the parent was away. Younger adolescents seem to have the most difficulty with reintegration because they may be required to relinquish authority and responsibility that they had assumed in their family during the absence of the deployed parent.Children experiencing the death of a family member can move through predictable stages of grief that can vary in length according to the developmental stage of the child and the particulars of their environment. In general, children may require extra support from families and clinicians for feelings of guilt and abandonment during the initial stages of grieving as they learn not only to accept the immediate reality of loss but also the longer-term implications of the loss on their family and community. In addition, they can experience loneliness when caregivers withhold information in an attempt to protect them from the distressing details of the parent’s condition or when the surviving parent hides his or her emotions in an attempt to protect, but the child unfortunately ends up grieving alone. In the later stages of grieving, children will begin to reinvest in new relationships and return to developmentally appropriate activities; however, families should be alert for the return of pain and grief as children go through important events in their lives.Due to the complex interplay of medical, developmental, and social factors in parental separation, intervention requires an individualized approach. However, certain principles will be helpful in a broad range of scenarios.First, children have great capacity for resilience. A strong system of support should be encouraged that includes parents, other family members, peers, and professionals. Programs of varying intensities and lengths exist, including parent-child counseling, support groups, camps, writing activities, group-based interventions, and interactive online modules. Specific programs to address divorce, death, and deployment have been developed to shepherd families through the distinct adjustments that each type of separation can require. Military bases offer a robust set of resources for families living nearby, although in the case of reservists (ie, National Guard), it is possible that a family could live far from a military community and see more benefit from web-based resources. In addition, schools can be valuable partners in providing support and assessment.Second, separation from a parent may be the most traumatic and life-changing event that has ever happened to a child. Parents should be counseled to prioritize compassion and transparency because children need to sense that their caregivers are trustworthy and that their world will retain a semblance of order. Children as young as preschool should be given honest and appropriate information. Caregivers should provide children with information about how changes in their family will affect their day-to-day lives; children should be invited to share their feelings and have their questions patiently answered. Difficult concepts such as death, divorce, or an impending deployment should be explained in developmentally appropriate terms because children will attempt to fill in gaps in knowledge by themselves if information is withheld; often their imagined narrative can perpetuate a fear of further abandonment or self-blame. If parents feel ill-equipped, health-care providers, school staff, or religious leaders can assist in facilitating these conversations.Such honest discussions can be particularly valuable when there is an opportunity for gentle, developmentally appropriate end-of-life information to be given to a child before the death of a parent. Such conversations, in conjunction with opportunities to be physically present with the loved one, can allow the dying parent to play an important role of comforting the child in his or her grief.Third, children should be provided with as much consistency as possible in the midst of a changing environment. Children from infants to adolescents will benefit from maintenance of a consistent schedule, reliable demonstrations of affection, good 2-way communication, and regular quality time with their caregiver. Children may test behavioral boundaries with a different or newly single caregiver; nonetheless, discipline techniques should remain clear and consistent.Finally, parents and caregivers should also consider their personal self-care, particularly with respect to mental health. In the case of divorce, a child’s successful adjustment requires minimizing exposure to conflict and prioritizing cooperative parenting. For bereaved children, depression in surviving parents is a strong predictor of behavior disturbance in preschoolers. Regarding deployment, the challenge of separation is often exacerbated by injuries such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, the “invisible wounds” that expose family members to the secondary trauma of war.Separation from parents is a distressing but common occurrence for children in America and throughout the world. Pediatricians are strategically positioned to identify children experiencing parental separation and should be prepared to offer effective education and resources to ensure optimal adjustment to the changes taking place in the life of a family.COMMENT: Assisting a patient and family with the grief and suffering associated with separations may be one of the most rewarding journeys that we embark on as pediatric health-care providers. However, patients and families may not always think to inform us of these experiences or may be initially reluctant to share this information. Hence, it is critical for health-care providers to take the initiative to ask at each visit about family stressors and separations. Although limited time during encounters is always an issue, it is inevitably time well spent in these circumstances. This may be one of our most important roles as child advocates and understanding the dynamics of the families that we serve. Using our skills to listen carefully and to be fully present enables us to provide guidance, support, and resources that will strengthen the longitudinal relationship that we value in our role as healers while simultaneously improving the quality of the lives of our patients and their emotional health.",

      "title": "Continuity of Learning: adding funds of knowledge from the home environment",
      "abstract": "In comparison to previous generations, families these days are leading increasingly complex lives. Children often have a diversity of experiences from various learning communities before they begin school. For example, they may have been involved in one or more early childhood settings before moving on to school, where they join the new community of the school; and they have the of the home community, which may or may not involve an extended family. They may be involved in cultural, sporting, artistic, and/or spiritual communities. A child may be involved in many communities each week, or may a number of different communities over a period of time. This can be referred to as the multidimensionality of student experience (Gonzalez, Moll, & Amanti, 2005, p. 6). Some of these communities may be very similar to each other--for example, involvement in a spiritual community may in many ways require of activities similar to those practised at home. Some communities may be very disparate; for example, a swimming lesson may operate very differently from a play group and have a different set of expectations and modes of participation. The constant factor, however, is the mediating one of the family. This article explores the families have of their child and the importance for teachers, families, and the child of sharing this knowledge. Funds of In their book Funds of Knowledge Norma Gonzales, Luis Moll, and Cathy Amanti define of knowledge as being based on a simple premise: People are competent, they have knowledge, and their life experiences have given them that knowledge (2005, p. ix). Gonzales et al. focus on developing reciprocal relationships with families, in part to identify the knowledge, skills, and experiences of families that could be shared with the to enhance classroom practice and students' learning: [a] funds of approach facilitates a systematic and powerful way to represent communities in terms of resources, the wherewithal they possess, and how to harness these resources for classroom teachers (p. x). As well as viewing a family's skills and as resources the teacher can tap into, it is also possible to see the family as a mediating factor in terms of the child's interactions with the various learning communities the child is involved in (as shown in Figure 1). This view highlights the necessity of developing reciprocal and responsive relationships between the family and the centre or classroom. In this framework the family can be seen as a pivotal point and constant frame of reference for the child. At any one time a child is a participant in many communities, not just one. It is the family, as the mediating factor, that has the of the child's of these things. Communities of practice When we look more closely at the child's of, and between, these communities, a useful concept is Etienne Wenger's (1998) definition of a community of practice as a living context that can give newcomers access to competence and also invite a personal of engagement by which to incorporate that competence into an identity of (p. 214). Children come to an early childhood centre or school with varying experiences of participation. Each of the communities they have been a part of may have functioned in entirely different ways, with a multitude of different foci. How they have approached these different settings and how their sense of belonging, engagement, and participation has developed are important indicators for a teacher in deciding how to scaffold and bridge a child's entry into, and learning within, any community of learning. Once again, it is often the family that holds this information. Reciprocal relationships In their exploration of funds of Gonzales et al.

      "title": "Besonderheiten moderner Rehabilitation beim betagten Menschen",
      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Aufgrund der demografischen Entwicklung gewinnt die Rehabilitation Betagter an Bedeutung. Im Vergleich zum jüngeren Patienten sind beim betagten Patienten die Autonomie und die Handlungsfähigkeit in Alltagssituationen meist rascher bedroht, die soziale Partizipation fragiler, und somit die Gefahr der Vereinsamung prinzipiell grösser. Die Kommunikation mit dem Umfeld spielt eine grössere Rolle. Das Risiko für Komplikationen ist hoch; andererseits äussern betagte Patienten in der Regel weniger Angst vor dem Tod als vor einem völligen Verlust der Selbständigkeit und davor, ihren Angehörigen «zur Last zu fallen». Auch betagte Patienten profitieren von organspezifischen Rehabilitationsmassnahmen auf dem Niveau der Alltagsfunktionalität und sozialen Partizipation, wie dies exemplarisch für die Neurorehabilitation nach Schlagfanfall gezeigt wurde. Die geriatrische Rehabilitation fokussiert spezifisch auf die Bedürfnisse Betagter, die durch Multimorbidität, Vulnerabilität oder Gebrechlichkeit (Frailty) charakterisiert sind. Sie ist als interprofessioneller Prozess aufgebaut, der polymodal körperliche, psychische und soziale Aspekte systematisch erfasst und mit dem Patienten und seinem Umfeld ein individuell adaptiertes Ziel erarbeitet. Zentral sind die Aspekte Mobilität, Selbsthilfefähigkeit, Ernährung, Kognition, Stimmung, Kontinenz und soziale Situation. Ein Tragpfeiler ist dabei eine altersadaptierte, proteinreiche Ernährung. Ärztlicherseits wird es – gerade bei der Rehabilitation Betagter – hilfreich sein, die Kompetenzen aus verschiedenen Fachrichtungen synergistisch zu nutzen. Unter der Vorstellung einer optimalen Betreuung und Beratung gerade in den Kompetenzfeldern Mobilität, Kognition und Ernährung kann eine Co-Betreuung ein zukunftsfähiges Modell sein. Im Hinblick auf die rehabilitative Prognose dürfte «Alter» im Sinne der Anzahl bisheriger Lebensjahre eine überschätzte Prognosevariable sein. «Höheres Alter» kann hingegen als Surrogatmarker für Komorbiditäten gelten, die mit zunehmendem Lebensalter an Häufigkeit zunehmen. Unter diesen Gesichtspunkten ist es unbedingt zu vermeiden, dass betagte Patienten rein auf Grund ihrer bereits verbrachten Lebensjahre weniger häufig als Jüngere die Chance einer rehabilitativen Behandlung erhalten.",

Equally known is the damage caused by severed relationships. Recent literature has suggested an increased incidence of grandparents raising their grandchildren, often after family breakdown. Less evident in the literature is grandparents' experience of reduced, lost, or denied contact with their grandchildren. In the qualitative, exploratory study reported here, the lived experiences of 21 Queensland grandparents were documented through in-depth interviews. The overall findings suggest that disrupted, lost, or denied contact with grandchildren was very distressing and impacted on grandparents' health; that seeking to safeguard and support grandchildren could result in damaged family relationships and denied contact; and that a cycle of lost and regained contact can occur in some circumstances. These findings indicate that an increased role for social workers may be warranted, in listening to and including grandparents when working with families, and recognising grandparents' need for support.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment theory and family systems perspectives were used to explore the intergenerational origins of an overinvolved, symbiotic parenting pattern that hampers children's emerging autonomy. Consistent with principles of developmental psychopathology, the same underlying relationship disturbance was expected to manifest differently at different times in the developmental process. Specifically, links among maternal intrusiveness during infancy, overprotection during childhood, and mother-child role-reversal during young adulthood were explored. Forty-nine maternal grandmothers, mothers, and firstborn infants were visited in the mothers' homes when the infants were 6 and 9 months old. Grandmothers' memories of overprotection were related to observational ratings of high boundary dissolution and low positive affectivity with the mothers. No significant relationships were found between mothers' past and current relationships with the grandmothers. Yet, mothers' memories of overprotection during childhood or their current participation in unaffectionate, enmeshed, and role-reversed relationships with their mothers forecast their intrusive care with their own infants. Moreover, mothers' memories of overprotection related to their beliefs that others cannot be trusted and these beliefs were related, in turn, to observations of their intrusive care at 9 months. The implications of understanding the origins of maternal intrusiveness for developing prevention programs are discussed.",

Whereas 30 years ago especially behavior disorders were found to be correlating, today the situation is more differentiate. Results suggest, that the effects of maternal employment have changed the years. The effects depend on the degree of the mother's satisfaction with her work, the sex of the children, social class, children's age, residential area, substitute care, the possibility to conciliate working and private needs as well as the attitude of society regarding working mothers. The part of the father in this connection is controversial. Lately unconscious motives of working (e.g. career drive resulting from early familial conflicts, marriage problems) or non-working (e.g. fear of occupational conflicts) mothers are regarded more intensively. Correlations are especially found to sex role understanding of the children, as well as to intelectual development and emotional stability dependent on further factors.",

The children of residential groups are not allowed to have any face-to-face contact with their parents. This is especially difficult for children who have just been transferred into long-term residential services and for those who have a strong emotional bond to their parents. Homeschooling creates a particular challenge for residential groups. Groups with eight children of different ages are usually staffed with one caregiver, who obviously cannot help all children simultaneously. This is especially difficult as all the children work on different tasks and many of the children have learning difficulties and/or problems with motivation and concentration.",

Systems that are successful in enacting family integrity successfully cope with transitions and reach family resilience.

Método: Enfoque cualitativo con 7 entrevistas semiestructuradas individuales a cuidadoras adultas en el sur y poniente de la región. Resultados: Fueron categorizadas experiencias y subjetividades que expresan la importancia que las mujeres atribuyen al cuidado de sus familiares, con una escasa demostración emocional durante esta etapa. Además, emergen categorías como rutinas y roles, donde muchas mujeres priorizan el cuidado; redes de apoyo, con relatos frecuentes sobre la falta de ayuda y herramientas más allá de lo económico; y áreas de ocupación afectadas, predominantemente el descanso y sueño, aunque también se menciona el autocuidado y la participación social. Conclusión: Si bien el proceso de duelo anticipado genera dolor y desgaste propio, es el cuidado informal lo que genera cambios en la participación y calidad de vida de las mujeres cuidadoras.",

In the past decade, as result of the implementation of the one-child-per couple family policy and other radical social and economic reforms, the context of Chinese parents has changed dramatically, especially in urban areas. These changes have greatly impacted parental attitudes toward child care and their parenting practices. One area of change is the array of child care arrangements available to parents with young children in urban areas. Children may attend a daytime daycare or a full time daycare center (boarding school) where the child spends the night and returns to their parents on weekends. In addition, parents can keep their children at home with either set of grandparents providing the care or the parents themselves can serve as caretakers. They can also hire a baby-sitter to take care of their child as an alternative.",

      "abstract": "All parents face a new stressor when an infant joins the family; most have not likely faced the intense and evocative stimuli of an infant in their care crying for prolonged durations. For most parents, their infant’s crying takes up a small portion of a day, and as parents learn the cues or signals specific to their infant they become more effective at soothing a cry and preventing situations likely to trigger another bout. Indeed, one might summarize a common conceptualization of crying thusly: Something has triggered the infant’s cry, the cry signals a specific need, parents should respond with the appropriate remedy to stop the cry, and parents should learn from these experiences to anticipate and prevent their infant’s future distress (Barr, Hopkins, & Green, 2000). Our broader social awareness of crying and our culturally influenced beliefs about parents’ role in their infants’ cries are communicated explicitly through direct and often verbal means, and through implicit, unspoken exchanges. Parents (perhaps irrationally) fear the demands of the public – why can’t you keep your baby quiet? – just as they dread the pointed glares shot to them when their infant cries in public. Both types of communication convey a social attitude towards crying: It is the parents’ role to meet the needs of their infant to keep crying to a minimum.",

However, the linking of the phenomenon of the social maladjustment of minors in Poland mostly with political changes and the distinguishing in the first place such cau-ses of dysfunction as: difficult socio-economic conditions, or low parenting competence of parents, is an incomplete diagnosis. The foundation of the problem of juvenile social ma-ladjustment should be seen rather in the disturbed emotional bonds in the family. In the era of atomization of social life a growing problem is the building of weak or negative family ties or their complete absence. Family ties have often only an instrumental character.",

      "title": "Adoption: Where Do Relatives Stand?.",
      "abstract": "For many children in out-of-home care, adoption is the most appropriate permanent arrangement. Where do relatives stand in the adoption process? Three aspects of the law's treatment of blood relationships are reviewed in this article: (1) the ability of relatives to participate in adoption proceedings, (2) how courts evaluate blood relationships in determining the best interests of the child, and (3) the right of relatives to continued contact when a child is adopted by nonrelatives. Policy and practice implications are offered. For children in out-of-home care who cannot be returned home, adoption is an important permanency option. Much of the current discussion regarding children in out-ofhome care and their kin has concerned formal kinship care and alternatives to relative adoption [Child Welfare League of America 1994; Takas 1994], but for some children, adoption is the most appropriate alternative. Adoption practice has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. It is no longer just the practice of finding healthy infants for infertile, middle-class couples. Many of the children available for adoption today have special needs. They are older children and adolescents, children with disabilities, children in sibling groups, and children with emotional and behavioral problems. Typically, these children have spent years in out-of-home care, either with relatives or unrelated adults, before being legally available for adoption. As of the end of 1993, an estimated 445,000 children were in out-ofhome care, and of these children, an estimated 15%, or 66,750, had the permanency goal of adoption [Tatara 1995]. Child welfare experts know that adoption is a lifelong process, that is, feelings of grief and loss by all members of the adoption triad do not end once the adoption is legalized but can resurface throughout the lives of those affected by adoption [Child Welfare League of America 1989]. Adoption may remove children's legal connections to their biological roots, but it cannot erase their emotional relationships with blood-related kin. Neither the law nor the field of child welfare has determined what importance should be placed on blood relationships in the adoption process that severs all of the child's ties to the biological family. There is consensus, however, that the ways these relationships are dealt with must serve the best interests of the child. This article examines the legal issues concerning relatives and the adoption of children in out-of-home care who have been legally freed for adoption. These issues include the rights of relatives to participate in the adoption proceedings of their kin, relatives' preferences in adoption decisions, and the legal rights of relatives' when children are adopted by nonrelatives. Throughout the article, the rights of grandparents will often be referred to without reference to other extended kin because in a majority of cases, it is the grandparents who are seeking the right to adopt or to maintain access to their grandchildren. The authors also discuss the principles that courts and legislatures should use in determining where relatives stand in the process of adoption of their kin. Ability to Participate in Adoption Proceeding In every state, an adoption proceeding is initiated by the filing of an adoption petition with the court [Hollinger 1988]. The parties to an adoption of children placed in the legal custody of the child welfare agency consist of the potential adoptive parents, public or private adoption agency personnel, and in a few jurisdictions, the child [Hollinger 1988]. Grandparents and other relatives are often excluded by the courts from the adoption proceedings of their kin even though they may want to crosspetition to adopt the child or maintain access to the child after the adoption by nonrelatives [Indermark 1992]. Relatives are able to participate in these proceedings only when the right to participate is conferred by statute, when the relatives demonstrate that they have a legal interest that would be unprotected and endangered by the proceeding without their participation, or when the court grants permission [Indermark 19921. …",

      "title": "Youth who \"Age Out\" of Foster Care: Troubled Lives, Troubling Prospects",
      "abstract": "O verview When children are abused, neglected, or abandoned by their parents or when parents' own difficulties (such as drug addiction, mental illness, and incarceration) leave them unable to provide adequate care, other relatives often step in.If no family members are able to take in these children, a court often places them in the care of other families or in institutions.And so, they enter the foster care system.Today, more than 500,000 children in America live in foster care -about 8 out of every 1,000 children. 1 This is a vulnerable population.Children who enter foster care have emotional, behavioral, developmental, and health problems that reflect the difficult family and environmental circumstances that caused them to be removed from their homes in the first place.Most of the children in foster care return to their families or are adopted (often by their foster parents), but not all.In 2000, more than 19,000 of the oldest children left foster care -or \"aged out\" in the parlance of child protective services -and many were pretty much on their own. 2 Usually, this happened when they turned 18. 3 If foster children, in general, are a population at risk, youth who age out of the system may be even more so.Research suggests that without the extended support most families provide young people in the transition to adulthood, youth leaving foster care face enormous challenges in building successful lives.They are less well prepared educationally, have a harder time embarking on a productive career, are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, and are more likely to be involved with the legal system.However, it is worth recalling that many of the problems evidenced by foster children have their roots in experiences that occurred before they entered the foster care system.Various strategies may be effective in reducing the number of young adults aging out of foster care, including ensuring that every child born in America is a \"wanted\" child, improving the home environments of children at risk of abuse and neglect, and accelerating the permanent placement of foster children when it is clear that their home environments pose too great a risk for them to return.And various approaches are being taken to help these vulnerable young people as they must navigate the waters of early adulthood largely on their own.Some of these approaches appear promising, but rigorous research is needed to confirm that what we think may work does, in fact, help this vulnerable population. FOSTER CARE IN THE U.S. General TrendsThe vast majority of children in the U.S. live with one or both parents -96 percent did so in 2000. 4 Yet about 1.4 million children live with neither a parent nor a grandparent.Foster children make up more than 40 percent of this group of children, with children living with other relatives or in other arrangements making up the balance.Over the past two decades, the foster care population has grown substantially.Between 1980 and 2000: 5 ■ The number of children in foster care increased from 302,000 to 556,000 (as shown in Figure 1).■ The rate of children in foster care increased from 4.7 for every 1,000 U.S. children in 1980 to 7.7 in 2000.",

      "title": "Predictors of foster father’s engagement in foster family homes",
      "abstract": "Research background: Foster fatherhood is undoubtedly a specific kind of fatherhood, since the man, often being a husband and father to his biological offspring, makes the decision to play the role of a foster father, the performance of which requires a high level of engagement in the realization of caring-rearing as well as compensatory activities, which – in turn – call for constant raising of the competences of working with an orphaned child.Research aim: To learn about the factors which condition the level of involvement of foster fathers in the realization of parenting activity in family-run children’s homes in both the global and partial dimensions.Research method: In the study, the method of diagnostic survey and that of assessment were applied.Obtained results: The analyses proved that the level of engagement of foster fathers in the realization of parenting activity in family-run children’s homes is to a large extent conditioned by foster fathers’ personality factors; to a smaller degree it is influenced by sociodemographic factors or those which are based in the system of social welfare.Conclusions: The specific nature of tasks set for a family-run children’s home demands that foster fathers should engage in the realization of parenting activity to the highest possible degree. It is thus not only important for men to be prepared to play the role of a foster father, but it is also vital to constantly support them in this role.",

      "title": "Evolutionary Perspective on the Interplay Between Family Life, and Parent and Offspring Personality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Consistent inter‐individual variation in behaviour over time and across contexts has been reported for a wide variety of animals, a phenomenon commonly referred to as personality. As behavioural patterns develop inside families, rearing conditions could have lasting effects on the expression of adult personality. In species with parental care, conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness, exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences. Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings. However, there has been little research on how personality relates to parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life.",

      "abstract": "It is a known fact that a large number of divorce/separation-affected minor children suffer from personality disorders, tendency to misconduct, substance abuse, criminal and antisocial traits, etc. Often, this is simply because non-custodial parents are denied appropriate contact, which then means their children are involved in child custody litigation due to procedural technicalities such as monthly visitation within court premises for a period as little as one or two hours, once or twice a month. Unsurprisingly, child custody litigation is based upon protecting the interests of the minor, with their welfare being the paramount consideration. However, while protecting the welfare of the minor, family courts in Pakistan often place restrictions on the minors’ enjoyment of the fundamental right of free access to one’s parents, often with no explanation.",

      "abstract": "L'objectif de ce travail est d'analyser la dimension sociale necessairement sousjacente a l'imitation a 8 et 12 mois. Le paradigme utilise consiste en une interaction a 3 : le bebe, sa mere et un etranger, ou les deux adultes se partagent les roles de demonstrateur et d'observateur. La comparaison de la mere et de l'etranger, le recours a une alternance des partenaires et a des objets plus ou moins stimulants permettent de mettre en evidence trois ordres de resultats. Les bebes accordent plus d'interets (regards et sourires) a l'etranger et ce d'autant plus lorsqu'il a le role de demonstrateur. L'alternance permet d'apprehender l'importance de l'etayage maternel et une forme de referenciation sociale. Enfin, il ressort que l'indice d'imitation reagit differemment aux variations introduites que les indices de regard et de sourire. Une absence de difference du point de vue des comportements d'imitation s'accompagne souvent d'un desequilibre dans la repartition des sourires et des regards sur la mere et sur l'etranger. Ce dernier resultat suggere les limites de la dichotomie imite/imite pas dans l'analyse des conduites d'imitation. En conclusion, nous pensons que l'apprehension du sens de l'imitation passe necessairement par une analyse de l'interaction qui lui donne corps.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adding to the literature on post-divorce parent-adolescent relationships and applying the symbolic interactionist notion of reflective appraisal, we hypothesized that being called on by one's mother for emotional assistance and being exposed to maternal concerns/worries (sensitive maternal disclosures) would be related to adolescents' feeling older than their same-aged peers (high subjective age) and engaging in greater socializing/dating. We also examined whether those associations would be moderated by age. Questionnaire data were collected from 81 adolescents whose parents were divorced. Findings offer some support for our hypothesis. Mother-to-adolescent disclosures about financial and job concerns were associated with adolescents' high subjective age; and disclosure regarding personal concerns (e.g., things that make the mother sad) was associated with adolescents' greater social involvement/dating. For younger adolescents, maternal negative disclosure about the ex-husband was associated with greater social involvement/dating. Further research is needed to determine why exposure to sensitive maternal disclosures seems to act as a catalyst for adolescents feeling older and being more socially active. Possible reasons are offered. Key Words: Adolescentssubjective agematernal disclosuresocial involvementdatingsymbolic interactionismmothersdivorceadolescentsdivorce",

      "abstract": "The study is aimed at exploring how a sample of Argentinian older women described their childhood, comparing women who showed high levels of generativity in adulthood and older age with women who showed low levels of generativity. Thirty-two volunteers over the age of 60 years (18 highly generative, 14 less generative), purposively selected according to their generative interests and activities, were interviewed and prompted to talk about their childhoods. Responses were audiotaped, transcribed, and submitted to thematic analysis. Results show how highly generative women described a generative atmosphere in their childhood. Four themes were unique to highly generative respondents, in contrast with less generative respondents: (a) a loving and protective context; (b) the assumption of responsibilities in a freedom framework; (c) the importance of playful interactions as a way of self-expansion; and (d) the inspirational role of significant others. Highly generative women described parents as combining steadfastness and affection and they are remembered as life examples who promoted successful development and the commitment to guide new generations. These themes rarely appeared in the low generativity group.",

As results of this study, we conclude:1) that the factors that affect children's choice for a place of interaction are their ages and the number of children occupying the place;2) that in the layout planning that a play ground connects Shoushas, the play ground functions for children as their locus, home base, and place of interaction with peers;3) that it shows a tendency that, when the play ground is removed from Shoushas by remodeling, children interact with their peers mainly in the hall and cafeteria of Shousha and, therefore, their interactions with children from other homes decrease.",

Por su parte, el sujeto pasivo, usualmente proviene de modos de crianza férreos, con escasa comunicación y con el uso de reglas que por su imposición sistemática ocasionan adopción de comportamientos sumisos, escasa autonomía y estima baja que le hacen propenso al ejercicio del poder de dominación, control y manipulación; con respecto al tercero observador, se asume como un sujeto distante, con bajo juicio moral, poco empático y responsable aupar el acto violento a través del desafío, de uso de palabras hirientes e instigadoras del acoso, del maltrato y el despliegue de un juego arbitrario sobre los más vulnerables.",

Sin embargo, los padres con una enfermedad mental no tratada o en situaciones de estrés continuado (casos de divorcio) pueden perder esta sensibilidad, como resultado de sus propias preocupaciones y de su necesidad de bienestar. Los trastornos de personalidad en los progenitores se manifiestan con frecuencia en coordinación parental. Se trata de un patrón persistente de experiencia interna y de comportamiento que se aparta acusadamente de las expectativas de la cultura del sujeto, es un fenómeno generalizado, estable en el tiempo y conduce a la angustia o deterioro de las relaciones interpersonales.

Most family members (56.5%) wished to become centenarians but only under specific circumstances (i.e., functional independence, good health status). Younger proxies (&lt;65 years old) were more likely to express the wish for becoming centenarians; those refuting such a desire (43.5%) stressed the potential unavailability of family support and not wanting to become a burden. No differences were found based on the centenarians’ health status. Further studies are needed on family relations within these specific caregiving dyads.",

The family investment model discusses that wealthy families are able to make significant investments in their children, whereas poor families must invest in more immediate family needs.

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the death of a grandparent in adulthood is often an expected or “on-time” life event, this loss may still result in grief for adult grandchildren. Structural aspects of relationships, including gender of the grandparent, adult grandchild, and/or middle-generation parent, may affect the response such a loss elicits from adult grandchildren. Further, adult grandchildren’s relationship quality and/or coresidence with middle-generation parents may also impact the effect of grandparent loss on adult grandchildren’s grief. Using data from Wave 2 of the Family Exchanges Study (2013), we found that (a) grandsons report less grief than granddaughters, irrespective of grandparents’ or middle-generation parents’ gender; (b) relationship quality with and worry about middle-generation parents matter most for granddaughters and those who lost a maternal grandparent; and (c) worry about middle-generation parents matters most for bereaved grandchildren who coreside with middle-generation parents. Results highlight the intersection of gender and relationship quality in a multigenerational context.",

      "title": "The specifics of speech therapy assistance in the context of migration",
      "abstract": "Currently, the changes taking place around the world are significantly intensifying population migration processes. A radical change in the usual conditions of life, which is caused by the relocation of the family to another region or country with a different language, other cultural traditions, leads to the fact that there is a disorientation of a preschool child from a migrant family, so this issue for pedagogy becomes more and more relevant. The most vulnerable in this situation are children, who represent a huge part of the migration flow. The presence of a language disorder in migrant children will significantly disrupt their adaptation and integration. Thus, it is particularly important to address the problems of educational programs, and in particular, speech therapy assistance programs for children with global language disorders. Global language disorder (pathological disorder in which all sides of language are underdeveloped: phonetic-phonematic, lexical-semantic and grammatical in the presence of preserved intellect and hearing) is a pathology frequently encountered in preschoolers, caused by various pathogenic factors of organic origin but aggravated/accentuated by psycho-social factors. In the case of migration we can see a vicious circle, the underdevelopment of language will make it difficult for these children to adapt and integrate and this will accentuate their language problems.",

      "abstract": "A mother, or any other figure serving as principal caregiver for a developing, relatively helpless infant-the case in both human and nonhuman primatesplays many roles in furthering the survival of her child. Except under rela­ tively atypical circumstances for the primates, the solitary rearing pattern of the orangutan, for example, this primary caregiving role is carried out and is shaped by the larger familial and social context in which it unfolds. The relatively cohesive, quite enduring, and largely consanguineal kinship unit and especially the mother-child relation represents a central feature for vir­ tually all aspects of primate social and affective development. These broadly significant social complements notwithstanding, a considerable range of these diverse functions is expressed in the primates.",

      "title": "Foster Youth Need Sex Ed, Too!: Addressing the Sexual Risk Behaviors of System-Involved Youth",
      "abstract": "The social, economic, and environmental determinants of health include employment, housing, and education; exposure to environmental factors like lead or access to healthy food; and poverty, racism and oppression. Many of these conditions can lead to Adverse Childhood Experiences that may put children and youth at risk for abuse or maltreatment leading to involvement in the child welfare or juvenile justice systems. All young people experience important developmental milestones on their path to becoming healthy adults, and while this time of change is full of promise, it can be a time of increased vulnerability or risk. For system-involved youth, navigating this time of change can be fraught with even more challenges or barriers. Without strong family and social networks, they may face increased risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors—such as unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners—as well as unintended pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. Our study examined survey data to assess the overall sexual reproductive health behaviors for youth aged 14–21 in out-of-home care in an urban environment (n = 270; 60.7% male; 82% African American; 7.9% Latinx). Youth were recruited between 2012 and 2016; 76.4% of these teens had had sexual intercourse at some point in their lifetime. Of these, 86.0% were sexually active before the age of 16. Although there were numerous risk factors related to contraception and condom use as well as partner demographics, there were assets or strengths identified. A discussion of how these findings can be utilized to develop effective prevention intervention strategies is provided.",

Guided by symbolic interaction theory, we examined how adolescent gender, ethnicity, family structure, and depressive symptoms explained attributions for residential father behavior. A total of 382 adolescents, grouped by ethnicity (European American, Mexican American) and family structure (intact, stepfamilies), reported attributions for their fathers’ positive and negative behaviors. Results indicated that for positive events, girls made significantly more stable attributions, whereas boys made more unstable attributions. Mexican American adolescents tended to make more unstable attributions for positive events than European Americans, and adolescents from intact families made more stable attributions for positive events than adolescents from stepfamilies. Implications are discussed for the role of attributions in father–adolescent relationships as prime for intervention in families.",

Points of convergence and divergence between the models are discussed and empirically examined in a sample of 72 nondivorced and 56 stepfather families. A multirater, multimethod design was used to model effects of family relationships on adolescent social competence, cognitive agency, and externalizing behavior. The major findings were that (a) adolescent → parent behavior was as robust as parent → adolescent behavior in predicting adolescent adjustment; (b) family relations were less coherent or connected in stepfamilies compared to nondivorced; and (c) the configuration of family relationships moderated the effect of a specific relationship on adolescent adjustment. We discuss the implications for how family systems theory qualifies and extends bidirectional models and how contextual influences, especially family type, modify bidirectional and systems models of relationships.",

      "abstract": "Conflict is a problem, a dispute that occurs between one individual and another. Conflict itself occurs in many issues, such as households, families, children and parents, siblings and so on. Domestic life inevitably requires a change in lifestyle, adjusting to the demands of responsibility, understanding the characteristics of new people around them, and establishing good relationships between spouses. The main causes of domestic conflict include: (1) Ineffective Communication, (2) Different Values and Views, (3) Financial Issues, (4) Roles and Responsibilities, (5) Interpersonal Issues, (6) Family Crisis, (7) Life Stress. Children affected by their parents' domestic conflict can experience a range of serious mental health problems. Household conflict can make them feel isolated and lack emotional support, which can worsen their depression. Based on interviews that have been conducted most of those affected or affected by domestic conflict in their parents will become more aggressive, prone to tantrums, or withdraw from their social environment. The purpose of this study is to determine how parental conflict affects children's mental health. As well as the impact that occurs on mental health in children due to parental household conflict. This research was conducted using the interview method with informants who have been determined. In this study, researchers used a qualitative approach to analyze the data. In addition, other data collection techniques used in this study are observation, and documentation. The conclusion in this study is that children who are raised in families that experience a lot of conflict tend to have lower social skills, emotional development, and adaptability than children their age. The result can develop into anxiety disorders, low self-esteem, inability to interact, and denial.",

Adolescent and young adult twins and their siblings (N = 628) completed the Parental Bonding Instrument and a six-day Experience Sampling period to gather information on their daily-life social interactions. Higher overall parental bonding quality related to more positive social experiences in daily life, but not to different levels of social behaviors. Relative to maternal dimensions, paternal dimensions were uniquely predictive of better subjective social experiences. These findings demonstrate that specific aspects of parental bonding have unique effects upon how adolescents experience their social world, thereby making the idea of socialization through parenting relevant at the level of daily life.",

Hal ini berkaitan dengan keinginan orang tua untuk mempunyai anak. Ayah sebagai orang tua tunggal yang memang menginginkan anak laki-Iaki akan mampu memberikan pengasuhan yang positif ketika mendapatkan anak laki-laki.\r\n2.\r\nKedekatan orang tua dengan anak.

      "abstract": "Abstract The term “empty nest” is commonly used to refer to the situation where children have grown up and left the parental home. This situation may involve a reorganization of parental roles and is commonly assumed to create a related condition known as the empty nest syndrome, which is purported to affect mothers more than fathers. Historically, the empty nest phase of the family life cycle was relatively rare or of short duration. With increased longevity and lower fertility rates, parents began to expect an extended postparental and postretirement period. In contemporary times, the transition to the empty nest is less linear or permanent since many young adult children return home. This countertrend of refilled nests is largely attributed to economic and other sociodemographic shifts which have delayed the independence of young adults in addition to other family transitions over the life course. Cross‐cultural and other studies also highlight diversity in empty nest experiences by psychological and relational factors, ethnic background, social class, gender, and regional locale.",

      "abstract": "This study examines parental perceptions of the importance of grandparents as providers of routine care to children with disabilities and the impact of such assistance on parental well-being. Data are drawn from a survey and follow-up interactive interviews. Findings of the survey indicate that: 1) grandparents are a common source of weekly assistance—significantly more common than other relatives or friends and neighbors; 2) where grandparents participate, the number of other sources of support is also higher; and 3) help from grandparents has a positive, while the number of other sources of help has a negative, relationship to parental ability to maintain a positive emotional outlook and to avoid physical exhaustion. Findings of the interactive interviews suggest that: 1) grandparent participation can promote pride and “normalized attitudes” by helping grandparents to get to know the child with a disability on an intimate basis; 2) when grandparents do not participate, parents may feel the need to manage the information given to and the emotional responses experienced by grandparents who have not had a chance to get know and love the child through frequent, direct contact; and 3) parents are very concerned that if grandparents themselves begin to need help due to increased age and disability, they will not ask for it because of fear that parents are already overburdened by the unusual demands of their parenting roles.",

      "title": "Time for care: exploring time use by carers of older people",
      "abstract": "Abstract The paper focuses on temporal aspects of informal caring for older people. Limitations of large-scale surveys in capturing such data are noted and time-use methodology, despite its own limitations, is proposed as a promising alternative. Adopting a critical perspective on time that includes carers’ own conceptualisations, we report the findings of a qualitative study of carers’ time use. Sixty-two interviews with carers, male/female, co-resident/not co-resident, employed/not employed, and located across Great Britain were conducted. Analysis considered people's own diverse and ambiguous views of their care activities. Carers’ accounts of their time revealed non-linear experiences and a sense of being permanently on call. Interviewees often travelled distances to engage in support activities with or for older people. Changes over time were pervasive, increasing or reducing care requirements. Unanticipated events could precipitate radical changes in time use. Managing time, exercising temporal agency, was particularly apparent in accounts of care, employment, other family responsibilities and choices about friendship. Measurement of carers’ time use which draws on the conceptual foundation of carers’ own perspectives on time may provide more effective quantitative understanding of the temporal aspects of caring. It should not pre-define time, must grasp a variety of tasks, take account of intermittent activity, incorporate the 24–7 experience of many carers and demonstrate how caring time interacts with other time.",

      "abstract": "Trajectories of perceived support from family, friends, and lovers were examined in 923 high school seniors surveyed across the transition to adulthood (ages 18, 19, 20, 22, and 25). Growth models revealed a cubic pattern of support from family members, which peaked at age 20, no change in friend support, and a linear decrease in lover support. Women reported higher levels of support than did men for all sources except fathers. Over time, friend and lover support decreased for women but increased for men. Both mother and father support were higher among young people who had left home, and cohabitation/marriage was associated with lower friend support and higher lover support. Support in close social relationships in the early 20s is dynamic; personal characteristics (e.g., gender) and life course transitions such as leaving home and marriage contribute to changing levels of perceived support.",

      "abstract": "ACROSS HISTORY AND CULTURAL SETTINGS, children and adolescents have spent time alone as a result of daily practices (e.g., sleeping arrangements; Latz, Wolf, & Lozoff, 1999) and to mark important transitions towards full community involvement. Among the Chimbu of Papua New Guinea and the Nharo people of Botswana, for example, female initiation rites have involved the isolation of the pubescent girl in a hut for days or weeks, during which she is instructed in proper behavior (Barnard, 1980; Ross, 1965). Whereas sometimes time alone has been found to be a source of creativity, wisdom, and learning, at other times it hasbeen linked to isolation, abandonment, and exclusion. In both industrialized and nonindustrialized countries, many children spend time home alone on a regular basis before or after school or on weekends (Ruiz-Casares & Heymann, 2009; Vandell & Posner, 1999). Various contributing factors (e.g., parents' availability, children's age and perceived risk) and negative outcomes linked to longer periods of time in self-care have been identified (Colwell, Pettit, Meece, Bates, & Dodge, 2001; Vandivere, Tour, Zaslow, Calkins, & Capizzano, 2003). Despite initial evidence that many children and adolescents experience loneliness when they are home alone or living in isolated areas (Cummins, 2009; Ruiz-Casares &Rousseau, 2010), little attention has been paid to date to their experiences of aloneness when in self-care.",

      "title": "Abuso su minori in contesti istituzionali a carattere religioso: la parola agli operatori",
      "abstract": "I criminologi si trovano sempre più spesso ad affrontare la problematica relati-va al verificarsi di abusi e maltrattamenti su minori. Tale questione, però, risulta difficilmente indagabile per via della natura fragile delle vittime e per i contesti in cui solitamente si verificano questi eventi e cioè gli ambienti familiari o quelli a ca-rattere istituzionale (come scuole, centri ricreativi e sportivi, strutture ecclesiastiche). Negli ultimi anni alcuni scandali relativi ad abusi perpetrati nei confronti dei minori all'interno di organizzazioni religiose e/o di ispirazione religiosa hanno de-stato l'interesse dell'opinione pubblica angloamericana, ma non solo. Questo particolare tipo di contesto in cui vengono perpetrati tali abusi su minori conduce a dover affrontare la questione sotto molteplici aspetti. Difatti, in deter-minati ambienti, molti fattori concorrono a rendere difficoltosa l'individuazione dell'abuso che risulta, per questo motivo, estremamente sottostimato. Il presente articolo, grazie alle informazioni ricavate da interviste semi-strutturate e focus group effettuati con criminologi, operatori del controllo sociale, educatori ed assistenti sociali nell'ambito della ricerca europea \"SAFE - Suppor-ting Action to Foster Embedding of child safeguarding policies in Italian faith led organizations and sports club for children\" (grant agreement n° 856807), si concentrerà sulla problematica degli abusi sui minori in organizzazioni religiose e/o di ispirazione religiosa con il fine di raccogliere nuovi elementi sul fenomeno, carat-terizzato da un elevato numero oscuro, e di proporre strategie d'intervento per la prevenzione della vittimizzazione. La partecipazione allo studio di testimoni signi-ficativi impreziosisce la pertinenza dell'approccio qualitativo proposto ed è utile per mettere in evidenza una questione scarsamente trattata dalla ricerca socio-criminologica italiana.",

Oleh karena itu peran, sikap dan perilaku orangtua dalam proses pengasuhan anak, sangat besar pengaruhnya dalam pembentukan dan perkembangan kepribadian anak. Dengan kehadiran seorang anak dalam keluarga, komunikasi dalam keluarga menjadi lebih penting dan intensitasnya harus semakin meningkat, artinya dalam keluarga perlu ada komunikasi yang baik dan sesering mungkin antara orang tua dengan anak. Cukup banyak persoalan yang timbul di masyarakat karena atau tidak adanya komunikasi yang baik dalam keluarga. Dalam kenyataannya, proses interaksi anak dengan orangtua tidak selalu sesuai dengan yang diharapkan dan tidaklah sesederhana yang kita bayangkan dan katakan. Pengasuhan sering dibumbui oleh berbagai hal yang tidak mendukung bagi kemandirian anak, antara lain: sikap dan perilaku orangtua yang tidak dapat menjadi contoh bagi anak-anaknya, suasana emosi anggota rumah tangga sehari-hari yang tidak kondusif, serta interaksi anggota keluarga lainnya yang tidak baik. Dengan situasi seperti itu, maka tidak semua interaksi keluarga terhadap anak efektif, akibatnya, perilaku dan kemandirian anak, tidak sesuai dengan yang diharapkan. Faktor lingkungan, seperti kemajuan teknologi informasi dan globalisasi yang berkembang pesat dewasa ini sangat mempengaruhi nilai dan norma yang berlaku dalam individu, keluarga, dan masyarakat. Hal ini dapat berakibat terjadinya berbagai permasalahan sosial pada anak diantaranya; penyimpangan perilaku baik pada anak maupun pada orang dewasa, seperti tindak kekerasan, pencurian, pelecehan seksual, tawuran dan lain- lain yang menyebabkan anak berhadapan dengan hukum (ABH).",

Les situations expérimentales consistent principalement à présenter à chaque enfant trois sortes de cibles-stimuli : un ensemble d’objets, un autre enfant de même âge, un adulte connu par l’enfant. Les enfants du groupe A fournissent les réactions les plus intenses à la présentation des objets. Ceux du groupe B réagissent surtout au stimulus adulte connu. Ce résultat paraît contredire la théorie du conditionnement selon laquelle l’activité de l’enfant se différencie progressivement en fonction de la satisfaction de ses besoins biologiques élémentaires. Or ce sont les enfants les moins satisfaits (les orphelins en institution) qui se distinguent par leurs réactions plus intenses à la présence de l’adulte. L’auteur rend compte de ce paradoxe apparent par le recours aux deux notions de schème fonctionnel et d’entropie. La réaction des orphelins serait le symptôme d’une contre-réaction active à la dégradation (entropie positive) de schèmes fonctionnels concernant l’apport social du milieu.",

      "abstract": "Severe congenital impairments in one child will affect the whole family, possibly for a generation if the child remains at home as an adult. Disability acquired in adult life will affect both partners as roles are gained or relinquished. For children this may result in a loss of parenting. The adjustment process to any psychological or personality changes may be very painful, particularly if children have no one outside the family to provide informed support. Acquired illness or disability in children may have enormous consequences for siblings, the health of the parents and the whole fabric of family life, often resulting in family isolation. In some Asian families, the feeling that the extended family unit is self sufficient and able to provide care may conflict with the ideal of increasing independence fostered by the professionals, and limit the possibility of support from social workers or psychologists. The extended family may reduce the need for statutory support. The expectation that care will be provided to old people by their daughters or daughters-in-law may be frustrated if the younger generation of women are disabled or otherwise engaged, resulting in possible family strife or rejection.",

      "title": "The implications of today's family structures for support giving to older parents",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT There is considerable debate about the effects of today's family structures on support arrangements for older people. Using representative data from The Netherlands, the study reported in this paper investigates which socio-demographic characteristics of adult children and their elderly parents, and which motivations of the adult children, correlate with children giving practical and social support to their parents. The findings indicate that the strongest socio-demographic correlates of a higher likelihood of giving support were: having few siblings, having a widowed parent without a new partner and, for practical support, a short geographical distance between the parent's and child's homes. Single mothers were more likely to receive support than mothers with partners, irrespective of whether their situation followed divorce or widowhood. Widowed fathers also received more support, but only with housework. A good parent-child relationship was the most important motivator for giving support, whereas subscribing to filial obligation norms was a much weaker motivator, especially for social support. Insofar as demographic and cultural changes in family structures predict a lower likelihood of support from children to elderly parents, this applies to practical support, and derives mainly from increased geographical separation distances and from the growing trend for parents to take new partners. Social support is unlikely to be affected by these changes if parents and children maintain good relationships.",

Research has not, however, accounted for Americans’ increasingly diverse and complex marital and family histories with respect to caregiving related decision making. This paper presents findings from a mixed methods study of late-life remarried spouses (n=36) providing care for a partner with dementia. Grounded in family systems and life course theories, this study examines remarried caregivers’ expectations and experiences of engagement in decision making by adult children and stepchildren. Findings indicate a range of decision making dynamics across stepfamily members, including: collaborative, selective, divested, and disruptive. Collaboration was more common in response to arranging care assistance, while disruptive interactions commonly surfaced in response to financial decision making. Implications of how intergenerational relationship history and quality shape decision making support in late life stepfamilies will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "THE AIM OF THIS PAPER is to unpack the implicit ideology underpinning early childhood service delivery for families living with childhood disability. The family as the unit of care is central to the philosophy and practice of early childhood services. However, the practice of family-centred care can be problematic; it is based upon neo-liberal assumptions of ‘idealised’ families, underestimates the profound impact of childhood disability on the family, and encourages service providers to conflate parents' involvement in care with responsibility for it. Further, the notion of chronic sorrow is often applied in order to describe parents and/or families as either ‘in denial’ or too aggrieved to enact their therapeutic imperative, and individualised and psychologised interpretations are made. Service delivery in early childhood settings often reinforces - rather than acts to reduce-social, cultural and economic injustices. Clearly then, childhood disability remains institutionalised, but just within the institution of the family. Attention to the largely silenced, yet multiple, shifting, and complex issues faced by families living with childhood disability is required and will likely have implications for early childhood service delivery.",

The reason why children in foster care develop secure attachement si family environment, which children who grow up in children's homes are less likely to achieve. A lot of educators, their frequently changed, age when children come in alternative care are just one of risk to develop a insecure attachement.

Three implicit hypotheses in much of the past research on parenting stress and behavior are evaluated: (a) parenting stress is causally related to poor parenting, (b) poor parenting is causally related to problems in child adjustment, and (c) parenting behavior mediates the associations between parenting stress and child adjustment. In addition, three questions for future research regarding within-family and within-Individual variation in parenting stress are raised: (a) Is parenting stress genetically influenced? (b) Do mothers and fathers show similar or different levels of parenting stress? (c) Is parenting stress “child specific” within families?",

      "abstract": "One of the most difficult times for family carers is when the person they care for moves into a residential care home. Although they are relieved to some extent of the day-to-day tasks of caring, they lose the company of their loved one, which can be especially difficult for spouse carers. It is not always easy to obtain residential placement near to the carer's home, so carers may have to travel some distance to see the person they care for, which they often do on a daily basis. Furthermore, they lose control of the care provided, including the perceived quality of that care. They may also lose services, such as home care, or benefits, such as carer payments, that they were receiving on behalf of the person they were caring for or due to their caring responsibilities. These issues are often poorly recognized and managed in a service system that focuses more on the instrumental rather than emotional and social aspects of care for older people. It is often thought that residential care placement signifies the end of the caring role. However, qualitative research in this area highlights that family care is not relinquished when the cared for person goes into residential care and this is clearly demonstrated in the review of the qualitative literature by Afram and colleagues in this issue.",

      "title": "Fathers as caregivers",
      "abstract": "SynopsisIt is traditionally thought that mothers are better equipped than fathers to care for children. A major interview study of Australian fathers and mothers, however, revealed that a significant minority of parents have life-styles inconsistent with this belief; in these families, fathers and mothers share the caregiving equally, or nearly equally. The focus of this paper is on 23 of these shared-role families. Data are presented on: work and family life, divisions of labour, beliefs about parental roles, other people's reactions to their life-styles, problems encountered in changing caregiving patterns, and parental perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of sharing caregiving. The findings show that fathers are competent caregivers, and it is argued that there is no reason why this shared-role pattern should not become an accepted and viable alternative family life-style. For this to occur, however, changes are necessary at both structural (for example, more job flexibility) and personal levels (for example, changes in beliefs about parental roles and the needs of children).",

Development unfolds in an ecologic and a social setting which, just like the genes, is decisive in shaping the organism. The social niche is a crucial link between parents and offspring, an envelope of life chances. It is high time to replace the false dichotomy between nature versus nurture by a more inclusive trio: nature, niche, and nurture. Major brain pathways are specified in the genome, but the learned connections between brain and behavior are fashioned by social experience. The luxuriant overgrowth of neurons and their processes in embryonic and early life provides the substrate for environmentally induced structural change. Activity selects out the synapses that will persist; inactivity results in regression and apoptosis. Learning begins in utero and accelerates after birth. Responsive interactions between infants, their parents, and other caretakers is crucial to biological no less than psychosocial development. Comprehensive pediatric care can help provide a head start to enhance brain development and put the mind on the road to adaptive maturity.",

For sure that the family has changed, that its constitutional protection was increased as well as the child and the teenager, here represented by the son, receives integral protection. The rights of the children and the duties of the parents can’t be forgotten, but in a contextual zed way, as in the case, in the environment of conjugal dissolution of the corporation, environment of rupture in which the conflict and the dispute are incited. The parents do not understand themselves and the children are displayed to a series of situations that can generate psychological shock that can last for a long time. The applied civil liability in the family law doesn’t get by the legal devices to happen on the father’s behavior to determine as illicit; in the same way, consequently, it doesn’t get the causality nexus because it isn’t possible to point as an only behavior the production of damage. Fact is that the demands with decision of definitive origin do not satisfy the son because the psychological damage isn’t restored; on the contrary, it is aggravated, since the family relation of affection won’t exist for the account of the definitive rupture between father and son. One of the alternatives for the familiar conflicts is the mediation where father and son have the possibility of forgetting the past, focuses the future and restores the relation of familiar affection.",

      "abstract": "Fear in reaction to danger potentially leads to life-saving \"fight or flight.\" Anxiety is intrinsic to fear, and the young infant experiences anxiety during the earliest inevitable separations from caretakers. Over time, a child learns to experience anxiety in anticipation of fear, whether this fear is based on a true impending danger or a separation (eg, being left to fall asleep at bedtime). Bowlby, recognizing the infant's life and death dependency on a caretaker, defined separation as the \"basic anxiety of infancy.\" The mother's leaving is so potentially dangerous that the infant responds with a piercing cry that reflects both protest and anxiety while calling forth the mother's return. This cry is a paradigm for what we all face when we experience the inevitable losses of loved ones or even our own hopes. Anxiety secondary to separation can continue beyond the expected age and interfere with a child's ability to function. Separation anxiety disorder may prevent a child from achieving critical developmental milestones, such as leaving his or her parent to play with friends or go to school. The early recognition of unwarranted or excessive separation anxiety may help limit potentially serious dysfunction. Separation anxiety can be expected to begin to ease for most children at 18 months of age with the cognitive mastery of object permanence and the growing security of consistent caretaking.",

      "title": "Microeconomic models of family transfers",
      "abstract": "Standard homo economicus lives in a world of complete markets and maximizes utility which is a function of his personal consumption. This approximation cannot account for parents making transfers to adult children, children taking care of old parents, nor for gifts, inheritance and many other services exchanged within families. Such behavior can be derived from three main mechanisms. Firstly, in the so-called pure altruism model, the parent's utility is augmented by the utility of his child. This leads to transfers from the parent to his child. An important feature of this model is the strong property of redistributive neutrality: since parents and child pool their income, any government transfer to one will be undone by the other adjusting his transfer. In a second model, altruism is impure as the parents want the child to behave in a certain way: exchange and strategic considerations enter the picture, as both parents' and child's income become endogenous. Thirdly, in a non-altruistic setting, with imperfect credit market, transfers to children and to old parents correspond to a reciprocity contract and are an investment for old age. Families embody long term and widespread commitments: born as a needy child, one becomes a parent and ultimately a (perhaps) needy grandparent. Moreover for much of what is exchanged within families, there is no market substitute. These features explain why the network of reciprocities can be large both in time and space, why those transfers change but do not disappear as market or public insurance develop, and why displacing them can have perverse side effects. Family transfers influence intra- and inter-generational inequality, hence the importance to assess their motivation. Tests usually conclude that the income pooling predicted by pure altruism is not observed, but family transfers are also far from being entirely motivated by direct exchange considerations.",

The extensive-personality predisposition comprises emotionally healthy attachment to family and the inclusion of others as deserving of care.

      "title": "REASONS OF CONFLICTS OF SENIOR PUPILS WITH THEIR PARENTS:TO THE PROBLEM OF FAMILY ADAPTATION",
      "abstract": "The psychological determinants for the formation of harmonious family relationships were highlighted: empathically oriented communication, humanistic style of children’s upbringing, their high level of self-esteem, smoothing the difference between “Me-ideal” and “Me-real”, positive attitude from others and self-respect. Based on the results of our observations, which we carried out in 2021 in the educational process of educational activities of secondary schools № 15 of t. Rivne, we can exactly conclude that for senior school age is quite characterized of emotional fluctuations in mood. Some pupils were also characterized (in some cases) by neurotic and protest, sometimes by aggressive behavior, but these were isolated cases. We have diagnosed that tense situations are arisen between parents and children from time to time. However, again, our observations show that maladaptive family relationships are never caused by a single cause. For example, parents’ sexual problems have never been the predominant cause of maladaptive family relationships between parents and children, but aggressive tendencies caused by parents’ sexual problems often exacerbate children’s nervous and aggressive disputes with their parents. And even if young people find a way out of these disputes in some a way, in any case, the attitude towards parents remains negative, as, incidentally, the attitude of parents towards children (hair, clothes, hobbies, leisure, etc.). We identify as the most important topics of conflict of schoolchildren such as: - young people want to communicate, above all, with their peers, to defend their own interests and have weak parental control; - compared to adolescence, the importance of hairstyles and clothes increases significantly among high school students (the conflict is caused by the mismatch between the standards of high school students and the generation of parents). For high school students, the style of hair and clothing were associated with the relevant youth subculture, which was partly seen as some “message” of the adult world; - disagreements with parents and conflict situations on eroticism and sex occur at the age of 12-16, much earlier than in previous generations; - the time spent by high school students at school has been increased significantly. Conflicts between high school students and their parents about schooling are inaccuracies in homework, low school performances, and, at the same time, senior pupils do not have enough time to help their parents with household chores. However, the most important causes of family conflicts are children’s smoking and their use of psychoactive substances. The latter more often there were aggravating relationships between boys and their parents (57% of male pupils and 32% of female ones). There are almost no differences between boys and girls when it comes to smoking (32% of pupils are male and 30% of them are female), and other problems are more common among girls. Senior pupils name the following causes of conflicts with their parents: - great differences in moral and value frames, attitudes and scripts of children and adults, especially in the period of personal growth (parents and children are also diagnosed with differences in personal experience, perception of the world, assessments of their own ethnic and national identity); - lack of clear, consistent boundaries of the transition from awareness of child dependence to the freedom of an adult; - lack of clear, consistent rules for parents to build family relationships, which significantly weaken parental power during the transition of children from childhood to adolescence; - psychological and social differences in characteristics between parents and children. Pupils explain the latter with different ideas of schoolchildren about themselves, their own future, the formation of personally and professionally significant experience of adults. The latter also laments the children’s lack of perception of the evaluative and control role of adults in relations to the needs of pupils in achieving sovereignty; - mental overload of both parents and children and, as a result, – a change in scenarios and scenarios plans of family relationships.",

Earlier studies emphasized the negative effects of parental divorce on the development of children and adolescents. Due to historic changes in family structure, however, parental divorce has to be conceptualized in more positive terms. In the study presented, idealization of the non-custodial father was only found in a clinical subsample of adolescents, whereas the father-adolescent relationship in non-clinical adolescents from divorced families did not differ significantly from the quality of relationship described by non-clinical adolescents living in two-parent families. The function of idealization in coping with negative affects such as aggression and affliction is discussed, in particular for those adolescents in the clinical sample who rarely have contact with their non-custodial fathers, and the contributions of fathers to hold up this idealization outlined. Idealistic conceptions in adolescents of divorced parents are especially problematic, since adolescents are expected to become disengaged of their parents and develop a mature and realistic perception of them.",

Article brings up these issues focusing on the danger of stereotyping on ageing. Features of social vulnerability are highlighted in specific contexts, including that of migration. We are concluding on aging as an individual process, underpinned by different lifestyles, various personal and social problems of older persons, their expectations and the solutions proposed.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines the opinions of Spanish older people regarding the ideal living situation in later life – living in their own home, co-residing in a relative's home or institutionalisation – differentiating between two hypothetical situations: healthy ageing and frailty. Data are drawn from the Instituto de Mayores y Servicios Sociales (Institute of Older People and Social Services; IMSERSO) survey Encuesta de Mayores 2010 (Older People Survey 2010), comprising 2,535 individuals aged 65 and over living in private dwellings. The results confirm that residential preferences vary depending on expected health conditions. Remaining in one's own home is preferred when older people foresee a healthy old age, whilst co-residence at a relative's home turns into the favoured solution if older people have to face some physical or cognitive limitation. The particularities of the Spanish context regarding family-oriented values about care responsibilities and the structural deficiency in the provision of formal support, in addition to other socio-demographic, psychological and attitudinal aspects, were explanatory factors of the lower desirability for ageing at home in the case of frailty. The findings question the uniform image of ‘ageing in place’ as a preference, inviting reflections on the need to distinguish between later-life stages and national contexts.",

      "title": "“Personal relationship is really the backbone of everything”: Exploring professionals’ perceptions on the relationships of transition-age youth in foster care",
      "abstract": "Social and personal relationships are critical for transition-age youth (TAY) as they transition out of foster care to adulthood. Youth in foster care experience more challenges as they approach adulthood as a result of previous child maltreatment and lack of social support and resources compared to their peers. TAY with stable and supportive relationships exhibit improved emerging adulthood outcomes, including mental health, education, employment, and housing stability. Child welfare professionals play an important role as they facilitate this transition process through interacting with different stakeholders, including TAY, birth parents, foster parents, and service providers. This study explored the perspectives of child welfare workers and other professionals working with older youth and young adults with foster care experience. This qualitative study included 19 participants who had worked with youth in foster care aged 14 years and older and had worked in this field for over one year. Three themes were identified across the interviews: (1) navigating social and personal relationships during the transition out of foster care, (2) things did not go as hoped as TAY reconnected with family of origin, and (3) the roles of supportive relationships on TAY’s mental health. Findings from this study have several implications on cultivating and enhancing supportive relationships of TAY with foster care experience.",

      "abstract": "노인의 경우 저하되는 물리적 인지적 기능 때문에 활동 반경이 줄어들어 가까운 주변 환경에 더 많이 영향을 받는다. 또한, 사회적 네트워크에 있어서도 넓은 인간관계보다는 감정을 서로 교류하는 친밀한 작은 네트워크를 선호하는 경향이 있다. 그러므로 노인들에게 있어서 집 주변의 이웃과 그 환경은 잠재적으로 활용될 수 있는 사회활동 기회이다. 본 연구에서는 주거지역에서 99명의 노인들을 9개월동안 인터뷰하면서 노인들의 이웃과의 유대와 주거시설의 특징을 조사하였다. 아파트가 아닌 저층 주거지역에서 노인들 간에 더 강한 유대를 가지고 있는 것으로 확인 되었다. 한 가지 중요한 발견은 노인들 간의 사회적 교류가 친하게 지내는 것만으로 끝나는 것이 아니라 서로 도움을 주는 관계라는 것이다. 예를 들어, 노인들은 모이는 장소를 선택 할 때 다리가 아파서 걷기 힘든 노인의 집 앞에서 모인다. 이것은 노인학 이론에서 쇠퇴하는 기능에 적응해가는 과정을 보여주는 선택, 최적화, 보완으로 설명되어 질 수 있다. 노인들은 많은 장소 중에 다리가 아픈 노인의 집앞을 선택했고 이것은 모이는 활동을 최적화하고 이동의 제한을 노인 공동체로서 보완하게 되는 것이다. 이러한 적응 과정은 저층주거지역에서 모이는 장소를 자유롭게 선택하면서 용이하게 일어날 수 있는 환경이 갖추어져 있는 것으로 보이며 인터뷰의 결과에서도 저층주거지역에서의 노인들이 고층보다 더 유의미하게 많이 서로 금전이나 어려운 집안일을 논의 하는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과에 잠재적으로 영향을 줄 수 있는 물리적 조건을 조사하였다.",

      "abstract": "Family violence includes violence that occurs between family members- parents, intimate partners, siblings or family members of multiple generations, and grandparents. Witnessing family violence refers to situations in which a child witnesses frequent and prolonged verbal or physical violence between parents or other family members. Family violence is considered to be all threatening, coercive or controlling actions used by one family member towards another. Family violence may occur between two or several family members, but it inevitably affects all members of that family. Although child abuse and domestic violence are separated as forms of violence, it is important to point out that they are usually not mutually exclusive. Therefore, a child should be considered a victim, even if he is not the primary victim, when he hears or witnesses constant arguments or physical violence between parents or other family members. In these situations, it is considered that the child is experiencing mental or emotional abuse, which is why he has an increased risk of becoming violent himself. In addition, both the child and the adult may hold themselves responsible for the violent behavior, especially if the perpetrator of the violent behavior convinces them of this. Given that they are in a situation that requires the help of other people, and because of their own responsibility that they feel even though it does not exist, health and psychological difficulties or an anxiety disorder may appear that greatly disrupt the daily life of people who experience violence and thus prevent them from working what they would like.",

Thus, the way the family function, the relationships that exist between family members, the size of the family, but also the circumstances in which family lives (especially economic circumstances) can further deepen or emphasize the negative individual characteristics of children. The upbringing style, the lack of attention, parental rejection, parental indulgence, negligence, the violent behavior in the home (physical and verbal aggression between parents and parent towards a child), increases the likelihood of negative behavior in children. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, based on a research review on child aggressive behavior, it has been concluded that the absence of a father, loss of a parent through divorce or death are factors that also can be associated with childhood aggression. Among the important family factors that will also be analyzed in this paper are the presence of alcoholism, criminal, and aggressive behavior in the family.",

Adults in stepfamilies may try to maintain a large number of family ties originating from various partnerships, or they may limit the recognition of their family to the members of their new household. Children, on the other hand, are encouraged to maintain contact with both parents and their relatives. Family descriptions of 48 re-partnered mothers residing in Switzerland, as well as their current partners and children, are analysed by focusing on exclusiveness and inclusiveness in written or drawn descriptions. Descriptions collected in family interviews follow a balance of social tensions among interdependent individuals by which responses of children usually match those of their mothers. Mothers’ responses show a high level of exclusiveness, whereas responses of mothers’ partners and children are more balanced between exclusivity and inclusivity. Inclusiveness in families after re-partnering is also connected to conditions such as family structure, mothers’ education and employment.",

They may seem to fit with a family model or develop very different kinds of organizational behaviour. Different systems of care attempt to locate themselves at different points of the cycle—for example, claiming to be the \"end of the line\" even when they are not—and they are always likely to be caught out by the every-changing needs that they are facing. The NHS has experienced a succession of change initiatives. It seems a different age since we were saying to clinicians that they were managers— before the introduction of general managers, and then of ever more insistent and emotionally detached external systems of audit and control. There may be negotiated agreements to manage such boundary expectations between formal and informal systems of care.",

Most of the existing and proposed policies encourage children’s biological parents to remain together to raise their children or at least to work closely together to raise the children after they break up. Two major longitudinal studies of families from before or at the time children were born provide support for such policies in some, but not all circumstances; instead of being one-size-fits-all, policies should allow for variation in relationships and be sensitive to the views of parents caring for children about what is best for their families. This Article describes the major findings of these longitudinal studies, and then examines some recent proposals that respond to the studies, arguing that the proposals may promote relationships that are unhealthy for the adults or children. It concludes with suggested policies that are more sensitive to the variability in families.",

In the current model the degree to which adolescents and young adults felt caught between their parents was tested as a mediator between divorce and children's avoidance and satisfaction with them. The results revealed that divorce was largely associated with avoidance and satisfaction through children's feelings of being caught, which were a function of their parents' demand—withdraw patterns, communication competence, and other variables. When divorce was removed from the model, the specific relationships in the model applied to children of divorced and non-divorced households. Nevertheless, children of divorce reported greater avoidance, feelings of being caught, greater parental demand—withdraw patterns, less parental communication competence, less closeness, and less satisfaction than children from first marriage families. The. t of the model as a function of the age of the child is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The physically challenged children are frequently characterized by extremes of behaviors, which in some cases influence the interactions they have with parents and siblings. The extra care and accommodations are required by them. Parenting is the job with no preparations and vacations. Children with disabilities have needs that require more attention, greater vigilance and effort from parents than nondisabled children. Though the presence of a physically challenged child need not create a family crisis, the stigma of disability imposed by the society can be offending to the parents and the family. Disability in a child provokes a series of disequilibrium among the parents in their psychological aspects which directly or indirectly affect them in various social and psychological well beings. Parents show a series of reactions after knowing that their child is disabled and they start showing the guilt, sorrow, denial, anger, which affects different parents differently, so that these sort of stressors leads the parents to physical and mental health problem. There is abundant evidence that parents of disabled children undergo more than average amount of stress. Parents of disabled children have very high level of parenting stress signifying that they perceived for more stress in their role as parents than did parents of children without disabilities. The nature of stress has been shown to span over several aspects of family life such as daily care demands, emotional distress, interpersonal difficulties, financial problems and adverse social consequences. Psychosocial issues of parents and children with disabilities can be very traumatic for most parents. The parents of the child with disability need to be stronger, adaptive, and optimistic and have a huge sense of humour. They have to be special for the child. The counselling and guidance is required for the parents suffering with physical and mental health problem. The extreme problem",

Parental support will help to overcome the refusal of infants and young children lacking in discernment. With older children the refusal must be considered within the child’s relational system (his parents, the doctors, the illness). The adolescent confronts us with our limits when the capacity for discernment is present and care is refused: there are many motivations for the refusal and they must be carefully evaluated, while leaving room for the hypothesis that the form of care proposed is not in fact pertinent. Very often, the refusal of care is an invitation to a constructive dialogue with the child and his/her parents during which an attempt will be made both to preserve the child’s health and to give value to what he/she has to say.",

At the same time, disabled children often live in families who belong to social categories that are associated with lower employment probabilities. However, the intersection between disability and social categories is hitherto overlooked in the literature. Drawing on a case study of Belgium, this article empirically examines to what extent parental employment is explained by the child’s disability and/or the family’s social disadvantages. For this, unique and large-scale register data are used. The results show that (1) childhood disability overlapped with social disadvantages; (2) childhood disability inhibited parental employment; but (3) the relationship differed by social category: for single parents, parents with low educational qualifications, and parents having multiple disabled children, disability and social disadvantage reinforced each other.",

      "title": "Parental Divorce, Life-Course Disruption, and Adult Depression",
      "abstract": "We examine the association between adult depression and childhood parental divorce, and the explanations for this association, using a representative national sample of 2,592 adults interviewed by telephone in 1995. Parental divorce may disrupt the life course, with lifelong consequences for adult well-being in two ways: lowered socioeconomic status and problems in interpersonal relationships. Compared with individuals who grew up with both parents, adult children of divorce have lower levels of education, occupational status, and income, higher levels of economic hardships (both current and past), more often marry young, divorce and remarry several times, find themselves in unhappy relationships, and mistrust people in general. However they do not have lower levels of social support. These associations hold when we adjust for sex, minority status, age, parental death, and parental education. The disadvantaged socioeconomic and interpersonal statuses link parental divorce to adult depression because more education is associated with lower levels of depression and because economic hardship, early marriages, unhappy relationships and mistrust are associated with high levels of depression. There are no direct intrapsychic effects of parental divorce on adult depression. Low socioeconomic status and problems in interpersonal",

Die katamnestische Datenlage zum Spätverlauf im Erwachsenenalter ist im Gegensatz zum Verlauf in Pubertät und Adoleszenz ausgesprochen spärlich. Als Ergebnis einer Literaturrecherche fanden wir 21 methodisch heterogene Katamnesestudien. Der arithmetische Mittelwert des Alters aller untersuchten Probanden lag bei 24,0 Jahren. Die Ergebnisse lassen sich durch verschiedene Einzelfallstudien und durch vereinzelte autobiografische Berichte Betroffener ergänzen. Die für die Pubertät und Adoleszenz belegten diskontinuierlichen und dynamischen Verlaufsveränderungen lassen sich mit den verfügbaren Daten im dritten und vierten Lebensjahrzehnt nicht in vergleichbarem Ausmaß fortschreiben. Zugewinne an Kompetenz und Autonomie scheinen sich im Arbeitsleben eher als im häuslichen Bereich zu entwickeln. Die signifikant günstigeren Verläufe der von Asperger beschriebenen Form setzen sich auch im Erwachsenenalter fort. Der krankheitsassoziierte Mangel an Empathie und sozialen Kontaktmöglichkeiten wird von den Betroffenen keineswegs selbstgenügsam bewältigt, sondern eher als Verlust erlebt. Ein beträchtlicher Anteil erwachsener Autisten äußert interpersonelle sexuelle Bedürfnisse.

The influence of maternal attitudes, social support, and infant irritability on maternal behavior was assessed. Early maternal behavior did not predict later maternal behavior. Change in maternal behavior was associated with the mother's social support and with an interaction between her initial attitudes about responsiveness and her baby's irritability. Mothers with good social support were more sensitive toward their babies during reunion episodes of the Strange Situation than mothers with poor support. Mothers with unresponsive attitudes and irritable babies were the most insensitive to their babies in that setting. Crying during separation also predicted maternal sensitivity during reunion. It was found, however, that this infant behavior was associated with early maternal unresponsiveness rather than with neonatal irritability. Implications of change in maternal behavior for the child's attachment security are discussed.",

      "title": "Criminological implications of bio-psycho-social changes during childhood and youth",
      "abstract": "From the moment of birth, a child starts developing its personality under the influence of certain socio-cultural circumstances. As children cannot choose the historical setting, social or family background to be born to and to grow up in, children are believed to be faced with the “universal birth-risk syndrome” from their birth. Parental devotion, affection and warmth will help the child’s maturing process by eliminating the patterns of hostility, rebellion and distrust towards the parents, as well as child’s resistance towards its own development. The origins of asociality, and even delinquency, may be found in the earliest childhood. Emotional distress and anxiety caused by hostile or unfavorable family living conditions affect the child’s personality. Unsound attitudes, shaped in the first couple of years of child’s life, are seldom to be completely uprooted later on, and their impact can be traced all the way to adulthood. Embarrassment and shame, fear of mistakes or failure, and pangs of conscience are but a few different feelings demonstrated throughout child’s development, which impact the process of child’s social integration and independence. During puberty, a struggle to free oneself of parental dependence reaches its most prominent phase. Adolescence is the most sensitive and vulnerable period of emotional growth and maturity. Psychological literature often highlights the importance of parent education because it is the parents’ appropriate attitude and approach to the child’s upbringing that could prevent the development of adolescent crises and juvenile delinquency, as a separate form of unsuccessful adaptation of adolescents. A large number of criminal offenders started demonstrating antisocial behavior in the preadolescence period. In the pre-puberty period of development, physical and psychological characteristics of a child influence the development of deviant behavior (juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, suicide). In comparison to the malshaped attitudes, many forms of the so-called “problem behavior” are perceived as adequate child behaviour considering the age when they commonly appear. Insufficient understanding of the typical behavior of an ordinary child at different age creates misunderstandings and disputes between the children and the parents. However, some forms of “problem behaviour” are not to be ignored in hope that a child will eventually get out of it, overcome the problem alone, and spontaneously enter the next stage of development. Despite the fact that the period from childbirth to the age of 18 is full of temptations, the child demonstrating a personality disorder (on a smaller or a larger scale) is - in the adulthood period - most likely to either retain or further develop these hindering disturbances which are always to get in the way. To that end, research results have revealed that additional studies of adults who had an “asocial childhood” point to the significant differences in their personalities as compared to the people whose childhood was void of asocial behaviour.",

A case study was undertaken to describe and compare the workplace experiences of three female employees from one health organisation who were either preparing to commence, currently on or recently returned to work from maternity leave. At all stages of the maternity journey, women expected flexibility from their employer in negotiating their return to work and managing parenting responsibilities. Women's obligations to their employer included being open about their capacity to work and parenting situations which may interfere with their work, as well as maintaining their work performance. Within a supportive work environment that included a shared identity with managers who were also mothers, women's social identity as a worker was not significantly threatened and did not change. Social identity change may be most apparent during the transition to first-time motherhood.",

Yet there is evidence that Japan is ripe for change in such family behaviors. This article examines a set of innovative questions related to knowing individuals who have engaged in these behaviors by type of relationship (sibling, other relative, friend, and coworker) respondent has to such individuals. We find that a large proportion of the Japanese population knows someone who has cohabited, used childcare, had a nonmarital birth, or plans to remain unmarried. This knowledge is patterned by both relationship domain and social structural variables. There is a strong positive association between knowing someone who has engaged in one of these behaviors and attitudes toward nontraditional family behavior, suggesting pathways by which micro-level interpersonal interactions may be linked to macro-level social change.",

      "abstract": "A considerable percentage of Polish children from agricultural families are engaged by their parents in performing work activities on farms. The performance of these tasks arouses various emotional reactions in children, from the feeling of threat, fear and anxiety, to the feeling of satisfaction, being contented and proud. The subjective feeling of happiness and life satisfaction is an extremely important factor affecting the mental health and functioning of a human being. The objective of the study was to show to what extent the quality of communication between children and parents, and the level of family cohesion and adaptability according to the Circumplex Model by D. H. Olson et al., modifies children's emotional reactions associated with the tasks performed. The study covered 192 children aged 12-13, whose parents were running a family farm. Growing up in a healthy family characterised by a balanced level of cohesion, adaptability and good communication with the father and mother, favours the occurrence in children of pleasant emotions in reaction to work which they undertake on behalf of their parents on a farm. In such families, more often than in families with bad communication and dysfunctional families (disengaged, rigid), children experience satisfaction, have a feeling of deepening bonds with their parents, and the feeling of being more adult and preparing themselves well for adult life. Family characteristics which are evidence of disorders in its functioning (lack of good communication with the father, mother, lack of bonds between family members, rigid, chaos in a family) co-occur with the child experiencing unpleasant emotional states in associated with the work performed, there occur feelings of dissatisfaction, unhappiness, unpleasantness, the feeling that it would be better to learn than to work.",

Mothers participated with their 20-month-old firstborns and again, an average of 3 years later, with their 20-month-old secondborns (55 families, 165 participants). Continuity and stability in maternal cognitions and practices between the two times, and similarities, differences, and correspondences in siblings' behaviors, are assessed and compared. Maternal socioemotional parenting cognitions were continuous in mean level and stable in individual differences across siblings; maternal socioemotional practices were continuous in mean level but unstable in individual differences. Firstborns were more sociable and emotionally available to mothers than secondborns; first- and secondborns' socioemotional behaviors were largely unrelated. This study contributes to understanding socioemotional domains of parenting and child development, birth order effects, and the shared and nonshared contexts of siblings' environments within the family.",

No assets accrue from disability; a family has only those potentials it had earlier which may be abandoned or poorly used by a family in its coping endeavors, or utilized fully in making needed adjustments. The self-concept of a family need not be abandoned because of disability; in fact, a family may discover its central values and goals--a constructive rather than destructive process. The family as a social unit depends upon a range of supports to meet basic needs. Many of these resources exist within, and can be used to maintain the family as a unit. The disabled member must have a reciprocating function within the family even though he may have greatly altered capabilities, or the relationship will not endure. (Author /LAA),",

      "abstract": "Much has been written about the practice of caregiving and care for the elderly, especially in places like the traditional nursing home (e.g. Diamond 1986, Savishinsky 1991, Stafford 2003, Gass 2004). In the United States caregivers commonly refer to those professionals that constitute a cadre of nurses, nursing assistants (both certified and uncertified), therapists, palliative care/ hospice workers—and very often—family members, who help the elderly in a range of activities from ADL’s (activities of daily living) to providing companionship, and a host of other tasks. Professional caregivers working in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes (skilled nursing facilities) and assisted living homes often struggle to balance the need for personalizing care and doing everything on time, at the expense of treating residents as simply dress-up dolls. CNA’s and uncertified caregivers oftentimes look after more people than they can handle, leaving little room for striking up friendly conversation, expressing empathy, and engaging in simple human companionship. Family caregivers struggle in different ways, but are just as hard-pressed for time especially when their loved ones suffer from dementia related conditions (e.g. Alzheimer’s) that demand care and attention constantly. These family caregivers are sons, daughters-in-law, and siblings who are undoubtedly frustrated, and have little or no time to attend to their own stress and health issues. Caregiving in the presence of financial, emotional and family stress also adds pressure to the overall situation. Not only are caregivers personally affected, but the caregivers’ families and the people around them are affected by the ensuing stress. It is no surprise then that sociologists and gerontologists have focused their research in the past on such topics as communication between caregivers and the recipients of care, disputes arising between family members and caregivers, and ways to become better, more effective caregivers at home and in the community (e.g. Foner 1995, Ward 2008).",

CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1977, 48, 167-181. 20 infants were observed interacting with their mothers and fathers at home when they were 7, 8, 12, and 13 months of age. Infants showed no preference for either parent in the display of attachment behaviors, though both parents were consistently differentiated from a relatively unfamiliar investigator on these measures. This indicates that the infants were clearly attached to both parents from the beginning of attachment relations. Preferences in the display of affiliative behaviors were accounted for largely by differences in the degree of adult activity in interaction with the infants. As they grew older, infants were increasingly likely to direct attachment behaviors to all 3 adults. Infants responded more positively to father-infant play, though there were few differences in the types of play the parents initiated. Mothers held the infants most often to engage in caretaking functions, while fathers held them most often to play. It is argued that the father-infant and mother-infant relationships may involve different kinds of experiences for infants, such that the two parents have differential influences on personality development from infancy onward.",

      "abstract": "During the aging process, mental work requires many adjustments at a time when the methods of compensation or reorganisation may not be as effective as in the past. During this time, alcoholism may well intervene with and disrupt the functioning of the couple and the family. Where alcoholism is present, interdependence of the couple induces a specific relationship and a behavior pattern in both partners. In the functioning of the couple illustrated by a clinical case this notion is apparent within a phenomenon of acceptable pseudo-complementarity functioning where the behavior generates both suffering and spin-off benefits. This behavior contributes to the homeostasis of the couple and therefore to its continuation while also favouring the durability of alcoholism. It induces a different generational positioning, a break with the codes governing behavior within the couple, and it also leads to a tendency to infantilization. Moreover, the fear of losing the object of one's investment drives the dependency system. In these conditions, the couple, who need to anticipate this loss, generate a vicious circle which leads to the alienation of each of the partners. They adopt a deprivation avoidance behavior by establishing dependency, a preventive and paradoxical treatment for separation: \"so not to lose you, I am constantly in need\". This behavior is influenced by the potential distancing of one of the partners due to their serious excesses or the staggering sense of separation associated with aging.",

      "abstract": "One possible form of how children use parental models in their social relations would be if children showed more willingness to make friends with peers resembling their parents. To test this possibility, composite faces created from 3 to 6 year old children's photos were transformed to resemble facial images of their parents. The children were asked to show which one of the two same-sex transforms they find more appealing: the familial or the control face. Children who lived in emotional proximity to their parents, and in particular to their mothers, were attracted more to father-resembling faces than to unfamiliar ones. These results suggest that childhood experiences influence face preferences. This bias may affect social decisions later in adulthood, and could help to explain preferences for parent-resembling mates.",

Emotional support, having a friend as a confidant, and frequent church attendance were related to less distress.",

This study is significant as it investigates homelessness experienced by married couples with children in Singapore, unlike most other research which has examined homelessness among singles or single-parent families, and which is based in Australia, Europe, and the US. The sense of homelessness was shaped by the ecological environment that comprised systemic elements such as kin support, housing policies, and non-housing policies like citizenship, education, welfare, and so forth. Homelessness was seen as (i) a loss of complete autonomy, control, privacy, and comfort; (ii) the lack of physical, practical, and emotional support from kin; (iii) a compromised ‘sense of family’ and family decisions; and (iv) hope and endurance while interacting with the ecological system.",

De las familias y de las escuelas, se esperan nuevas respuestas para las que no se dispone de referencias de actuacion. De esta forma se encuentran, como instituciones con responsabilidad y con capacidad de decision, en un marco de confusion e inseguridad, en el que los esfuerzos desplegados no siempre consiguen la finalidad pretendida, incrementandose el desanimo en lo personal y el injusto descredito en lo social. A la perplejidad experimentada por las familias al no acertar en los modos de ejercer su accion socializadora, se suma la falta de nuevas referencias sobre las practicas escolares que, con frecuencia, desemboca en la anoranza de certidumbres y formatos que funcionaron en otros momentos historicos, con circunstancias significativamente distintas. Los mecanismos de convivencia, trato y educacion en los escenarios familiares y sociales no alcanzan el aprobado ni de lejos. Es necesario insistir en ello. Botones de muestra de esta circunstancia encontramos por doquier simplemente observando los no pocos achaques que se perciben en el cotidiano vivir de nuestros ninos y adolescentes. El presente conjunto de reflexiones aborda los problemas de convivencia en los centros educativos, asi como su mas inquietante producto, el acoso y maltrato entre companeros. En las ideas y datos planteados se subraya la incuestionable influencia del entorno en la generacion y proliferacion de conductas indeseables en el interior de los centros educativos, senalando sugerencias y propuestas elaboradas por la Institucion del Defensor del Menor para la prevencion y reduccion del fenomeno en cuestion",

The data show that for both men and women who believe that slapping one's spouse is normal, violence by their partner increases attitude-behavior consistency. The forms of family violence under study are both spousal and parental violence. Spousal violence is most frequent in those families in which the respondent's own violent attitude is accompanied by the violent behavior of the spouse. Violence is, therefore, used as a means to obtain a socially approved goal, namely the leadership role in the family, when society withholds legitimate means to obtain that goal. Patterns of interaction with spouse and kin are at least as important in the study of domestic violence as are respondents' attitudes. These patterns of interaction, in turn, are related to the extent to which the environment facilities or inhibits the performance of various roles in the family, such as that of parent, provider, or spouse.",

      "abstract": "The fastest growing family type in the UK is the stepfamily with social parenting an increasingly normal practice. Parenting policy and practice, which has increased exponentially over the last two decades, has historically been modelled on the biological nuclear family model with marginalised families the main recipients. The possibility that parents in marginalised stepfamilies might have separate and discrete parenting support needs to biological parents seems to be overlooked in policy, practice and research. Rather, the historical legacy of deficit, dysfunction and a ‘whiff’ of poor parenting in marginalised stepfamilies lingers on. The focus of the research was to determine marginalised parents’ perceptions and experiences of parenting in their stepfamily and their parenting support needs.\r\n\r\nThematic analysis of the data revealed accounts that were interwoven throughout with strong moral undertones which seemed to categorise their lives. The parenting issues were different and more complex than those they had encountered before. The parents adopted biological family identities, but these didn’t fit with their social roles and often rendered them powerless in their relationships with stepchildren. This appeared to have a cumulative effect which impacted on the already fragile couple relationship.\r\n\r\nDespite the parents easy articulation of the parenting issues there was a contrasting unease and ambivalence in discussing parenting support needs. Parenting support seemed to be an irrelevance that could be disregarded.\r\nUltimately the moral significance of the parents marginalised class positions appeared to be central to their lives, which has important implications for policy and practice.",

      "abstract": "Child-headed households (CHHs) have become a common and integral part of South African society. Millions of children have lost their parents and/or primary caregivers due to a variety of reasons of which the HIV/AIDS pandemic can be singled out as a major cause. It is therefore not uncommon today to have minors (under the age of 18 years) care for their younger siblings and/or ill parents or family. A child-headed household (CHH) refers to a living situation/arrangement where a child has taken charge of a household in terms of decision-making responsibilities as well as the responsibility to provide for the physical, social and emotional needs of others living with that particular child, in that household, and regardless of familial relationship. \r\nThis paper is concerned with the legal and ethical dilemmas that arise in a therapeutic relationship where a minor is the primary caregiver of a patient unable to care for him-/herself. Where do a medical practitioner’s responsibilities lie in communicating important medical information about the patient’s condition to the patient’s minor caregiver? While the patient’s rights to privacy and confidentiality are important, the patient’s particular condition and medical care may also necessitate that certain information be disclosed to the minor caregiver. However, the minor caregiver may not always be a willing party to this collaborative therapeutic relationship and the ability of such a minor to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the patient, or take on responsibilities in terms of this therapeutic relationship can also be called into question. The various therapeutic approaches, roles, skills and conditions of this unique form of agency should therefore be given due consideration from both a legal and ethical point of view.",

      "title": "Love Attitudes: Similarities between Parents and between Parents and Children",
      "abstract": "LOVE ATTITUDES SIMILARITIES BETWEEN PARENTS AND BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN* Jill Inman-Amos, Susan S. Hendrick, and Clyde Hendrick** As we attempt to understand how young adults form primary romantic attachments, we must consider a number of potential influences, ranging from parental socialization to peer group norms. The parent-child relationship usually is a child's initial primary social relationship, and may provide a model for later intimate relationships (e.g., Bowlby, 1969). How parents relate to each other may also affect the attitudes and values the child forms about relationships (e.g., Amato, 1986). In addition to the effects of their overt behavior, it may also be that the attitudes that parents hold about their own intimate relationships and about intimate relationships in general ultimately will influence their children's attitudes about relationships (e.g., Fisher, 1986). Young adults are also influenced heavily by their peers (for a review, see Gecas & Seff, 1990). Thus, a number of early socialization influences may affect the process of children's later formation of romantic attachments. This article is primarily concerned with how parents might affect one aspect of a child's romantic relationship, namely the child's attitudes toward love. This specific research issue exists within a broader context of attitude transmission and family relationships. Transmission of Attitudes Two perspectives informed the current research. The cohort perspective on attitudes (e.g., Bengston & Cutler, 1976) focuses on ways in which groups (identified by the various criteria of generational membership) differ with respect to specified attitudes or behaviors. Given this perspective, it might be expected that young adults would hold attitudes and values similar to those of their peers, and might be less likely to simply assume parental attitudes and values (e.g., Clebone & Taylor, 1992). A lineage perspective views childhood socialization as so intense that the attitudes formed in the family context are handed down from parents to child, persisting through adolescence and perhaps across the lifespan (Paikoff & Brooks-Gunn, 1991). As a result, children share parental perceptions of the world (Bengston & Black, 1973; Gecas & Seff, 1990). Parental attitude transmission may be influenced by a number of factors, including general family cohesiveness (Troll, Neugarten, & Kraines, 1969), attitude agreement between the parents (Jennings & Niemi, 1968), and parental supportiveness of the child (Sanders & Mullis, 1988). In contrast, some research indicates that the degree of emotional closeness between parents and their children may have little effect on how much parents influence their children (Acock, 1984; Kandel & Lesser, 1972; Smith, 1983). One key finding has been that attitude congruence between children and parents was highest for behaviors that were highly visible and salient over long periods of time (e.g., religious affiliation, political party affiliation), and lowest on abstract or diffuse attitudes and general value statements (e.g., Acock, 1984; Glass, Bengston, & Dunham, 1986; Smith, 1982). In other words, attitudes and values may need to have explicit referents in order for similarity between parents and children to develop. Consistent with this perspective, Fisher (1986, 1988) found that, among late adolescents, parent and child sexual attitudes were correlated in a high family communication group, but not in a low communication group. These findings suggest that attitude congruence between parents and children requires attitude visibility and salience. Some research has focused more specifically on how parents and young adult children may influence each other vis-a-vis the children's intimate relationships. For example, Leslie, Huston, and Johnson (1986) found that children may effectively block a parent's influence by not communicating about partners of whom they know their parents will disapprove (providing indirect evidence that parental attitudes are known and are indirectly shaping communication and behavior). …",

The infants helped another person by handing over objects the other person was unsuccessfully reaching for, but did not help reliably in situations involving more complex goals. When a programmed adult partner interrupted a joint cooperative activity at specific moments, infants sometimes tried to reengage the adult, perhaps indicating that they understood the interdependency of actions toward a shared goal. However, as compared to 18‐ and 24‐month‐olds, their skills in behaviorally coordinating their actions with a social partner remained rudimentary. Results are integrated into a model of cooperative activities as they develop over the 2nd year of life.",

L’étude a été réalisée à partir d’un échantillon représentatif de 2230 enfants pris en charge par les services de protection de la jeunesse au Québec, tiré de l’Étude d’Incidence Québécoise (ÉIQ). Les analyses de régression logistique montrent que treize caractéristiques sont associées à la recommandation du placement de l’enfant. Ces variables associées sont liées : 1) aux caractéristiques des figures parentales (une coopération parentale inadéquate, un nombre de problèmes connus du parent plus élevé et la présence d’un adulte significatif dans la vie de l’enfant autre que les figures parentales), 2) aux caractéristiques des familles (une structure familiale non traditionnelle : recomposée ou monoparentale, un seul enfant de la famille a été signalé et un logement jugé non sécuritaire), 3) aux caractéristiques des enfants (enfant de moins de 2 ans ou de plus de 14 ans et un nombre élevé de besoins pour l’enfant), et 4) aux caractéristiques des problématiques (plus d’une problématique signalée, un signalement pour abandon, un signalement qui ne concerne pas une situation « autre » de mauvais traitements, un nombre élevé d’atteintes à la santé mentale et un signalement provenant d’un membre de la famille).

      "abstract": "Cadre de la recherche : La situation de handicap entraîne une ou des formes de dépendance de la personne handicapée vis-à-vis de son entourage ou de professionnels. Des aidants, membres de la famille, sont alors sollicités de façon plus ou moins récurrente pour accompagner la personne dans les activités qu’elle ne peut accomplir seule. Animés par des pratiques relevant du care (du « soin à l’autre ») (Garrau et Le Goff, 2010), des liens particuliers, différents des relations ordinaires, se nouent en conséquence, notamment avec les parents. Ce type de relation fondée sur la dépendance interroge les modèles familiaux occidentaux, qui tendent à favoriser les liens électifs entre individus, ce qui dénote un mouvement d’autonomisation (De Singly, 2000) des individus et un primat de l’affection. La personne handicapée est alors prise entre deux forces contraires : la nécessité de faire appel à ses proches et/ou à des personnes ou des institutions extérieures, et la volonté d’être plus autonome ou aussi autonome qu’une personne non handicapée (De Singly, 2000). C’est précisément entre ces deux forces qu’intervient l’assistance animale, et plus précisément, ici, le chien guide. En tant qu’être vivant, le chien guide apporte un soutien quotidien à son maître, lui permettant d’adopter un rôle différent vis-à-vis des autres membres de la famille. Objectifs: L’objectif de cette enquête exploratoire est d’identifier les pistes de recherche autour de cette thématique de l’assistance animale. En effet, le gain d’autonomie par rapport à la famille et le soulagement que cela peut représenter pour les tiers aidants transforment des relations intrafamiliales initialement modifiées par le handicap. En parallèle se noue une relation d’affection spécifique à l’animal, qui lui vaut une place particulière au sein de la famille. Le chien n’a pas un statut de simple animal familier et n’est pas non plus un travailleur du care ordinaire. Il s’agit donc de comprendre les conséquences de l’assistance animale sur la façon dont la personne handicapée joue ses rôles au sein de la famille et d’éclairer les transformations de la place du chien dans les sociétés occidentales contemporaines à partir du statut du chien guide au sein de familles comptant une personne handicapée. Méthodologie: En France, l’Association Nationale de Maitres de Chiens Guides d’Aveugles (ANMCGA) a pris contact avec certains de ses adhérents les plus actifs afin de les informer de cette enquête. À la demande de l’enquêtrice et afin d’obtenir un échantillon le plus hétérogène possible, l’ANMCGA a sélectionné les répondants en fonction de critères de sexe, d’âge et de situation familiale. Onze entretiens semi-directifs d’une demi-heure à une heure ont été menés avec des maîtres de chiens guides. Des séquences de ces entretiens, en particulier de description d’évènements particuliers ont été analysés. Résultats: Il est montré comment le chien guide soutient son maître dans l’exercice de ses rôles d’enfant, de conjoint, de parent ou de grand-parent, notamment par le degré d’autonomie qu’il confère à son maître. Il est également décrit comment les proches et les moins proches accueillent l’assistance animale et intègrent ou non le chien dans le fonctionnement de la famille. En effet, grâce au chien, le maître peut se déplacer sans aide et accomplir toutes sortes d’activités qu’il n’aurait pu faire seul. Les aidants n’ont plus alors à adopter le même comportement de vigilance en présence de la personne déficiente visuelle. Le chien joue donc une fonction d’appui du maître dans ses rôles familiaux. Conclusion: Cette étude exploratoire permet de conclure que le chien joue une fonction d’appui dans les rôles familiaux en aidant le maître à remplir les rôles de fils/fille (d’un parent âgé), conjoint, mère/père, grand-mère/grand-père… L’ensemble des différentes phases de la vie exige aujourd’hui dans notre société une certaine autonomie et les rôles qui leur correspondent mobilisent des liens de solidarité familiale qui se reconfigurent en fonction de l’autonomie de chacun. L’assistance animale permet à la personne déficiente visuelle d’accomplir des activités qu’elle aurait eu plus de mal à réaliser sans son chien. De plus, l’assistance animale soulage les proches d’une inquiétude qui dans certains cas peut avoir un impact sur les dynamiques relationnelles. La présence constante des chiens auprès de leur maître les insère complètement dans toutes les activités familiales, contrairement à d’autres chiens ou animaux domestiques qui ne peuvent accéder à tous les lieux dans lesquels les membres d’une même famille sont amenés à évoluer et se retrouver. Ainsi, le travail de care accompli par le chien génère une dette à son encontre, à fortiori de la part de la personne déficiente visuelle qui considère qu’elle doit prendre soin de l’animal lorsque celui-ci rencontre des difficultés, mais également fréquemment par extension de la part des proches de la personne déficiente visuelle. Contribution: À notre connaissance, aucune étude similaire n’a été réalisée auparavant.",

However, there is a dearth of research on these families' direct, qualitative experiences with health-care providers. This study presents findings from interviews with 18 family members, predominantly parents, regarding their experiences with health-care providers during a child's terminal illness, from diagnosis to death. The importance of compassion emerged as a salient theme, manifested in myriad ways, and connected to participants' perception of caregiver presence in multiple domains. Families were likewise negatively affected by a wide variety of situations and behaviors that represented individual or institutional abandonment or nonpresence, and thus compounded the experience of loss.

And 3) given a context of structural disadvantage, to what extent is an individual's ability to participate in the more socially organized aspects of her community correlated with delayed sexual activity? There is limited support for socialization, supervision, and marital transition hypotheses as explanations for the probability of sexual debut and pregnancy. Stronger parent-child relationships are associated with delayed sexual onset, but are not related to pregnancy experience. Adolescents' perceptions of social support and cohesion among neighborhood adults are correlated with a decreased probability of pregnancy, while the odds of pregnancy are higher for teenagers with no working adults in their social networks.",

      "abstract": "Fathers figure prominently in a child's postdivorce life whether they are involved or disinterested, but concerns about inadequate child support, noncustodial fathers who fail to visit, and the economic plight of single mothers have together raised policy questions about how better to enfranchise fathers with the rights and responsibilities of parenting and ensure them a continuing and meaningful role in the lives of their offspring. This article focuses on obstacles and avenues to ensuring a meaningful postdivorce parenting role for fathers by examining the effects on them of custody standards, visitation policies, child support guidelines and their enforcement, and the other economic arrangements surrounding contemporary divorce. In the end, public policies that foster the child's unconflicted relationships with each parent in the context of reliable and adequate economic support will require new ways of structuring relations between ex-spouses in the interests of offspring (for example, new approaches to custody and visitation), nonadversarial modes of assisted dispute resolution to accommodate postdivorce changes in family life, child support policies which guarantee that a child's economic needs will be met when parents are unable to provide adequately (and that assist parents who are unable to provide), and that recognize and ensure both the relational and the economic contributions of each parent to a child's well-being.",

      "title": "‘They've probably had those animals for years – they are like family’: accommodating pets in care homes and their contribution to creating a sense of ‘home’",
      "abstract": "Abstract Companion animals, or ‘pets’, are integral to many people's lives and to their sense of home. However, older people living with companion animals are vulnerable to separation from their animals when moving to a care home. Such separation is often a highly significant loss which, combined with other losses, may reinforce experiences of dislocation. Existing research draws attention to the importance of developing a sense of ‘home’ in a care home through reinforcing and preserving personal connections. However, there is a paucity of research examining the preservation of connections between older people resident in care homes and their animal/s. This study draws on thematic analysis of 29 qualitative interviews with older people living in care homes, relatives, care home staff and other relevant stakeholders. It highlights that retaining existing, often long-term, bonds with companion animals represent important continuities and connections which may contribute to positive adjustment to life in a care home and creating a sense of home. However, participants highlighted that supporting an older person to move into a care home with their companion animal may be challenged by real or perceived constraints such as use of shared space, concerns about the risks posed by animals and staff implications. While our study found examples of good practice of how shared residence between an older person and companion animal can be achieved in a care home, other examples highlighted that the time, complexity of planning and structures required to accommodate animals were prohibitive to merit a change of policy and practice. Our research concludes that more attention should be given to the older person–animal bond as an important source of continuity and connection.",

      "title": "Lifetime Social Development in Female Japanese Macaques",
      "abstract": "The present chapter reviews lifetime social development of female Japanese macaques, mainly based on studies conducted on groups that are provisioned and free-ranging or wild. During the first year of life, infants not only nurse on their mothers but also acquire the repertoire of edible food items by intensively observing their foraging mothers. Differences between female and male juveniles in terms of social relationships with mothers and other group members become clear from the second year of life onward, with few differences observed among different groups. Juvenile females maintain relatively frequent interactions with their mothers and are inclined to maintain close proximity relationships with group members who usually form the center of the group; furthermore, they actually tend to interact with younger individuals through social play and infant-handling, while still rarely maintaining affiliative relationships with adult females other than their mothers. Adolescent females tend to be integrated into the social network after first giving birth. Dominance relationships among adult females are strongly influenced by group size: in relatively small groups, dominance relations adhere almost perfectly to Kawamura's rules, whereby females are collectively ranked within their kin-groups, and a clearly linear dominance rank order is apparent. However, with an increasing number of adult females in a group, the number of dyads whose dominance relationships do not follow Kawamura's rules tends to increase and the linear dominance rank order becomes less apparent. Although the Japanese macaque is categorized as a despotic species among Macaca species, each group may include some females who show egalitarian tendencies such as nonkin-biased grooming; such females may play a role in increasing the integrity and cohesion of a group. In Japanese macaque groups, the number of females who experience the postreproductive period is very small. However, some such aged females could contribute to the survival of their young grandchildren. Accumulating data on the daily life of each female and describing the long-term social relationships among females could lead to a fuller understanding of the lifetime social development of female Japanese macaques.",

Choć możliwa jest pewna dowolność w zakresie pełnienia roli społecznej, to jednak przekroczenie ustalonych granic może wiązać się z doświadczeniem przez człowieka negatywnych sankcji społecznych, a nawet prawnych. Rola rodzicielska jest jedną z wielu ról społecznych, którą człowiek może pełnić w swoim życiu. Charakterystyczne jest jej splątanie z innymi rolami społecznymi. Konsekwencją nakładania się kilku ról może być ich konflikt. Dzieje się tak w sytuacji doświadczenia przewlekłej choroby somatycznej przez jednego z rodziców. Kobieta dotknięta chorobą onkologiczną zaczyna pełnić rolę chorej, co uniemożliwia, utrudnia lub modyfikuje sposoby pełnienia dotychczasowych ról społecznych (w tym rodzicielskiej) i wymusza podjęcie nowych.

Such models, while historically important, have been unhelpful in blaming families and are poorly supported by empirical evidence.Aims: The aim of this paper was to expand and develop models around familial patterns which may be more clinically valuable.Method: Recent empirical and theoretical evidence around family's experiences of caring for someone with an eating disorder were explored.Results: Recent literature supports the view that families may become \"reorganized\" around the illness. The following processes are discussed: (i) The central role of the symptoms in family life, (ii) The narrowing of time focus on the here-and-now, (iii) The restriction of the available patterns of family interaction processes, (iv) The amplification of aspects of family functioning, (v) The diminishing ability to meet family life-cycle needs, and (vi) The loss of a sense of agency (helplessness).Conclusions: Families may become stuck in unhelpful interactions and lose sight of their own strengths and resources.

      "abstract": "Objective. Definition of communications of I-images of mothers with He-images of the own children, I-images of the foster mothers with He-images of foster children became the purpose of our research; establishment of communications of I-images of the foster mothers with the child parental relation and interaction. Background. The problem of social and perceptual reflection is current because the number of families with receptions and the sponsored children grows. Quite often adoptive parents aren’t ready to adequate interaction with nonnative children and return them in the system of guardianship, putting to children a severe psychological injury. One of the most important reasons of it is the discrepancy of ideal fixations on need of children for family and real perception of specific children by adoptive parents, rigidity of their attitudes — social installations. In this regard studying mechanisms and regularities of perception of the child in family since how the child is perceived in family, formation of his “Ya-concept”, formation of the personality, the relation with relatives, peers, teachers, with surrounding people directly depends is of particular importance. To minimize emergence of such psychoinjuring situations the in-depth study of mechanisms and regularities of social perception in the replacing families is necessary. Study design. Links between the structures of I-images of mothers and He-images of their native and adoptive children were investigated; links between socio-perceptual images and child-parental attitude (interaction) in foster families. Participants. Sample: 18 women from 29 to 59 years (M=48,05; SD=7,77) with only foster children and 20 women aged 37 to 48 years (M=39,85; SD=3,93) having only their biological children. Measurements. The technique “The structure of the image of a person (hierarchical),” developed by V.L. Sitnikov; two versions of the VRR questionnaire by I.M. Markovskaya, to study the interaction of parents with children and adolescents. Results. I- and He-images are indicators of child-parental relations in foster families. At the replacing mothers the controlling behavior in relation to the child is expressed. And high control can be shown in petty guardianship, persistence, to lead to restrictions and the bans. Conclusions. Reliable connections of socio-perceptual images of members of substitute families and child-parental relations were revealed, proving that these images are indicators of child-parental relations. The images children have similarity on structural characteristics both at foster, and at biological mothers. In representations of the foster mothers when forming an image of the foster child the orientation to the I-concept and ideas of what has to be the child is noted. The foster mothers identify themselves with foster children in the present and the future, more close relations with the foster child seek to establish. In comparison with foster, biological mothers are more open in communication with the children.",

Ce travail porte sur les interventions familiales aupres de personnes qui ont fait l’objet d’une hospitalisation sous contrainte en psychiatrie. Il s’appuie sur une enquete qualitative fondee sur des entretiens approfondis avec des proches (principalement des parents, mais aussi des freres et sœurs, conjoints et amis) de personnes ayant ete hospitalisees sous contrainte en psychiatrie (n=25) et sur des observations de rendez-vous (n=15) lors de permanences d’une association de proches, l’UNAFAM (Union Nationale des Familles et Amis de Malades Psychiques). Il montre que l’intervention des parents ne commence pas avec la qualification psychiatrique des troubles mais s’inscrit, dans un premier temps au moins, dans la continuite de l’intervention parentale aupres d’enfants adolescents ou jeunes adultes. Il met en evidence ce travail de qualification non-lineaire des conduites jugees problematiques par les proches, la qualification psychiatrique tendant a etre repoussee au profit d’autres hypotheses de conduites deviantes (usage de drogues, mauvaises frequentations…) ou d’une psychopathologisation euphemisee (« deprime », crise adolescente…) tant que le recours a la psychiatrie elle-meme ne parait pas indispensable – en tant que celle-ci dispose precisement d’un mandat d’enfermement lui donnant les moyens d’« empecher » des conduites et/ou en tant qu’elle est investie d’une capacite de guerison.

      "title": "Reactions and Feelings to a Close Relative’s Coming Out in a Heterosexual Relationship",
      "abstract": "Which different feelings and reactions do different family members show if an adult family member who has long been perceived as heterosexual discloses their sexual identity as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB)? Previous studies have investigated reactions of spouses and sometimes children in the United States. This article describes the findings of qualitative interviews and a German-language quantitative survey (N = 188) in which family members were asked about their emotions, experiences during the coming out process, and their use of support options. The samples were recruited via different LGB+ online forums and organizations in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (age M = 44.08). The results demonstrate that a coming out after years of a heterosexual biography and family life affects adults' parents and siblings in addition to spouses and children. Siblings were perceived as a supportive group of family members showing calm and mostly positive reactions. Parents mainly reported surprise but also showed on the one hand interest in supporting their children in the coming out process; on the other hand, we find also evidence for negative reactions including rejecting behavior. Children's coping and well-being depended on the time that had passed since the coming out and their age at the time of the coming out. Spouses felt shocked, angry, and the ground was pulled from under their feet. Comparing the perspectives of these groups of family members, differences between them, and their specific needs are discussed. Practical implications are derived from the support options mentioned, and range from information from books, the internet to professional advice. Spouses report the need of diverse support options, whereas other family members ask friends and other family members for support. Forums, counseling and the possibility to exchange were perceived as a support but were more accessible for women than for men. They provide the chance for a communicative exchange before the stress becomes too strong.",

Younger (22 to 35 years old) and older (65 to 77 years old) participants read vignettes where age of characters committing social transgressions varied (young vs. old). Participants rated whether the offended person would respond with engagement, confrontational, and avoidant behaviors and how much people would blame or forgive the transgressor. Multilevel models revealed endorsement of avoidant behaviors with older transgressors, confrontational behaviors with younger transgressors, and engagement behaviors with both. Levels of blame and forgiveness mediated this association, with less blame and greater forgiveness of older adults. Discussion focuses on the social input model and why adults may regulate reactions to interpersonal problems with older adults.",

The analysis of indepth interviews with one member of 99 remarried families with children indicates that (1) stepparents are expected to share equally in child-rearing duties in over half of the families, but less than natural parents, (2) equal sharing of decisions regarding children characterized less than a third of the sample, and (3) sanctions for stepparents who refuse to bring up stepchildren are not as strong as those for natural parents. A sizable proportion of reconstituted families differs considerably from the two-parent family model. Discussion focuses on whether this variation is always or necessarily problematic.",

The study is based on a 1981 national sample of 1,400 children aged 12-16. Disruption was associated with a higher incidence of several behavior problems, negative effects being greatest with multiple marital transitions. The negative effects are lower if the child lives with the same-sex parent following divorce or maintains a good relationship with one or both parents. High, persistent conflict in intact families is also related to behavior problems.",

Especially where perinatal substance use is concerned, moralized mother-centric discourse still easily eclipses attention to fathers’ roles. In this exploratory study, we analysed interviews with low-income new and expectant parents (26 mothers and 8 fathers) in Victoria, B.C. who self-identified as being impacted by drugs or alcohol. Using thematic analysis, we found fatherhood ideals framed how both paternal substance use and father absence were problematized. Paternal substance use was seen as problematic when it impacted the health of children indirectly by compromising maternal support, directly by increasing probability or severity of domestic violence, or by otherwise undermining the ability of a father to fulfill his role as he understands it. Parents espoused targeted perinatal services for fathers to break the intergenerational cycle of addiction and disadvantage.",

      "abstract": "Families who experienced a successful outcome to family therapy appeared to be ready to terminate when they had made a paradigm shift in their thinking about family problems and how to resolve them. In this study families communicated two signs of readiness to terminate therapy; 1) the family stopped focusing on the child as a problem and viewed the child as growing up; 2) the parental dyad expressed a renewed sense of confidence in themselves to handle any relationship problems that might arise in the family. Families who remain focused on the problems of the child were not confident in their own ability to handle relationship problems and frequently sought an outside agent e.g., therapist, to create and/or maintain a solution for the family, i.e., to fix the index person. The families who remain focused on the index person were often ambivalent about termination. Furthermore, families who showed a readiness to terminate use a three-stage process, a) the family relied on the therapist to initiate the suggestion, b) the family eventually claimed ownership of the idea, and c) the family negotiated with the therapist how to terminate therapy. A good therapeutic alliance between family and therapist did not appear to influence the decision to terminate. Ambivalence by families towards the social worker also did not appear to influence the family's readiness to stop family therapy. Three areas of further research are suggested by this study. How might therapists gauge readiness to terminate in families? Are there any early signs of readiness",

      "abstract": "Most adults prefer to stay with family when they get older and require assistance with day‐to‐day activities or chronic health issues. However, the many stresses associated with caring for a parent can be difficult for the adult child to manage. As they care for an aging parent, adult children can feel isolated and deprived of social connections with others. In often putting their parent's needs above their own, adult child caregivers' physical and mental health may be left unattended. Additionally, adult children may be caring for their own children, and in some cases grandchildren, too – leaving them without a known support system to communicate with that truly understands their challenges. Other caregiver–care receiver‐related challenges can include conflicts stemming from adult child and parent role reversal, as well as difficulties in defining family caregiving roles and responsibilities – particularly amongst adult child siblings. For the primary adult child caregiver, receiving social support and expressions of gratitude from other family members is significant in reducing any potential conflict and increasing the adult child's feelings of adequacy in their caregiving efforts.",

      "abstract": "Helping is usually perceived as a positive behavior, but it can also have negative side effects. Moreover, helping decisions are often embedded in complex social situations that can create social dilemmas for children and adults, such as the decision whether or not to help a friend steal. However, based on previous research, it remains unclear how young children decide in such complex social situations and how their decisions differ between preschool- and elementary school age. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the moral decisions of 4- to 8-year-old children in complex social situations ( N = 152 children; 69 girls; all European, urban and middle-class). In a 2 × 2 design, each child was asked whether a story protagonist should help or not help in four different conditions, namely helping a friend or a stranger to get their own object (i.e., moral conditions), or helping a friend or a stranger to take someone else's object (i.e., immoral conditions). We found that children clearly approve of helping in moral conditions and generally disapprove of helping in immoral conditions. We also found that older children were more likely to disapprove of helping in immoral conditions. Furthermore, children preferred helping friends to helping strangers only in moral but not in immoral conditions. Taken together, these findings suggest that children's decisions to help undergo significant changes from preschool to elementary school, as they are further qualified by criteria such as respecting the rights of others and avoiding harmful consequences of helping for third parties.",

Unlike in earlier times, the number of siblings is usually limited today, but the number of constellations in which children live together in patchwork or other family forms for a long period of their childhood and adolescence is increasing. The respective position in the circle of siblings is indeed significant, but in the course of socialization there are so many influencing factors that a determinant influence cannot be proven, «the typical» first- or second-born child (etc.) does not exist, the «duplication theorem» does not explain the individual case. This does not mean, however, that it wouldn’t be of interest to reflect on the individual experiences within the framework of family therapy discussions. In the case of tense sibling relationships and rivalries, it is advisable not only to look at the relationship between the two, but to reflect on the relationship to significant third parties (usually the parents).

      "title": "Bereavement meanings and the conditions for successful social support service encounters",
      "abstract": "Purpose Bereavement is far reaching and has a significant impact on many lives as widow(er)s are faced with countless changes to their everyday routines, their relationships and their consumption patterns. It is in this context that the purpose of this study is to examine the links between the meanings of bereavement for widows and the types and sources of social support sought. This deepens the understanding of the reasons for the success or failure of service encounters and thus contributes to consumer well-being. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study was carried out to gain more insight into this issue. A total of 24 in-depth interviews were conducted with French widows 59 years of age and older. To fully understand the diversity of bereavement experiences, the authors examined the following factors: life trajectory, life, as the spouse’s/partner’s death, support received and/or solicited and the success or failure of service encounters. Findings The findings suggest that bereavement experiences hold different meanings related to the types and sources of the preferred support. The following six classes were identified: dealing with administrative and financial issues, maintaining parental roles, enduring the memories of the circumstances of the spouse’s/partner’s death, reorganizing daily life, facing the loneliness of widowhood and expressing the affects of bereavement. These classes help to identify the conditions for the success or failure of service encounters. Originality/value The following two avenues emerge that contribute to the well-being of widows: “loss-oriented” and “restoration-oriented” bereavement classes of meanings. The former is embodied by widows primarily seeking “nurturant support” who expect self-oriented and relationship-focused service behaviour on the part of service providers, and the latter by widows primarily seeking “action-facilitating” support who expect “task-oriented” service behaviour from service providers. These results should allow service providers to be aware of when to prioritize the task, the self and/or the relationship, to provide a successful service encounter for consumers of bereavement services.",

      "title": "Mothers' Bereavement: Experiences of Marginalization, Stories of Change",
      "abstract": "MOTHERS' BEREAVEMENT EXPERIENCES OF MARGINALIZATION, STORIES OF CHANGE* Elizabeth B. Farnsworth and Katherine R. Allen** Feminist and contextual theory guided this qualitative investigation of the experiences of mothers bereaved of young children. Mothers' altered status provided the basis for reflection and for the development of new behaviors to cope with their loss. Subjective accounts of marginalization and stories of change were revealed as ongoing processes of bereavement Implications for practitioners include: listening to mothers; providing linkages among families, professionals, and communities; and conducting in-depth interviews with multiple family members. Late 20th-century American parents who experience the death of a young child do so in a sociohistorical context in which a child's death is statistically less prevalent than in earlier historical periods. During Puritan and Colonial periods, for example, death was omnipresent in everyday family life with almost half of all children dying before reaching adulthood. In 1900, one half of all parents would have experienced the death of a child; by 1976 only 6% would (Skolnick, 1991). With these shifts in occurrence, the death of a child has come to be viewed as a devastating loss from which a parent may never fully recover, instead of a normal hazard of parenthood (Knapp, 1987). Americans tend, for the part, to deny death and to use euphemisms for death rather than the words dying, dead, and death (Leming & Dickinson, 1994). Contemporary parents are situated in a social context in which open discussion of death is taboo (Stinson, Lasker, Lohmann, & Toedter, 1992). Numerous theoretical approaches have guided the study of parental bereavement. Individual perspectives on bereavement, such as a psychodynamic approach, assume that unconscious processes and individual factors determine bereavement outcomes (Lindemann, 1944). A sociobiological approach emphasizes the role of genetic survival or propagation of genes into the next generation in the bereavement reactions of individuals (Littlefield & Rushton, 1986). Cognitive theories focus on the information processing of bereaved individuals (Lazarus, 1966). Phase and stage models chronologically describe reactions following a loss (Bowlby, 1969; 1980; KublerRoss, 1969). Although numerous theoretical approaches have guided the study of bereavement, one most suitable theory has not emerged (Cleiren, 1993). We concentrate specifically on the bereavement of mothers in this investigation. Little scholarly attention has been devoted to their long-term bereavement or to women's own accounts of their experiences. Previous studies of mothers bereaved of a child frequently have focused on the measurement of symptoms and problems through the use of psychological instruments, such as the Beck Depression Inventory and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Many studies compare the severity of symptomatology of mothers with others, such as fathers, adult children, and siblings, finding mothers to be more seriously affected by the death of a child than fathers or other comparison groups (Cleiren, 1993; Dyregrov & Matthieson, 1987; Leahy, 1992; Littlefield & Rushton, 1986; Miles & Demi, 1984; Sanders, 1979-1980; Zisook & Lyons, 1988). An emphasis on the symptomatology of bereavement may lead to a reified or static picture of these mothers, the invisibility of the social contexts within which a child's death occurs, and the absence of mothers' voices and perspectives in the construction of knowledge about them. In contrast, feminist and contextual perspectives shift the research focus to mothers' perspectives of the death of a child and to interest in the ways mothers change over time during their bereavement. Feminist and contextual perspectives provide a conceptual undergirding for this investigation and raise consciousness of the social systems of mothers. …",

      "title": "Nonresident Father Visitation, Parental Conflict, and Mother's Satisfaction: What's Best for Child Well-Being?",
      "abstract": "This study examines the interrelationship of nonresident father visitation, parental conflict over this visitation, and the mother's satisfaction with the father's visitation. We consider the prevalence and characteristics of diverse family types defined by these interrelated processes and the implications of these arrangements for child adjustment, global well-being, and behavior problems. Data come from the first wave of the National Survey of Families and Households, from mothers in households with children younger than 18 years old who had a father living elsewhere. Results show that a variety of family constellations exist. Children are least well off in families in which mothers are dissatisfied with high levels of father contact. Key Words: children, divorse, fathers, nonresident parents, visitation. The role of nonresident fathers in family life is receiving increased attention, yet many aspects of these fathers and their interaction with their children and with the residential mother are still unknown. In particular, little attention has been paid to the diversity of nonresident parenting arrangements and the resulting implications for family relationships and child well-being (Bray & Depner, 1993). Understanding the implications of these arrangements, particularly for child well-being, is crucial, given that approximately 50% of all children will live in a single-parent family at some point in their childhood (Bumpass, 1984). We examine the interrelationship of nonresident father visitation, parental conflict, and the mother's satisfaction with the father's contact. We describe the prevalence and characteristics of diverse family types defined by these interrelated processes, and we consider the implications of these different arrangements for child adjustment, global well-being, and behavior problems. We address several questions unexplored in prior research. How are the mother's satisfaction with visitation, parental conflict over visitation, and the levels of father visitation related to each other? Are these relationships linear or monotonic, as is often assumed? Under what conditions are mothers most satisfied? Which family types are most prevalent, and how do they differ in demographics and family processes? How are these different family types related to child adjustment, global well-being, and behavior problems? In which families are children doing the best and the worst? Parents influence their children both by the way they behave toward their children and by the way they interact with one another (Lamb, Pleck, & Levine, 1986). Therefore, the parental relationship also must be taken into account when assessing the importance of nonresident fathers' contact for child well-being. Yet prior research has never simultaneously addressed how the interrelated processes of visitation, conflict, and satisfaction work together or how they affect child development. Furthermore, there is a lack of information about the prevalence of different nonresident parenting arrangements. Much of the existing research is based on small, unrepresentative samples or on the experiences of divorcing couples in particular states (Maccoby & Mnookin, 1992; Nord & Zill, 1996b). These studies may not reflect the experiences of most nonresident or custodial parents and their children. First, what do we know about nonresident parenting? NONRESIDENT PARENTING Visitation Many children have little contact with their nonresident fathers, and contact generally declines over time (Furstenberg & Harris, 1992; King, 1994a; Seltzer, 1991). Yet contact is crucial if nonresident fathers want to maintain ties to their children (Fox, 1985), and fathers who visit their children every week are likely to establish different relationships than fathers who rarely visit (Seltzer & Bianchi,1988). Geographic distance, time since separation, and remarriage of one or both parents are associated with declining father contact. …",

      "title": "Nuevas familias en contextos complejos. Abordajes interdisciplinarios",
      "abstract": "The project emerges when a substantive change in the concept of family is observed in the present times; new conformations are emerging, and interdisciplinary work has thus become increasingly important when working with families. The present research’s goal is to learn about the characteristics of the interdisciplinary approach in relation to the new family conformations and difficulties from the perspective of the social workers, as well as their social representations about the conformations. The final conclusions that emerged from the research indicate that social workers find multiple conformations, mainly assembled families, and a large amount of single parent families and adolescent mothers; traditional nuclear families are no longer predominant. Professionals show a high level of acceptance of these new conformations, although yet prejudice -more or less explicitly- is still present, and determines courses of action. In general, social workers do not observe a greater incidence of dysfunction in new conformations, showing acceptance towards them, which does not mean that older paradigms have stopped operating unconsciously. Social acceptance of these new conformations is essential to prevent rejection and marginalization from pushing these families into dysfunction, by way of the self-fulfilling prophecy. The most frequent problem is violence, in all its manifestations. In second place, appear abandonment and neglect towards children and elders; followed by addictions and crime. Social workers value interdisciplinary work. It allows them to save time, to increase efficiency, to complement knowledge, and to provide support and acknowledgement. It has been observed that intra-institutional interdisciplinary work is more frequent than articulation between institutions, with lack of formal intervention protocols. Social workers observe a trend to the paradigm shift, from a positivist approach with traditional professions hegemony to an integrative approach that includes different professions working in cooperation. Finally, gender was a topic present in all intervention areas. Women are considered selfless carers. This is reproduced in social work, where social workers lack any protection that may palliate their high exposition level.",

La necesaria diferencia inter-generacional y de posiciones entre los actores educativos se altera, aumentando la indiferenciacion imaginaria y la agresion entre ellos.

EnglishThe ideological speech that signals the present social framework favors and stimulates narcissistic positions in which all the difference is suppressed and, in consequence, the other cannot be registered in its uniqueness. This lack of recognition of the otherness that institutions undergo, affects the educational scene as it works on the relationships that are built there. The necessary intergenerational differences and the positions among the teaching actors are altered, increasing the lack of imaginary differentiation and the aggression among them. Consequently, sometimes the guiding and distress -relieving answers are missing. The institutions and the adult world facing the adolescent burst at secondary school feel overwhelmed and become too permissive, extremely severe or just leave them alone. Without adults who set limits and are able to listen, the anguish and drives are increased and the actions become a feasible solution when they constitute a message for the other who does not listen. Actions´effects of the texts produced by the subjects in the school that advice us about the urgency of revising the educational relationship. This warning drifts us apart from the temptation of repeating or reproducing senseless actions and makes us face our first challenge: the necessary revision of the notion of the otherness that supports every social tie, the unavoidable re- invention of an US which lays the foundations for the future of teaching.",

      "title": "The Role of Aesthetics in Socialization and Social Integration of the Institutionalized Elderly",
      "abstract": "Within the individualized plan of assistance and care that underpins the assistance of the elderly in difficulty for whom it was decided to provide care and assistance either at home, in the family/family environment, or a residential institution/service, one of the three big areas of intervention are given by socialization and social integration (along with medico-social care activities and recovery/preadaptation/rehabilitation activities). Socialization and social integration, through the motivations to live they provide, contribute by far decisively to the quality of life of the elderly (including the shaping of good/satisfactory subjective health) and the protection of the elderly against various forms of mistreatment. Considering the role that, throughout the millennia of human existence, the aesthetic has played, the ways and forms of its manifestation, the emotion generated and which removed the human being from the animal area, as due to its congeneric coexistence at least with homo sapiens, they cannot be ignored in any process that regards / frames / shapes the human being. For this reason, it is very important to know if the aesthetic has anything to do with socialization and social integration in general, if it can influence it and in what way, and in particular, if it can influence and in what way the socialization and social integration of the institutionalized elderly person who invariably experiences a double mourning of separation (from his family and his usual native environment). Given that quantitative research could only provide a \"snapshot\" of the process at the time of the research or at most a tendency or a trend, we opted for qualitative research that can provide us with the comprehensive resource we need to develop later practical approaches to the socialization and social integration of institutionalized elderly people from an aesthetic perspective. We based our approach starting from the classic statement of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) that in the spiritual sciences, unlike the natural sciences, we are dealing with conscious beings who react to stimuli in the surrounding world according to their representations, their beliefs, and values, the specific approach of knowledge is a comprehensive one, of reconstructing the meaning that individuals attribute to their behaviors and taking into account his remark that \"We explain things, but we understand people\". As a result, we used the focus-group method combined with the life story. The research group was elderly people institutionalized in the Jimbolia Home for the Elderly, not dependent or semi-dependent on care, who have preserved their fundamental cognitive capacities. This group is representative not only of Timiș County because the people in it come from several areas of it and have their origins in various cultural areas in the country.",

      "title": "Sadness in young children and the inadequate development of inner outer containment in childhood",
      "abstract": "Violent crimes and domestic violence are notoriously high in South Africa, which leaves many children defenceless to struggle with emotions such as loneliness and sadness. The healthy development and socialisation of children can be difficult in a society characterised by domestic tribulations, poverty, crime, single-parent homes, and absent parents. In South Africa, children often do not co-reside with their biological parents, mainly due to labour migration and low marital rates. Divorce and long working hours for parents also contribute to limited family interaction. Many children are raised by grandparents or older siblings and relatives, especially in rural areas. Due to these and other factors, children experience poor parental attachment, loss, sadness and loneliness, which impact their general well-being. These correlator factors often contribute to weak outer and inner containment, which are essential for a young person to develop sustained law abiding behaviour. Being sad and lonely often prompts issues such as delinquency, violence, insecurity, insufficient self-control, and bullying. Reckless’ containment theory shows that these behaviours often stem from the absence of the inner and outer controls that are necessary for the development of normative behaviour. Healthy bonding with and attachment to significant others are also important to the development of normative behaviour. In this contribution, the findings from a study conducted in Limpopo, South Africa, are discussed. The qualitative research study involved asking 373 children, between the ages of eight and nine years, to draw and narrate what made them sad. The researchers wanted to determine the specific challenges that young South African children face. In line with the interpretivist paradigm, it was also important to determine what these children regarded as sad and challenging situations, to understand their unique perspectives and life worlds. The study was therefore guided by the research question: What challenges do young South African children face in their daily lives? Findings revealed that exposure to bullying, loss, inadequate attachment, and crime can cause the development of weak inner and outer containment, which might lead to future misbehaviour, poor self-control, incorrigible actions, and bullying behaviour.",

The results show that the readiness to give nursing care is highly dependant on the care recipient. Independant from age, sex or social class, there is an strong readiness concerning care of the partner. Regarding other relatives (children, parents) or non-related persons like friends or neighbours, women show greater readiness than men to take over nursing care activities. Age and social class provoke differences, but not in such a homogenious way.

      "abstract": "Abstract Parental care has been categorized into direct and indirect investment. The former includes direct contact with the offspring, as in lactation or huddling with the pups, and the latter includes activities such as nest building or hoarding food for the guarding mate. We report here an unfamiliar type of parental behavior in which one parent aggressively forces its mate to stay in the nest with the pups. In this “forced baby‐sitting,” one parent grasps the fur of its mate and drags it toward the nest. The behavior was observed in 6 of 10 pairs of the social vole ( Microtus socilalis guentheri ) and was typically executed by the male. Dragging the mate to the nest was not correlated with other parental behaviors; neither could we explain why‐when it occurred. However, this behavioral pattern was eye catching, and its goal was obviously to enforce the mate to stay in the nest with the pups. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 41: 236–240, 2002.

En la actualidad, los cambios socioeconomicos parecen haber afectado el funcionamiento de muchas familias, tornandose dificil cumplir con las funciones basicas de sosten (emocional y/o material) (CEPAL, 2004). Objetivo: presentar caracteristicas estructurales y funcionales del apoyo percibido en ninos que habitan contextos de vulnerabilidad socioeconomica. Metodologia: administracion de la Escala de los Otros Significativos adaptada para poblacion infantil (Power, Champion y Aris, 1988; adaptacion Minichiello, 2006) a un grupo de 40 ninos de entre 9 y 11 anos que habitan contextos de vulnerabilidad socioeconomica. Resultados: el 48% de los sujetos no percibe ayuda en alguna de las situaciones planteadas. En cuanto a los roles que cubren dichas funciones, es la madre la que mayores porcentaje obtiene. El analisis de datos muestra que algunas funciones del apoyo son desempenadas por la television y las mascotas.

      "abstract": "This qualitative study examined the experiences of 25 adult children who initiated or maintained estrangement from one or both parents. Participants often stated that they initiated or maintained estrangement to provide relief and space to heal from a difficult relationship, but it was also experienced as a considerable loss that impacted them across the lifespan. They missed having a family and the benefits of such a relationship, including emotional, financial and physical support. However, the majority stated that they did not miss 'their own family' or the person they were estranged from, often taking active measures to keep the estrangement status intact. Estrangement also appeared to affect participant's experiences of other relationships with non-estranged family members, work colleagues, and potential partners and friends. These findings suggest social work practice that is focused on understanding and addressing grief reactions, a critical examination of family, stress reduction, and reconnection to safe and trusting relationships.",

Five prominent features of mother and infant exchanges in this short-term longitudinal study are described and discussed in the context of three models of unique environment-development relations: covariation, stability, continuity, correspondence, and prediction. Generally, mothers' activities did not positively covary at either age, nor did those of infants. Some maternal activities were stable in this time period; some developmentally increased, and some developmentally decreased. Infants' activities were unstable, but most increased over time. Specific mother and infant activities corresponded, and over time mothers and infants influenced one another in specific ways. In the critical period of the first half year, infants appear to be flexible and plastic in their behavioral repertoires and are influenced by their mothers; mothers are somewhat consistent, but they also adapt to the behaviors of their infants.",

Findings from multilevel models indicated that widowed parents were more likely to report irritable interactions with their grown children than the married ones. Furthermore, married and widowed parents tended to report more negative mood, whereas separated parents tended to report less negative mood on days they had irritable interactions with grown children. This study highlights the centrality of aging parents’ daily interaction with grown children and suggests that the dynamics of family composition warrant attention.",

      "abstract": "The basic and most essential unit of social organization, the family, has been carefully studied by many researchers, all of whom have agreed that in it lies a tremendous force which determines the behaviour of youth.The family is the prime determiner of social behaviour. From it emerge children who are indelibly stamped with high ideals and noble aspirations, or with low, vile, anti-social attitudes towards life.Main factors influencing juvenile delinquency are family structure to which children are exposed to and the relationships adolescents have with parents. As with patterns of juvenile delinquency, family structure has also changed dramatically over the last century, becoming very diverse in today’s society. Adolescents of all ages are living in many various types of homes, such as with single, married, or cohabiting parents. The families that children grow up in and the social environment in which they live in can have major effects on their well-being . There is a large body of research that shows children from non-intact homes show higher rates of juvenile delinquency than children from intact homes, partially due to weaker parental control and supervision in non-intact homes.Another potential factor of youth’s delinquency is family socioeconomic status. Children from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are at greater risk of a range of negative outcomes throughout their life course than their peers; however the specific mechanisms by which socioeconomic status relates to different outcomes in childhood are as yet unclear.In this article we hope to point out a few of the most potent factors in the home which are determinants of juvenile delinquency.Methods: The article will analyze data from a research of valid court cases on the area of Primary Court in Skopje. The focus will be on cases against people who did not fulfilled 18 years of age in the time of committing the crime (juveniles), in the period of 2005 – 2016.",

Data were obtained by semi-structured interviews. The results showed that, on average, children contact their parents and family members once a month. In addition, variables such as family image in children’s mind and joyfulness when meeting parents are the best predictors of contact between children and parents, family members. The contact between children and parents is arguably considered as a form of consolidation and maintenance of emotional relationship.",

      "abstract": "Earlier quantitative research shows that major life events that mark the transition to adulthood (emerging adulthood) affect sport participation, mostly in a negative way. However, insight regarding the explanatory mechanisms behind these effects, which is needed to better prevent drop out and stimulate sport participation over the life course, is lacking. This qualitative study aims to fill this gap by investigating why people change their sport behaviour during emerging adulthood, specifically when major life events occur that mark this transition period within two life domains: the professional career (e.g. entering high/secondary school and higher education, leaving fulltime education, beginning to work) and the family domain (e.g. engaging in an intimate relationship, cohabitation, marriage, becoming a parent). Analysis of 45 Dutch adults’ narratives on their sport participation during the transition to adulthood and the role of these life events, revealed that when the life events occurred, new time consuming and physically and/or psychological demanding activities, roles and responsibilities arose that are more obligatory and fixed, and held higher social pay-offs then (existing) sport activities. This altered people’s daily routines and led to a reconfiguration of resources with (new) opportunities and constraints for sport participation. Based on this new resource balance and associated opportunities and constraints for sport participation, people made a deliberate choice on if sport participation fitted in their new life situation or not, and if so, in what way/how it fitted best. However, there was diversity in the choices that people made regarding (changing) their sport participation, based on different trade-offs between their opportunities and constraints for sport participation.",

Fruhe und pubertare Objektverluste kennzeichnen den Entwicklungsgang der jungen Mutter und Vater.

Die reale Beziehung zum Kind ist von einer unabweislichen Ambivalenz durchdrungen. Daruber hinaus ist das Kind passiv in die chronifizierten Ablosungsmanover zweier Generationen verstrickt. Dem Kind fehlt ein identitatssichernder Bezugsrahmen. Es unterliegt ebenso wechselhafter wie gefahrlich grenzenloser Anteilnahme. Dem Adoptivkind vergleichbar, wachst das Kind adoleszenter Eltern im Bewustsein fragwurdiger Existenzberechtigung auf; seine Herkunft bleibt ihm vielfach verdunkelt und eine adaquate Geschwisterbeziehung verschlossen.",

      "title": "Filial Maturity and Caregiving to Aging Parents",
      "abstract": "The aging of parents results in changes in the filial relationship. The increasing vulnerability of parents leads adult children to realize that they have individual needs and cannot fully function as sources of security and protection, as they did before. Simultaneously, the evidence of losses and disability imposes the need for care, which tends to be assumed by adult children. Therefore, there is a progressive change in the volume of support exchanges between parents and children, with more support from adult children to parents. The way adult children adapt to these transitions is influenced by several internal and relational factors. Filial maturity has been associated with filial caregiving towards aging parents. The concept of filial maturity describes a developmental stage in which the adult child overcomes the filial crisis, realizing and accepting that the parent also needs support and comfort and starting to relate to him/her beyond the strictly parental role. Thus, this study aims to explore the role of attachment and mental representation of caregiving in filial maturity. A total of 304 children aged between 35 and 64 years old participated in this study, with at least one of the living parents aged 65 years or older, not institutionalized. Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale, mental representation of caregiving with the Mental Representations of Caregiving Scale and filial maturity with the Filial Maturity Measure. The results suggest that attachment, mental representation of caregiving and the interaction between the two explain 24.5% (p &lt; 0.01) of variability in Comprehending and 11.1% (p &lt; 0.05) of variability in Distance, two dimensions of filial maturity. These findings suggest that it is important to consider mental representation of caregiving and attachment when adult children must adapt to changes in the filial relationship and to the need to care for parents.",

      "abstract": "Previous explanations of limited participation by males as family caregivers assume that socialization to dominant gender stereotypes is a universal barrier among men. Overlooked are 1) variations in the degree of internalization of gender typed attitudes that enable intense participation in a wide variety of personal care tasks and the assumption of the chief caregiver role among some men, and 2) social psychological processes used to resolve cognitive dissonance among men considering caregiver activities and/or role enactment. The present examination of these processes is responsive to calls for enhancing our understanding of the personal meaning that caregiving has for men. The introduction of Risman's view that current experience influences socialized predispositions, allows the delineation of conditions under which husbands, sons, and other male relatives who have internalized stereotypical self images of masculinity can also assume caregiver roles in the family. Drawing on interview data from a purposive sample of thirty-two men who were chief caregivers for elderly relatives, case study material is presented to illustrate several pathways by which male respondents gained access to family caregiving roles.",

Adolescents experience numerous developmental challenges at varying pace, including: increasing need for independence; evolving sexuality; transitioning through education and commencing employment; consolidating advanced cognitive abilities; and negotiating changing relationships with family, peers and broader social connections. The adolescent period is also marked by increased involvement in risk behaviours that may predispose young people to poor long-term outcomes. Many of these risk behaviours are relatively transitory in nature and are resolved by the beginning of adulthood. However, there is increasing evidence of the significant level of emotional and behavioural difficulties such as depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, substance misuse and suicidal thoughts that are experienced by some Australian adolescents.",

The transition from conventional to alternative farming systems literature likewise ignores relevant social barriers to adoption other than profitability. Whether all family members are relevant to adoption, does adoption involve a paradigm shift, do adopters differ fundamentally from conventional farmers, all remain unanswered questions about the social context for adoption. The most obvious social context affecting adoption is the family because family-farm persistence is dependent on the flexible household production form; a unit highly compatible with the varied and seasonal demands of agriculture. Conventional farmers regard sustainable farmers' work habits as lazy or as busy-work generators. A criticism leveled by conventional farmers is that sustainable systems are adopted out of financial desperation.",

      "abstract": "It is clear that the quality of life of the individual is intertwined with that of his or her family. Therefore, health care professionals and other professionals who work with families facing terminal illness must (1) identify those factors that put the patient and the family at risk of suffering further disruption of psychosocial quality of life and (2) seek out whatever resources are necessary to help the patient and the family improve their quality of life. Families with young children are more dependent on external resources than are other families, and they place more strains on the spouse caregiver. If these resources are not available, parents are less able to handle crucial developmental family matters. Clinicians who are aware of this deficit are better able to recognize role performance problems and help families obtain the external resources. Secondly, families who have relied on ascribed roles before the parent fell ill are at greater risk of psychosocial dysfunction: they lack appropriate ways to deal with role reallocation in order to make the best use of their talents. Professionals who are sensitive to this can help families adapt to role changes. A third area that places families at risk is poor spousal communication. Good communication patterns appear to facilitate adjustment to both terminal illness and bereavement (4,6). Professionals trained in family and social therapy are equipped to help family members develop effective communication, which can in turn help them prioritize tasks, seek outside resources when needed, and negotiate role assignments.",

      "abstract": "In the article we’ve shown that the types of parental attitudes towards children predict the essence of adaptive family relationships. It was determined that contradictory and humiliating parenting often causes the formation of an aggressive-protective type of behavior of children with increased excitability and instability; despotic upbringing, in turn, is a passively protective type of behavior with inhibitory reactions, timidity, uncertainty and dependence; overexertion or avoidance facilitate the upbringing of an infantile type of behavior with rather bright affective reactions. It is noted that the implementation of these principles largely depends on the type of family upbringing. These types are: the autocratic type; a democratic type; a liberal type; a chaotic type. The following variants of parental behavior, which determine adaptive or maladaptive family relationships, are singled out: the strict style of parenting, characterized by forceful and directive methods that suppress a child’s initiative, and the explanatory style, which emphasizes reasoning and equality between parent and child. The autonomous style encourages independence by allowing children to make their own decisions, while the compromise style involves collaboration and shared responsibilities. The facilitative style supports active parental involvement and timely assistance, whereas the sympathetic style focuses on emotional empathy without direct intervention. The self-destructive approach prioritizes the child’s comfort at the parents’ expense, and the situational style bases decisions on the specific context without a consistent strategy. Lastly, the dependent style reflects a lack of parental confidence, with reliance on external guidance or delegation of responsibilities. These behavioral patterns significantly affect family dynamics and the child’s social and emotional development, highlighting the critical role of parenting in fostering adaptive relationships and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Juvenile delinquency has historically been responded to by “de‐familization” of the young offender; that is, removal to a training school or other institutional setting. The trend over the past two decades toward deinstitutionalization has meant that delinquent youngsters, who are now remaining in the context of their own communities and families, have been “re‐familized.” This poses a major challenge for the juvenile justice system and community, who are stuck with the family but are not sure what to do about it. Little objective and systematic information is available concerning families of delinquents, either as an aggregate group or in individual cases. It is hypothesized that the families are as heterogeneous as are delinquent youngsters, but the juvenile justice system tends to scapegoat families and assumes they are all necessarily dysfunctional. A 10‐point continuum of family functioning is proposed. It is suggested that families of delinquent youngsters are found at various points on this continuum: from the extremely impaired or criminogenic family, through the family that has serious problems but has something to offer its youngster if it receives effective help with those problems, to the family of average functioning that can serve as a major rehabilitative resource for the youngster.",

Viewing the problem of childhood obesity through a developmental lens is critical to understanding the nuances of a child's interactions with food and their environment across the span of growth and development. Risk factors for childhood obesity begin prior to birth, compounding across the life course. Some significant risk factors are unmodifiable (e.g., genetics) while others are theoretically modifiable. Social inequities, however, hinder many families from easily making modifications to a range of risk factors. The objective of this review is to provide background and an overview of the literature on childhood obesity in early childhood (birth to 5 years of age) in a developmental context. Special focus is placed on unique developmental considerations, child eating behaviors, and parental feeding behaviors in infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool ages.",

Perhaps because of this reason dysfunctional families are particularly noticeable in medical setting, much of the literature on families with children with disability has approached family stress from a deficit model. Successful, adaptive functioning of families with children with disability has not received sufficient attention. In fact, there is a growing body of knowledge, which indicates that the presence of a family member with a disability may contribute to the strengthening of the entire family unit, as well as contribute positively to the quality of life of individual members of the family. Children with supportive parents have fewer problems and also reported positive change in life. These parents, especially mothers used problem-focused coping, religious-faith and denial-blame. They also reported that as coping increases psychological stress decreases. Social factors play important role in coping. Support by others to the mothers of developmentally delayed children act as the facilitators in carrying up the life ahead. Parents especially mothers of developmentally delayed shows high resilient behavior and high quality of the dyadic relationship.",

      "abstract": "The accompanying psychosocial effects of providing care to a parent with AD can alter that caregiver's life in profound ways. A common life dynamic and relationship that is significantly affected by parental caregiving is the sibling relationship. Some sibling relationships are permanently altered and damaged over the course of the caregiving cycle. Four families with multiple siblings and a parent with AD who relied on children for care and continued to live at home were interviewed regarding their sibling relationships and dynamics prior to parental caregiving, during caregiving and after the caregiving process had stopped. Even in a family with multiple siblings, typically one sibling assumes most of the care. Issues of control, resentment, breakdown in communication, sibling rivalry, trust, and different end goals most often disturbed the sibling relationship. During and even after the caregiving experience, altercations and stress levels increased between siblings. In two of the families some siblings ceased some of their relationships and in one family, two siblings stated they will never interact with each other again in a meaningful or trustful manner. Siblings' relationships are often significantly affected during and after the caregiving experience of a parent with AD. The effects of the caregiving process and alteration in sibling dynamics can change this relationship permanently. Siblings need increased therapeutic communication and even therapy and family meetings to survive the caregiving process in a positive and therapeutic manner to keep their relationships intact.",

      "abstract": "Fantasies about the ideal child are likely common to all parents. Most of these fantasies exist in the realm of unformulated experience (Stern, 1997 Stern, D. B. 1997. \"Imagination in Psychoanalysis.\". In Unformulated Experience: From Dissociation to Hillsdale, NY: Analytic Press.. [Google Scholar]), yet they impact how we parent. They affect our expectations of the self as parent and one's child. Disillusionment is part of this process as it contributes to the process whereby the parent comes to terms with who their child is as a unique individual. Thus, inherent in this process is mourning as a parent accepts characteristics in one's child that may not meet a parent's \"ideal\" expectations. The parent needs to be able to cope with this experience and still maintain trust and belief that the child will be able to \"be okay\" and have a satisfactory life even though the child may try different ways of being than the parent would want. This is a normal process of parenting, yet what happens when the disillusionment is so large that the parent becomes too anxious and worried, for example, when the child has a disability, be it emotional, intellectual, or physical? This paper will explore this aspect of parenting and the implications for parents with special needs children. Specifically this paper will explore work with mothers who have children with problems with emotional regulation, significant learning problems, or medical problems; their coming to terms with their child's special needs; and the impact on the mother's self-concept and unresolved conflicts. Thus the focus will be not about \"parenting skills\" but rather about the psychological processes within the mother as she comes to terms with who her child is. This paper is limited to the psychological processes of mothers for purposes of clarity, and this limitation is not in any way intended to minimize or devalue the impact or processes that are occurring in fathers or other members of the family and the dynamics of family life. These other important processes are not addressed as the uniqueness and complexity of each one of these areas warrants a separate paper. Jacobs (2006) Jacobs, L. 2006. Parent-centered work: A relational shift in child treatment.. J. Infant Child Adolescent Psychother., 5: 2262–39. [Google Scholar] notes that \"in recent decades, the influence of attachment theory, relational theories, and infant research has shifted therapeutic focus from a one-person to a two-person psychology. Dyadic relational patterns and the intersubjective nature of experience have assumed prominence in the ways in which analysts conceptualize disturbance and intervention\" (p. 226). Parent centered work has, therefore, become increasingly recognized as an important aspect of treatment with children and adolescents.",

En su parte teorica trata de situar la realidad de estas personas desde un nivel global, como seria su contexto social, hasta el nivel mas concreto de las familias con personas con paralisis cerebral, pasando tambien por recoger algunas caracteristicas de la familia en general y aspectos comunes de las familias de personas con discapacidad. Asi, desde la Teoria de la Actividad, encontramos que la influencia del entorno es decisiva en el comportamiento humano y tiene lugar a traves de diversos factores de dicho entorno. La familia, tambien, desempenara una serie de funciones y socializara en una serie de valores, en funcion de su estilo educativo y del modo en que se desarrolle la vida cotidiana. Ante el nacimiento en la familia de una hija o un hijo con discapacidad podran surgir diversos sentimientos y reacciones e implicara para los padres nuevos roles en relacion a su hijo o hija, enfrentandoles tambien con otros problemas. La paralisis cerebral, por sus caracteristicas especificas, conllevara para los padres una serie de inquietudes, que sera importante tener en cuenta a la hora de realizar algun tipo de intervencion con estas familias. Tal intervencion la concebimos desde la Perspectiva del ciclo vital y consideramos tanto la evaluacion previa a ella, como el plan de intervencion propiamente dicho. Analizamos tambien algunos modelos de intervencion desarrollados en la practica. Los objetivos del trabajo experimental son analizar los sucesos vitales mas influyentes en las personas estudiadas (adultos jovenes con Paralisis Cerebral y sus padres) y las estrategias empleadas por ellas para afrontarlos, lo cual puede contribuir a elaborar las bases para un programa de intervencion con las familias. La metodologia utilizada fue, en primer lugar, la entrevista a varias personas con esta discapacidad, a las que se les preguntaba por los sucesos vitales mas influyentes en sus vidas. Sus respuestas dieron pie a situarnos en la Teoria de los constructos personales y a la elaboracion de una rejilla consensuada con el fin de recoger la forma en que las personas con Paralisis Cerebral de nuestro estudio, sus madres y padres construyen su estructuracion cognitiva personal. La anamnesis de cada una de las personas con Paralisis Cerebral nos ayudo a reconstruir los datos mas significativos de sus historias personales. Las respuestas dadas por cada una de ellas, sus madres y padres, fueron analizadas estadisticamente con el Programa Winsigrid. Con todos los datos obtenidos en el trabajo de campo hicimos un doble estudio comparativo, por un lado analizamos las convergencias y divergencias dentro de cada nucleo familiar y por otro consideramos tres grupos diferentes, personas con Paralisis Cerebral, madres y padres, estudiando los aspectos mas importantes de cada uno de estos grupos especificos. Este trabajo nos permitio llegar a una serie de conclusiones acerca de las percepciones, actitudes, preocupaciones, recursos y angustias de estas personas ante sus sucesos vitales y de la influencia de determinados aspectos del entorno y de sus propias experiencias personales en todo ello. Por ultimo recopilamos una serie de caracteristicas que consideramos deberia tener un programa de intervencion con estas familias, asi como una serie de estrategias de intervencion que pensamos deberian tener en cuenta los profesionales que realizaran tal intervencion.",

      "title": "Implementation of social partnership technology in the prevention of family disadvantages",
      "abstract": "Currently, there are different types of dysfunctional families: conflictual, immoral, pedagogically untenable, asocial. The causes of family disadvantages may be crisis phenomena in the socio-economic sphere, disorder of intra-family relations between parents and children, physically or mentally ill parents, unfavorable heredity in children, or presence of children or adults with disabilities in the family. Prevention of family disadvantages implies a set of measures to work with parents and children in order to form and maintain normal family relations, focus on a healthy lifestyle, and revive the institution of family and marriage. There are various ways to organize effective work in this direction, but the most effective is the implementation of social partnership technology. Such a partnership can be implemented through the interaction of various social institutions, such as social protection management bodies and social protection institutions, education management bodies and educational institutions, commissions for minors and for protection of their rights, special institutions for minors in need of social rehabilitation, guardianship and custody authorities, health management bodies and health care institutions, internal affairs bodies, bodies, institutions, and public associations, implementing measures to prevent neglect and juvenile delinquency, etc. Within the framework of social partnership technology, specialists of these institutions can ensure the prevention of family disadvantages more successfully and effectively by creating a unified concept of joint actions in relation to a particular family. Also, the implementation of social partnership technology will allow for the exchange of information characterizing the situation of families and children in the subordinate territory that is necessary for carrying out activities in their interests with authorities, state and non-governmental institutions, organizations and services.",

      "abstract": "Binnen de residentiele jeugdinstellingen (justitieel of jeugdzorg) verblijven jongeren veelal gezamenlijk op leefgroepen, waarbij zij worden begeleid door pedagogisch medewerkers. De meeste gesloten geplaatste jongeren kampen met gedragsproblemen, veelal in combinatie met complexe onderliggende problemen op bijvoorbeeld op sociaal-emotioneel, cognitief en sociaal vlak (zoals familie gerelateerde problemen). Veel jongeren hebben een beperkte spanningsboog en er is een hoge prevalentie Licht Verstandelijk Beperkten (LVB) onder de populatie of ervaren moeilijkheden met lezen en het begrijpen van complexe vragen.\r\nOndanks de individuele verschillen en de moeilijkheden in het diagnosticeren van de jongeren, hebben zij in elk geval een aantal dingen gemeen: ze kunnen de leefgroepen niet zelfstandig verlaten en er is sprake van een vastgestelde dagelijkse routine waar ze in mee dienen te draaien en verplichte behandeling. Het leven in een residentiele instelling heeft daarmee een grote impact op de privacy beleving en bewegings- en keuzevrijheid van de jongeren. De specifieke achtergrondkenmerken en karaktereigenschappen van de jongeren maken dat elke jongere verschillend reageert op het opgesloten zijn. Op de leefgroep is er hierdoor sprake van een bijzondere sociale situatie, waarin zowel jongeren als groepsleiders constant op elkaar reageren. Om het leefklimaat en verschillende aspecten van het leefklimaat te meten, is de Prison Group Climate Instrument (PGCI) ontwikkeld (Van der Helm, Stams, & Van der Laan, 2011). De PGCI is een versie van de vragenlijst ontwikkeld voor volwassenen in forensische instellingen, maar wordt inmiddels ook in residentiele jeugdzorg veelvuldig gebruikt. Een versie van de vragenlijst onder de naam GCI (Group Climate Instrument) is geschikt voor jongeren tussen de 12 en 18 jaar. Er zijn ook versies van de vragenlijst voor kinderen van 4 tot 8 jaar en van 8 tot 14 jaar: de GCIC (Group Climate Instrument for Children). De vragenlijst voor jongeren tussen 8 tot 14 jaar is overigens beter geschikt voor jongeren met LVB-problematiek.",

      "title": "Adoptive parenting from adolescence to early adulthood",
      "abstract": "Parenting can be challenging at any stage, but when a child goes through adolescence the many physical, emotional, social and cognitive changes mean these challenges are likely to be magnified. The many changes create increasing opportunities for young people to begin exploring their social roles and identity, as well as the rights and the responsibilities that come with those. Whilst the young people are experimenting during this transition, parents may need to provide supervision whilst simultaneously encouraging autonomy and remaining flexible. Parenting is a dynamic process that involves complex interactions between the parent, the young person and their environment. These factors influence the level of responsiveness and supervision provided by a parent in response to their child’s or adolescent’s needs and situation. Within the adoptive family, adolescents can provide an additional level of complexity. Existing literature suggests this is a time of vulnerability in adoptive placements, a time when adoptions are at high risk of placement breakdown. This systematic review explores the literature on the distinctive features of parenting an adopted adolescent. Two main themes were highlighted: parental responsiveness and supervision, and communicative openness, defined as the level of adoption-relevant discussion within an adoptive family. Parental responsiveness was important for adopted adolescents because it allows parents to support adolescent emotional, behavioural and social outcomes, as well as reducing family conflict. Open communication about adoption was found to reduce conflict and increase emotional well-being. Research suggests that being highly attuned and responsive to the young adoptees is linked to greater adoption-related open communication and better outcomes during adolescence.   Traditionally, much of the research regarding adoption has focused on negative outcomes. In recent years, however, the literature has begun to move from risk to resilience (Ferrari, Ranieri, Barni & Rosnati, 2015). Sonuga-Barke, Kennedy, Kumsta, Knights, Golm, Rutter, Maughan, Schlotz and Kreppner (2017) assessed the prevalence of neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes associated with early deprivation and their persistence into young adulthood. They found that children adopted after six months of age (high risk) had persistently higher levels of neurodevelopmental difficulties and poor life outcomes. The current study utilised longitudinal data from the ERA study (Rutter et al., 1998) to examine if communicative openness during adolescence and associated parenting behaviours, including parental responsiveness and experience of parental adoption journey, predicted the development of resilience in a group of young people from an at-risk sample. The main findings indicated that there were important relationships between aspects of communicative openness, parental responsiveness and parental journey. In addition, the young person’s difficulty discussing their adoption and how and when information was disclosed, were factors relating to the development of resilience from infancy to adulthood. Parental responsiveness and the young person’s own positivity at age four to six years was also related to higher levels of resilience, as was evaluations of adoption, which was found to be stable between each assessment phase. Only higher levels of the young person’s difficulty discussing their adoption at age 15 and higher negative evaluations of adoption significantly predicted/contributed to lower levels of resilience in early adulthood. Lower levels of resilience were associated with poorer educational, emotional and employment outcomes.",

      "title": "Differences in health and well-being of parents of children with disabilities",
      "abstract": "When a child with a disability is born, reaction of most parents, regardless of gender, span a range of feelings, starting from denial, shock, anger to, hopefully, at last, reconciliation with the circumstances. Different research studies have shown that most of such parents experience increased levels of stress and extended responsibility due to their new situation, and gender differences do determine the experience and reaction to the situation and also the health and well-being of those affected. Women tend to be more affected by stressful life events in general than men, especially when these events affect individuals with whom they have a relationship, such as family members. Women also report a decreased sense of control in stressful situations*they experience more psychological distress and depression and they tend to use more emotion-focused coping-strategies than men such as verbalizing the problems and seeking support from others. Mothers of children with disabilities experience a higher level of stress and depression than fathers. It has been proven that the depressive symptoms of the mothers increase with the age of the child. This is related to the expectance of the child’s need for care. A younger child is expected to require more care than an older child, having a disability or not. Mothers of children with disabilities also report a higher rate of marital dissatisfaction while the same does not apply to their fathers. The more severe the mother’s subjective perception of the child’s disability, the higher the rate of marital discord reported, which is probably because the more severe the child’s disability, the more time the mother has to spend with the child, leaving very little time left to be spent with her spouse.

Familism--defined here as direct caregiving provided by family members to the person with mental retardation, mothers' social support networks, and mothers' obligations to other family members--was hypothesized to account for variation in maternal well-being. Better maternal well-being was predicted by larger social support networks, greater satisfaction with social support, and more minor children living in the household. A troubling but not unexpected finding is that these mothers faced many socioeconomic challenges and were in poor health in addition to the challenges of parenting a child with mental retardation.",

These divorce experience dimensions were not highly intercorrelated and are described in detail. These divorce experience dimensions were also related to a variety of mother- and child-oriented factors. Mothers' positive divorce adjustment was related to nontraditional sex role attitudes, a marriage of short duration, few working hours, and the wife's initiating the divorce. Long-term prediction of divorce adjustment was made by clusters of personality traits assessed 2 years previously; these included Personal Competence, Self-concern, Extroversion/Sociability, and particularly Social Maturity. Mothers' post-separation stress, parental conflict in the post-separation period, and high degrees of environmental change occasioned by the divorce were related to children's social and psychological maladjustment.",

The growth in the population entering late old age has important implications for social work. Social work with older people, in the circumstances, is often inseparable from help in the context of bereavement and assisting people through the process of rebuilding their lives and social networks. Social work inevitably engages with older people during periods of crisis and loss. But it is also important to highlight the continued involvement of older people within their community. Ageism may be defined as discrimination against older people merely by virtue of their age. Ageism affects many institutions in society and has a number of dimensions – job discrimination, loss of status, stereotyping and dehumanization.",

      "title": "Reflective Partnership Between an Adult and a Child in Institutional Foster Care – in Search of (the Child's) Agency",
      "abstract": "Though undergoing changes for a decade, the foster care system in Poland is still dominated by the adult model of childhood management. Assuming that the biological, psychological and social immaturity of children precludes their autonomy, this model expects adults to focus on control over the integration of a child into society. A consequence is the instrumentalisation of childhood and the deprivation of a child's sense of agency, i.e., the right to (co-)create one's own life space. Additionally, the foster care system concentration on adult problems relegates children to the background. Treatment of children as the object of adult interactions significantly impedes approaches that could empower, reduces chances for relationships built on dialogue, limits a child's openness and authenticity and hinders development of his/her identity structure and resourcefulness. Such institutionalised systems do not satisfy a child's needs, especially unconditional acceptance, enjoyment of life, and self-fulfilment. Instead, from the child's perspective, residential/foster care is a traumatic experience that deprives a human being of childhood. Such an institutional experience interferes in the acquisition of functional patterns for adulthood, reinforces traumas, and denies a chance to reclaim one's childhood. Research conducted with children indicates a need for a change in direction. The aim herein is to show the current situation of children in the Polish foster care system, identify threats to the development of an autonomous identity, and present an alternative, child-centred foster care model in which the caregiver treats the child as a competent person.",

      "title": "The Role of the Family in Preventing the Transformation of Western Youngsters into <i>Jihadi</i> Fighters",
      "abstract": "Abstract The mother–child relationship is essential in the development of a healthy child, who can grow up trusting his/her own perceptions and understanding of the social environment. Teenagers naturally experience a period of transition in search of their own identity as individuals, thus being really exposed and vulnerable to being recruited by jihadists. In this particular stage of development, the teenager tries to free himself/herself from the tutorship of the family and looks to experience something new outside the family frame. One of the defining characteristics of this stage is a tendency to take things to an extreme and to see things in black and white, while emotions are experienced as very intense, overwhelming and sometimes difficult to control. Teenagers are easy to impress, convince and manipulate, especially by their social milieu outside the family of origin. In the cases when the relationship with the family of origin becomes tensed – whether the child has been neglected or spoiled during childhood, or when there are tensions between parents or the family is conflicting – the teenager looks for validation outside the family environment. Any opportunity to do something out of the ordinary and apparently easy to accomplish might seem attractive for this category of individuals, especially for those that do not enjoy family support. The illusion of becoming famous or the attraction of glamour might seem desirable at this age. This is one of the main reasons why Jihad has had such a significant impact on Western converts to Islam. Therefore, the aim of this study is to provide an analysis of the case of Boicea Luigi Constantin (Umar al Rumaani), a Romanian that adhered to the extremist ideology of the Islamic State, who does not come from a Muslim family, yet underwent a fast self-radicalization process. In order to better understand Boicea’s case, we will try to present the result of the investigation conducted on the family environment, his interests manifested at an early age, and the tragic events that contributed to his radicalization; in other words, we will try to present the general context in which self-radicalization occurred.",

The examples above are just some of the whole lot of factors that lead to increased stress and tension in the family and it can result in a change of emotional reactions to the stimuli created in the family. Divorce affects child development very differently depending on many variables: age at the moment of separation, the sex of the child, the reason of the parents´ divorce, nature and frequency of conflicts in the family, the children´s role in these conflicts, the relationship with the custodial parent and the absent one, any some chronic diseases (of children or parents), changing social status.",

Adolescents 10 to 18 years old (N = 522) were interviewed by telephone 4 1/2 years after their parents' separation. Feeling caught between parents was related to high parental conflict and hostility and low parental cooperation. Being close to both parents was associated with low feelings of being caught. The relation between time spent with each parent and feeling caught depended on the coparenting relationship. Adolescents in dual residence were especially likely to feel caught when parents were in high conflict, and especially unlikely to feel caught when parents cooperated. Feeling caught was related to poor adjustment outcomes. Parental conflict was only related to adjustment outcomes indirectly, through adolescents' feelings of being caught.",

When bereaved parents give birth to a child or children subsequent to a perinatal death, their constructions of the family necessarily change. The subsequent child is thought to be at risk of psychopathology (the replacement child syndrome) if parents have not sufficiently grieved their losses. This qualitative interview study examines the family stories told by bereaved parents, with particular attention to how parents represent the dead child and subsequent children in the current family structure. We categorized parents' stories as those which suggested that parents replaced the loss by an emphasis on parenting subsequent children, or maintained a connection to the dead child through storytelling and ritual behavior. The two ways in which parents maintained the connection were to preserve the space in the family that the dead child would have inhabited, or to create an on-going relationship with the dead child for themselves and their subsequent children. There seem to be multiple paths to parenting through bereavement. The place of rituals and memorial behavior is also examined.",

The findings from the country-level fixed-effect models show that whereas the difference between type-of-father households is negligible, the gap between type-of-mother households is significantly larger, particularly, in non-marital cohabitations. The findings are more pronounced for the division of physical (e.g. taking care of child when sick) than interactive (e.g. helping child with homework) tasks. The proposition is put forward that these findings stem from the higher ambiguity which surrounds the parenting role of step-mothers compared to that of step-fathers.",

Three categories of change were defined: (a) no change, (b) minor change (changing the schedule of visits or residence with a parent), and (c) major change (changing the custody arrangement). The results show that a minority of children changed custody arrangement but almost half the children in joint custody changed custody arrangements during the two years of the study. More young children and more girls changed custody arrangements, and girls who changed custody usually went to their mothers. With time, a type of polarization may be observed toward sole custody because there were less parents truly active in child custody at T2 than at Tl.",

Al aplicar la Escala de Resiliencia Mexicana (RESI-M) a 401 padres de pacientes atendidos en el CRIT Hidalgo, se encontro un nivel global de resiliencia moderado en los padres. Se registraron mayores porcentajes, incluidos en un nivel alto, en las areas de apoyo familiar y social. Los menores porcentajes se registraron en las areas de competencia social y estructura.

      "abstract": "Summary At the end of the infant stage, children experiment a progressive development which is linked to the establishment of feeding habits. This period of life, since preschool until the prepuberty stage is characterized by a slow growth with an annual increase of 2 to 3 kg of weight and 5 to 8 cm of stature. As velocity of growth decreases during this period of life, the appetite also diminishes and food intake seems to be irregular or unpredictable. Parents frequently express their worries about the limited variety of ingested foods, the lost of time, distraction and scarce consumption of vegetables and meat, and the preference for candies and sweet foods. In the second spurt of growth, during puberty, the demand of nutrients increase again along with appetite, and eventually some eating disorders might appear as a product of psycho-affective problems in the family and social environment. Personnel on charge (parents, teachers and health professionals) are responsible for providing a variety of nutritious food, structured meal times, and an environment that facilitates feeding and social exchange. Children in these stages of life have the responsibility to determine how much they should",

The bereaved are compared with two control groups: one declaring no significant change in their life and the other reporting a loss unrelated to bereavement. Results show that the death of a significant other has no impact on the measures of functional and physical health, nor is it a factor of isolation. However, the loss of a close relative is associated with more depressive symptoms while that of a relative or friend is related to the survivor's feeling of loneliness.",

Given the extensive supportive roles played by adult children, this increase in adults without children has implications for social policy and social work practice. Social integration patterns are examined among four groups: no children (N = 237), no proximal children (N = 436), one proximal child (N = 701), and two or more proximal children (N = 531). Findings show elders without children are older, female, black, unmarried, living alone with lower incomes and more physical health problems than their counterparts.

      "abstract": "Mental illness is one of the most disturbing life events that a family can experience. Understanding and treating mental illness outside the familiar context is denying that the disease leads to profound changes in the family system. When working with a child/adolescent population and their families, it is noted that, in many of them, there is a mental illness of one of the parents. Often, parents seek to hide diseases to children, as if they were not aware of their suffering, interpreting it as a fatal disease, emerging strong fears of loss/death of the sick parent. Depending on their age and cognitive and emotional development children create their own interpretations of the disease and sometimes question the love of parents for them, because they feel “abandoned”. Children express their incomprehension regarding parental behaviors (deep sadness, aggressiveness, unpredictability, negligence ...), fear them or take responsibility for their behaviors.Family therapy is a fundamental contribution for intervention, allowing the family to adapt to a new reality and find a new balance. In addition to understanding the relational patterns and help the family finding strategies to deal with the patient’s behavior, it is essential to work the relationship of sick fatherchildren, to work the meaning children attach to mental illness, the new roles they assume in the family and the construction of new narratives of mental illness.",

      "title": "CONTINUITY OF LEARNING: adding funds of knowledge from the home environment",
      "abstract": "In comparison to previous generations, families these days are leading increasingly complex lives. Children often have a diversity of experiences from various learning communities before they begin school. For example, they may have been involved in one or more early childhood settings before moving on to school, where they join the new community of the school; and they have the of the home community, which may or may not involve an extended family. They may be involved in cultural, sporting, artistic, and/or spiritual communities. A child may be involved in many communities each week, or may a number of different communities over a period of time. This can be referred to as the multidimensionality of student experience (Gonzalez, Moll, & Amanti, 2005, p. 6). Some of these communities may be very similar to each other--for example, involvement in a spiritual community may in many ways require of activities similar to those practised at home. Some communities may be very disparate; for example, a swimming lesson may operate very differently from a play group and have a different set of expectations and modes of participation. The constant factor, however, is the mediating one of the family. This article explores the families have of their child and the importance for teachers, families, and the child of sharing this knowledge. Funds of In their book Funds of Knowledge Norma Gonzales, Luis Moll, and Cathy Amanti define of knowledge as being based on a simple premise: People are competent, they have knowledge, and their life experiences have given them that knowledge (2005, p. ix). Gonzales et al. focus on developing reciprocal relationships with families, in part to identify the knowledge, skills, and experiences of families that could be shared with the to enhance classroom practice and students' learning: [a] funds of approach facilitates a systematic and powerful way to represent communities in terms of resources, the wherewithal they possess, and how to harness these resources for classroom teachers (p. x). As well as viewing a family's skills and as resources the teacher can tap into, it is also possible to see the family as a mediating factor in terms of the child's interactions with the various learning communities the child is involved in (as shown in Figure 1). This view highlights the necessity of developing reciprocal and responsive relationships between the family and the centre or classroom. In this framework the family can be seen as a pivotal point and constant frame of reference for the child. At any one time a child is a participant in many communities, not just one. It is the family, as the mediating factor, that has the of the child's of these things. Communities of practice When we look more closely at the child's of, and between, these communities, a useful concept is Etienne Wenger's (1998) definition of a community of practice as a living context that can give newcomers access to competence and also invite a personal of engagement by which to incorporate that competence into an identity of (p. 214). Children come to an early childhood centre or school with varying experiences of participation. Each of the communities they have been a part of may have functioned in entirely different ways, with a multitude of different foci. How they have approached these different settings and how their sense of belonging, engagement, and participation has developed are important indicators for a teacher in deciding how to scaffold and bridge a child's entry into, and learning within, any community of learning. Once again, it is often the family that holds this information. Reciprocal relationships In their exploration of funds of Gonzales et al.

      "title": "Resilience across the Continuum of Care",
      "abstract": "Who Are Carers? A carer is any individual who provides unpaid care and support to a family member or friend who has a disability, mental illness, drug and/or alcohol dependency, chronic condition, terminal illness or who is frail. Carers come from all walks of life, cultural backgrounds and age groups. For many, caring is a 24 hour-a-day job with emotional, physical and financial impacts, with implications for their participation in employment, education and community activities. Carers exist in all communities, including amongst Aboriginal communities, those of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, amongst Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex communities, and throughout metropolitan, regional and rural areas (Carers NSW). These broad characteristics mean that caring occurs across a wide variety of situations and care responsibilities can impact an even wider group of people. The ubiquitous nature of informal care warrants its consideration as a major social issue, as well as the potential impacts that these roles can have on carers in both short and long term contexts. Caring for a loved one is often an unseen component of people’s domestic lives. As will be outlined below, the potentially burdensome nature of care can have negative influences on carers’ wellbeing. As such, factors that can enhance the resilience of carers in the face of such adversity have been widely investigated. This being said, individual differences exist in carers’ responses to their caring responsibilities. The caring experience can therefore be argued to exist on a continuum, from the adversity in relation to stressful challenges through to prosperity in light of their caring responsibilities. By considering the experience of care as existing along this continuum, the place of resilience within people’s domestic spaces can be viewed as a mechanism towards identifying and developing supportive practices. Negative Impacts of Care A significant body of research has identified potential negative impacts of caring. Many of the most commonly cited outcomes relate to negative effects on mental health and/or psychological functioning, including stress, anxiety and depression (e.g. Baker et al.; Barlow, Cullen-Powell and Cheshire; Cheshire, Barlow and Powell; Dunn et al.; Gallagher et al.; Hastings et al.; Lach et al.; Singer; Sörensen et al.; Vitaliano, Zhang and Scanlan; Whittingham et al.; Yamada et al.). These feelings can be exacerbated when caring responsibilities become relentlessly time consuming, as demonstrated by this comment from a carer of a person with dementia: “I can’t get away from it” (O'Dwyer, Moyle and van Wyk 758). Similarly, emotional responses such as sorrow, grief, anger, frustration, and guilt can result from caring for a loved one (Heiman; Whittingham et al.). Negative emotional responses are not necessarily a direct result of caring responsibilities as such, but an understanding of the challenges faced by the person requiring their care. The following quote from the carer of a child with autism exemplifies the experience of sorrow: “It was actually the worst day of our lives, that was the day we came to terms with the fact that we had this problem” (Midence and O’Neill 280). Alongside these psychological and emotional outcomes, physical health may also be negatively impacted due to certain demands of the caring role (Lach et al.; Sörensen et al.; Vitaliano, Zhang and Scanlan). Outcomes such as these are likely to vary across individual caring circumstances, dictated by variables such as the specific tasks required of the carer, and individual personality characteristics of both the carer and the person for whom they care. Nevertheless, an awareness of these potential outcomes is particularly important when considering the place of resilience in the domestic space of individuals caring for a loved one. This conceptualisation of caring as being a burdensome task reflects many publicly held perceptions. If caring is widely viewed as compromising carers’ wellbeing, then there is likely to be an increased likelihood of carers viewing themselves as victims. This is particularly true amongst children and adolescents with caring responsibilities, since young people are most susceptible to having their personal identities shaped by others’ perceptions (Andreouli, Skovdal and Campbell). Resilience in Caring Adversity Despite the widely acknowledged potential for caring to have negative consequences for carers, it must be noted that the occurrence of these outcomes are not inevitable. In fact, much of the research that has identified increased stress amongst carers also finds that the majority cope well with the demands of their role (Barnett et al.). These carers have been considered by many researchers to demonstrate resilience (e.g. Barnett et al.; O'Dwyer, Moyle and van Wyk). The ability to respond positively despite exposure to risk or adversity is a key feature of most definitions of resilience (Luthar, Cicchetti and Becker; Masten and Obradović; Zauszniewski, Bekhet and Suresky). Resilience in this context can thus be defined as a psychological process that facilitates healthy functioning in response to intense life stressors (Johnson et al.). Since caring experiences are likely to continue for an extended period of time, resilience is likely to be necessary on an ongoing basis, rather than in response to a single traumatic event. A resilient carer is therefore one who is able to effectively and adaptively cope with extenuating pressures of caring for a loved one. This involves the presence of personal, social, familial, or institutional protective factors that enable carers to resist stress (Kaplan et al.). For example, support from health professionals, family, or community has been found to effectively support carers in coping with their role (Bekhet, Johnson and Zauszniewski; Gardiner and Iarocci; Heiman; Whittingham et al.). The benefit of support networks in assisting carers to cope in their role is widely reported in the associated research, reinforced by many examples such as the following from a carer of a person with dementia: “It’s a social thing, like, I’ve got friends on there… I find that is my escape” (O'Dwyer, Moyle and van Wyk 758). At an individual level, those who demonstrate resilient in the face of adversity demonstrate optimistic or hopeful outlooks (Ekas, Lickenbrock and Whitman; Lloyd and Hastings; Whittingham et al.), while simultaneously holding realistic expectations of the future (Rasmussen et al.; Wrosch, Miller, et al.; Wrosch, Scheier, et al.). Such attitudes are particularly significant amongst people caring for family members or friends with disabilities or illnesses. The following attitude held by a carer of a child with cerebral palsy exemplifies this optimistic outlook: “I look at the glass half full and say that “well, it’s only his walking, everything else is fine”. “So, get over [it] and deal with it” (Whittingham et al. 1451). Those who cognitively process information, rather than reacting in a highly emotion way have also been found to cope better (Bekhet, Johnson and Zauszniewski; Heiman; Monin et al.; Pennebaker, Mayne and Francis), as have those with a greater sense of self-efficacy or an internal locus of control (Bekhet, Johnson and Zauszniewski; Kuhn and Carter). However effective these coping strategies prove to be, this is unlikely to provide the full picture of caring experiences, or the place of resilience within that space. Associating resilience with adversity presumes a consensus on what constitutes adversity. Taking the typical approach to investigating resilience amongst carers risks making undue assumptions of the nature of individual carers’ experiences – namely, that caring equates to adversity. The following paragraphs will outline how this is not necessarily the case. And furthermore, that the concept of resilience still has a place in considering informal caring, regardless of whether adversity is considered to be present. Benefits of Care While a great deal of evidence suggests that caring for a loved one can be a stressful experience, research has also demonstrated the existence of positive impacts of care. In many instances, carers not only cope, but also thrive in their caring roles (Turnbull et al.). Elements such as positive relationships within caring relationships can both challenge and strengthen individuals – factors that only exist due to the specific nature of the individual caring role (Bayat; Heiman). Such positive elements of the caring experience have been reflected in the literature, illustrated by quotes such as: “In some sense, this makes our family closer” (Bayat 709). Rather than viewing carers from a perspective of victimisation (which is particularly prominent in relation to children and young people with caring responsibilities), recognising the prevalence of positive wellbeing within this population provides a more nuanced understanding of the lived experiences of all carers (Aldridge). Reported benefits of caring tend to revolve around personal relationships, particularly in reference to parents caring for their children with special needs. Reflective of the parental relationship, carers of children with disabilities or chronic illnesses generally report feelings of love, joy, optimism, strength, enjoyment, and satisfaction with their role (Barnett et al.; Heiman). The views of such carers do not reflect an attitude of coping with adversity, but rather a perspective that considers their children to be positive contributors to carers’ quality of life and the wellbeing of the wider family (King et al.). This point of view suggests an additional dimension to resilience; in particular, that resilience in the relative absence of risk factors, can cause carers to flourish within their caring role and relationships. In addition to benefits in relationships, carers may also prosper through their own personal growth and development in the course of their caring (Knight). This includes factors such as the development of life skills, maturity, purpose, social skills, a sense of responsibility, and recognition – particularly amongst young people in caring roles (Earley, Cushway and Cassidy; Early, Cushway and Cassidy; Jurkovic, Thirkield and Morrell; Skovdal and Andreouli; Stein, Rotheram-Borus and Lester; Tompkins). Recognition of the potential personal benefits of caring for a loved one is not intended to suggest that the view of carers coping with adversity is universally applicable. While it is likely that individual caring situations will have an impact on the extent to which a carer faces adversity (e.g. intensity of caring responsibilities, severity of loved one’s impairment, etc.), it is important to recognise the benefits that carers can experience alongside any challenges they may face. Circumstances that appear adversarial may not be thought of as such by those within that context. Defining resilience as an ability to cope with adversity therefore will not apply to such contexts. Rather, the concept of resilience needs to incorporate those who not only cope, but also prosper. Carers who do not perceive their role as burdensome, but identify positive outcomes, can therefore be said to demonstrate resilience though contextually different from those coping with adversity. This is not to suggest that resilience is the sole contributing factor in terms of prospering in the caring role. We must also consider individual circumstances and nuances differ between carers, those they care for, interpersonal relationships, and wider caring situations. Continuum of Care Awareness of the range of impacts that caring can have on carers leads to a recognition of the broad spectrum of experience that this role entails. Not only do caring experiences exhibit large variations in terms of practical issues (such as functional capacities, or type and severity of illness, disability, or condition), they include carers’ diverse personal responses to caring responsibilities. These responses can reflect either positive or negative dimensions, or a combination of both (Faso, Neal-Beevers and Carlson). In this way, caring experiences can be conceptualised as existing along a continuum. At one end of the spectrum, experiences align with the traditional view of caring as a struggle with and over adversity. More specifically, carers experience burdens as a result of their additional caring responsibilities, with negative outcomes likely to occur. At the other end of the spectrum, however, carers prosper in the role, experiencing significant personal benefits that would not have been possible without the caring role. This continuum makes a case for an expanded approach to stress and coping models of resilience to include positive concepts and a benefit-orientated perspective (Cassidy and Giles). In contrast to research that has argued for a progression from stress and coping models to strengths-based approaches (e.g. Glidden, Billings and Jobe; Knight), the continuum of care acknowledges the benefits of each of these theoretical positions, and thus may prove more comprehensive in attempting to understand the everyday lived experiences of carers. The framework provided by a representation of a continuum allows for the individual differences in caring situations and carers’ personal responses to be acknowledged, as well as accounting for any changes in these circumstances. Further, the experience and benefits of resilience in different contextual spheres can be identified. The flexibility afforded by such an approach is particularly important in light of individual differences in the ways carers respond to their situations, their changing caring contexts, and their subsequent individual needs (Monin et al.; Walsh; Whittingham et al.). As the caring experience can be dynamic and fluctuate in both directions along the continuum, resilience may be seen as the mechanism by which such movement occurs. In line with stress and coping models, resilience can assist carers to cope with adversarial circumstances at that end of the continuum. Similarly, it may be argued that those who prosper in their caring role exhibit characteristics of resilience. In other words, it is resilience that enables carers to cope with adversity at one end of the continuum and also to prosper at the other. Furthermore, by supporting the development of resilient characteristics, carers may be assisted in shifting their experiences along the continuum, from adversity to prosperity. This view extends upon traditional approaches reported in the stress and coping literature by contending that caring experiences may progress beyond positions of coping with adversity, to a position where caring is not understood in terms of adversity at all, but rather in terms of benefits. The individual circumstances of any carer must be taken into consideration with this framework of resilience and the continuum of care. It is unrealistic to assume that all caring situations will allow for the possibility of reaching the end point of this continuum. Carers with particularly high demands in terms of time, resources, effort, or energy may not reach a stage where they no longer consider their caring role to involve any personal burden. However, the combination of a coping and strengths-based approach suggests that there is always the possibility of moving away from perceptions of adversity and further towards an attitude of prosperity. Implications for Supportive Practice From the perspective of this continuum of care, the protective factors and coping strategies identified in previous literature provide a valuable starting point for the facilitation of resilience amongst carers. Enhancing factors such as these can assist carers to move from situations of adversity towards experiences of prosperity (Benzies and Mychasiuk). Research has suggested that carers who are less analytical in their thinking and less optimistic about their personal situations may find particular benefit from support systems that assist them in redirecting their attention towards positive aspects of their daily lives, such as the benefits of caring outlined earlier (Monin et al.). The principle of focusing on positive experiences and reframing negative thoughts is thought to benefit carers across all levels of functioning and adaptive experience (Monin et al.). While those entrenched in more burdensome mindsets are likely to experience the greatest benefit from supportive interventions, there is still merit in providing similar supports to carers who do not appear to experience the similar experiences of burden, or demonstrate greater resilience or adaptation to their situation. The dynamic view of caring situations and resilience suggested by a continuum of care incorporates benefits of stress and coping models as well as strengths-based approaches. This has implications for supportive practice in that the focus is not on determining whether or not a carer is resilient, but identifying the ways in which they already are resilient (Simon, Murphy and Smith). For carers who experience their role through a lens of adversity, resilience may need to be purposefully fostered in order to better enable them to cope and develop through the ongoing stresses of their role. For carers at the other end of the spectrum, resilience is likely to take on a substantially different meaning. Under these circumstances, caring for a loved one is not considered a burdensome task; rather, the positive impact of the role is pre-eminent. This point of view suggests that carers are resilient, not only in terms of an ability to thrive despite adversity, but in prospering to the extent that adversity is not considered to exist. The attitudes and approaches of services, support networks, and governments towards carers should remain flexible enough to acknowledge the wide variety of caring circumstances that exist. The continuum of care provides a framework through which certain aspects of caring and variations in resilience can be interpreted, as well as the type of support required by individual carers. Furthermore, it must be noted that caring circumstances can change – either gradually or suddenly – with the extent to which carers experience adversity, coping or prosperity also changing. Any attempts to provide support to carers or acknowledge their resilience should demonstrate an awareness of the potential for such fluctuation. The fundamental view that carers always have the potential to move towards more positive outcomes has the potential to reframe perceptions of carers as victims, or as simply coping, to one that embraces the personal strengths and resilience of the individual. As such, carers can be supported when faced with adversity, and to flourish beyond that position. This in turn has the potential to safeguard against any detrimental effects of adversity that may arise in the future. References Aldridge, Jo. \"All Work and No Play?

These children need nurturing care to develop organized attachments to caregivers; they need synchronous care to support their physiological and behavioral regulation; and they need stable caregivers who can commit to them, supporting their sense of self and behavioral regulation. Without intervention at the level of the parent and the system, most children involved with the child welfare system are unlikely to have these needs met. We present two models of intervention designed to enhance parents' synchrony and nurturance, and highlight aspects of the system that can enhance the stability and commitment of caregivers.",

      "abstract": "Families without homes are the fastest‐growing segment of the homeless population and are a vulnerable and underserved group. Structural (e.g., availability of affordable housing) and psychosocial factors that contribute to homelessness at the family, community, and policy levels are highly complex and interwoven. Episodes of homelessness typically follow cumulative risks such as extreme poverty, partner violence, child maltreatment, neighborhood violence, and/or family separations. The loss of a home can create additional stress for fragile families as they live in cars, parks, and other dangerous locations or as they reside in shelters that can inadvertently retraumatize family members. A two‐generational approach to service delivery is optimal to address the complex needs of parents as well as their children. Mental health and public health professionals must consider these circumstances and offer an integrated and comprehensive range of service options to best serve families experiencing homelessness.",

Neither therapists' birth orders nor the size of the families in which they grew up shows any significant association with the four dimensions of adult personal self, so it seems that family structure was not a significant influence. Therapists who viewed their family's emotional and psychological functioning as good or very good tended to be significantly more Genial/Caring and less Ardent/Expressive; that is, more loving but less loud in expressing it. The therapist's childhood family economic status was significantly associated with their adult marital/relationship status, but not their parental status. Family religious background was significantly associated both with therapists' adult relationship status and the parental status.",

This qualitative phenomenological study is theoretically grounded in family systems theory. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Latinx youth ( n = 8) and their remaining caregivers, specifically mothers ( n = 8) who had recently experienced the deportation of the child’s father. Findings from the analysis revealed that following the deportation of a parent, families (a) modified family structures and relied upon extended familial support, (b) experienced familial tensions, (c) experienced financial difficulties and housing instability, and (d) retreated from social life, including drastically shrinking social networks. Implications for practice include developing culturally based, trauma-informed interventions for Latinx families affected by deportation.",

      "abstract": "Shared residence after divorce is rising in most Western countries and legally recommended by law in Belgium since 2006. Living with both parents after divorce is assumed to increase children's well-being, through a better parent-child relationship, but may also be stressful, as children live in 2 different family settings. In this study, we investigate whether the association between the residential arrangement of adolescents and 3 measures of subjective well-being (depressive feelings, life satisfaction, and self-esteem) is moderated by the Big Five personality factors. The sample is selected from the national representative Divorce in Flanders study and contains information about 506 children from divorced parents between 14- and 21-years-old. Our findings indicated a consistent pattern of interactions between conscientiousness and joint physical custody for 2 of the 3 subjective well-being indicators. The specific demands of this residential arrangement (making frequent transitions, living at 2 places, adjustment to 2 different lifestyles, etc.) may interfere with the nature of conscientious adolescents: being organized, ordered, and planful. Our results showed support for a Person × Environment interaction, and demonstrate the need for considering the individual characteristics of the child when settling postdivorce residential arrangements.",

Namun saat ini standar moral tampak semakin menurun setiap harinya. Hal ini mungkin terjadi mengingat lebih banyak ‘model’ yang buruk bagi anak melalui media massa seperti televisi, internet, majalah, dan video games. Selain itu merosotnya nilai-nilai moral merupakan kegagalan orang tua dalam melakukan pendidikan karakter dan moral responsibility pada anak.\r\nMoral responsibility adalah tanggung jawab yang berhubungan dengan tindakan-tindakan dan konsekuensi-konsekuensinya di dalam hubungan sosial. Secara umum, moral responsibility berhubungan dengan dampak negatif yang menimpa perorangan, kelompok, atau seluruh masyarakat akibat tindakan yang dilakukan ataupun tidak dilakukan oleh individu lain, kelompok atau seluruh masyarakat. Perilaku yang seringkali menimbulkan efek negatif pada individu, kelompok atau masyarakat lain adalah perilaku yang menimbulkan krisis lingkungan seperti pencemaran lingkungan dengan membuang sampah sembarangan, ataupun eksploitasi sumber daya alam, melalui pengurangan lahan hijau, penggunaan air bersih dan energi secara tidak bijak.\r\nGenerasi saat ini mengemban komitmen moral terhadap kesejahteraan generasi berikutnya. Kegagalan orang tua menjadi model moral bagi anak dapat ditutupi melalui pendidikan karakter di sekolah. Sekolah adalah institusi sosial yang dapat memberikan efek yang signifikan terhadap performansi akademik dan perilaku yang baik. Oleh karena itu sekolah dapat menolong anak mengembangkan moral responsibility melalui berbagai program pendidikan seperti character building, personality development, self responsibility, dsb. Dalam rangka merespon krisis lingkungan, enviromental education di sekolah melalui pengembangan moral responsibility menunjukkan usaha untuk mengajak generasi muda berbagi tanggung jawab moral bagi kesejahteraan generasi yang akan datang.",

The ‘rearing’ of non-natal children was so ubiquitous in Roman Hieradoumia that fosterage appears to have been a standard familial strategy for circulating children temporarily or permanently between households, rather than necessarily a response to orphanhood or extreme familial dysfunction. Foster-children could be of either higher or lower social status than their foster-parents; in a few cases, there is reason to think that children were reared by close relatives (particularly the natal parents’ siblings). It is argued that one of the social functions of fosterage was to cement ties or alliances between family groups; the word synteknos may be a technical term for the relationship between natal parent and foster-parent. Sentimental relations between foster-kin were often very close, and we often find foster-kin assimilated to natal kin.",

Home-based care can put family life under considerable strain, as parents care for their child’s complex, often unpredictable, continuing care needs. Rainbow Trust Children’s Charity aims to bridge gaps in services for children with life-threatening or terminal conditions by providing family support workers (FSWs). The study used a range of methods (surveys, interviews and ethnographic observation) approach to explore key aspects of the work of the FSWs. The target population for the surveys was families with a child having complex, life-threatening or terminal conditions receiving care from FSWs. The participants included 55 families (12 bereaved) and 39 children aged 2–18 years. Thematic analysis revealed how the FSWs became a presence in families’ lives in three main ways: (1) encompassing and embracing families through supporting needs and promoting resilience; (2) befriending and bonding through developing knowledge, trusting relationships and a sense of closeness; and (3) accompanying and enduring by ‘being with’ families in different settings, situations and crises and by enduring alongside the families. The study demonstrated the fundamental importance of workers who are able to provide aspects of support that is usually not provided by other services.",

      "abstract": "All developmental stages pose unique challenges for families. The transition from childhood to adolescence is often difficult for families to understand and deal with effectively. Parents of adolescents must find ways to let go of some of the control while still remaining close to their child. This is difficult when adolescents are prone to rebellion, defiance of convention, and separation from family. Health care providers who work with adolescents with diabetes have reported that adolescent patients are often the most difficult patients. It may be, however, that adolescents are not so difficult. Rather, it may be that the developmental transition to adolescence requires different strategies for relating to adolescents versus younger children. A useful way to understand this developmental transition is to compare and contrast how one may interact with a dog versus a cat.1\n\nDogs are much like children in that they are dependent on others, enjoy being around a variety of people, tend to respond to discipline, and are usually up for just about anything. Cats, on the other hand, are more like adolescents. Cats are independent, enjoy their solitude, need a great deal of cajoling to do things, and are difficult to discipline. Both dogs and cats enjoy affection from their caregivers. Dogs typically are open to any type of affection: belly rubs, ear scratches, rough-and-tumble play, and so forth. Cats, however, require affection on their own terms. One has to think like a cat to know how to approach the cat to give it affection. Otherwise, the caregiver risks rejection from the cat. There are many striking parallels between dogs and cats on the one hand and children and adolescents on the other.\n\nDespite the differences between cats and dogs (or children and adolescents), they both need affection, involvement, and limit setting.

En plus de considerer le statut d'activite comme une variable a part entiere, les transformations de l'inactivite feminine, notamment le passage par l'emploi qui la caracterise desormais, sont prises en compte pour repondre a cette question. Le statut d'activite a des effets sur les pratiques culturelles des meres de famille, qui demeurent, par ailleurs, fortement hierarchisees par le niveau de diplome et le milieu social. Les loisirs des inactives sont largement centres sur l'univers domestique et sur le foyer, qu'elles soient ou non passees par le marche du travail anterieurement, alors que celles des actives s'orientent davantage vers les sorties culturelles. Si les effets du statut d'activite sont relativement limites sur la nature des loisirs des enfants, qui portent la marque de l'origine sociale, ils sont plus marques sur le role tenu par la mere. Les inactives anciennes actives se distinguent en etant les plus impliquees dans les loisirs de leurs enfants. Elles utilisent notamment les livres pour enfants comme des supports pedagogiques et non pour transmettre le gout pour la lecture comme le font les plus diplomees. Elles tentent ainsi de renforcer les activites educatives, au detriment des activites domestiques, dans le modele de la femme au foyer.

Son, por tanto, familias potencialmente funcionales, en las que las pautas transaccionales que regulan la conducta familiar pueden volverse rigidas hasta tal punto que se produzca una detencion del desarrollo e inadaptacion social del hijo afectado y graves alteraciones en la maduracion sistemica de la familia. En este trabajo se pretende ofrecer las directrices de un modelo ecosistemico de analisis e interpretacion de estos fenomenos, con el objetivo ultimo de establecer criterios de evaluacion e intervencion familiar especificos para estos tipos de familia. Abstract The birth of a child affected by a serious mental disability brings about a traumatic experience which marks the family out from the rest of all families, but does not define necessarily the well being of that family. They are, therefore, families which are potentially functional in which the transactional patterns which regulate the family behaviour may become strict to such a extent as to provoke a halt in the mental development of the affected child making in become a social inadapted. The same too strict patterns may cause serious alterations in the systemic growth of the family. In this work we want to offer the guidelines of an ecosystemic model of analysis and interpretation of these phenomena with the final goal of setting up evaluation criteria and specific family intervention for these types of families.",

Several \"stressors\" have been identified: separation from the family environment, patient-status, worries about their own health and about the outcome of their pregnancy, living conditions in hospital. The women's adaptation to hospitalization may interfere with their pregnancy adaptation. Defense mechanisms may be disturbed. Several factors can modulate the psychological effect of hospitalization in a positive or negative way: traumatic events during previous pregnancies, relation established during childhood with their own parents, support from social networks, staff attitude towards the pregnant women's demands of information, participation in decision making, verbalization of anxiety, etc. Hospitalization or pregnancy complications may induce a decrease of pregnancy acception, and the self-esteem of pregnant women but it has not been shown that under these situations mother-fetus attachment is diminished.",

      "title": "Transitions in Young Adulthood in Great Britain",
      "abstract": "The passage from adolescence to adulthood is a multi-faceted and complex process often extending over a period of years from the mid-teens to the mid to late twenties. No one single event marks the attainment of adult status, but it usually involves changes from economic dependence upon parents to economic independence and from participation in the family of origin to establishment of one's own family. Becoming an adult usually involves a number of key transitions: finishing full-time education; entry into the labour market; leaving home; establishment of an independent household; and entry into marriage and parenthood. Not everyone experiences all these transitions nor by any means follows such a sequence. Some transitions may be by-passed altogether and others may coincide. British studies that give joint consideration to the economic and familial transitions are rare (American examples are Modell, 1989 and Hogan, 1981). Specialists tend to concentrate on the transition from school to work or the transition to marriage and having children whilst the inter-relations and interdependence between them have received scant attention. As yet there is a lack of coherent data for studying sets of transitions in young adulthood. Cross-sectional current status data on the activity patterns and living arrangements of young adults, such as the Labour Force Survey used here, are the most commonly available and more up-to-date source, but they can only provide clues as to the timing of transitions. More direct estimates of the timing, prevalence and sequencing of transitions require life-history data. Such data are rare. However, for one British cohort born in 1958, it is possible to examine the dynamics of transitions in young adulthood over the age range 16 to 23 years by making use of data from the National Child Development Study (Shepherd, 1985). To set the scene, we consider how the size of the young adult population has changed in the recent past and will change in the near future.",

      "abstract": "Normally expected transitions connect the various periods of life. Often these transitions are prompted by life events that require adaptation to a changed circumstance and may challenge both individual and family quality of life. Such transitions may be planful (proactive) or demand (reactive). Little, however, has been written about the nature of such transitions and how they specifically affect older-aged families of adults with Down syndrome. Such families are often predominate lifelong carers of adults with Down syndrome. Drawing on research and experience, the authors examined three transition points from a family perspective. Each of these points of change requires that people adapt and may lead to various outcomes, including at times outcomes that are unexpected, stressful, and challenging. The three points of transition examined include moving away from the parental home, changes occurring within a residential service (e.g., staff changes, relocations), and the reactions to the onset and course of dementia. Vignettes and quotes illustrate the complexities of these transitions and show that, even with planful management, often such transitions can go awry and produce unpredictable outcomes.",

      "abstract": "In this paper ambivalent commitments to parenting and family life by the New Labour government are explored by reference to the example of adoption support. Developments in adoption illuminate contrasting expectations in family policy and children's services more generally. Traditional normative concerns to support family status and parental autonomy are unsettled by contemporary anxieties about child outcomes and social mobility. Impatience with the attitudes and behaviour of parents has led to a ‘progressive universalism’ in which enhanced parenting services and expectations for all are combined with increasingly insistent and targeted interventions for the particularly needy, reluctant or recalcitrant few. At the same time demands for greater service modernization and professional effectiveness have led government to position parents as (potential) consumers too. The paper discusses these policy and practice tensions and concludes that new spaces are being opened up for the negotiation between parents and professionals about rights and responsibilities in family life and its support.",

      "title": "Companion Animals: Associations With Social Isolation, Loneliness, and Satisfaction With Life in Portuguese Community-Dwelling Older Adults",
      "abstract": "Companion animals play an increasingly important role in people's lives. However, research on how they affect community-dwelling older adults remains scarce and there are inconsistent results. This study examined the impact of companion animals on loneliness, social isolation, depressive symptomatology, satisfaction with life, and satisfaction with social support in Portuguese community-dwelling older adults. This cross-sectional descriptive and correlational questionnaire study involved 250 participants (≥ 65 years old). The questionnaire comprised sociodemographic questions; questions about companion animals; self-perception of loneliness; the Social Isolation Scale; Lubben's Brief Social Network Scale; the Satisfaction with Life Scale; the Satisfaction with Social Support Scale; and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Descriptive, inferential, and correlational analyses and logistic regression were conducted. Caregivers of companion animals, compared with non-caregivers, tended to live in rural areas (OR = 1), in houses (OR = 2.465), and with extended families (OR = 4.540). No significant differences between caregivers and non-caregivers were found for social isolation, loneliness, satisfaction with social support, and satisfaction with life. However, people with depressive symptoms were 1.7 times more likely to have companion animals than those with no depressive symptoms (p = 0.032). Companion animals, which included some farm animals, provided a high degree of companionship (8.39 ± 1.94, on a scale of 0–10), and this differed significantly between the groups having \"only dogs,\" \"only cats,\" \"dogs and cats,\" and \"neither dogs nor cats\" (H = 13.279, p = 0.004). Having \"only dogs\" (8.81) and \"both dogs and cats\" (9.22) provided the highest degree of companionship when compared with \"only cats\" (7.86) and \"neither dogs nor cats\" (7.67). Companion animals did not seem to be instrumental in terms of social interaction and satisfaction with life. Therefore, companion animals are important in providing companionship for older people. Future research should look more closely at the bond between older caregivers and companion animals.",

      "abstract": "In middle childhood, peers become important as children spend more time away from home. Major improvements occur in children's ability to understand the perspective of others and in their inferences about the psychological attributes of others, as well as of themselves. Social development continues to result from a complex interaction between genes and the environment in which children find themselves, and behavior geneticists have begun to identify the role of genetic mediation in social development, as well as specific genes that are involved in various social behaviors. Different children respond to the same socialization intervention in different ways, depending on a host of factors including variables such as age, sex, temperament, and the cultural context in which the intervention takes place. As a result, effective socialization is a function of the way children perceive and respond to a given intervention, rather than a function of a specific action on the part of the socializing agent. Socialization goes on in a variety of domains, with each domain characterized by a different kind of relationship between agent of socialization and child, and the actions of the latter need to be appropriate to the relationship or domain that is currently activated. Although parents, peers, and siblings differ considerably in their characteristics relative to the child being socialized, they all, nevertheless, operate in the same set of domains or relationships.",

      "abstract": "Primates are highly social beings. They begin their lives clinging to their mother and nursing, and they spend their next few months, or even years, still in proximity to her. Adult primates live in close-knit social groups, for the most part, in which members individually recognize one another and form various types of long-term social relationships (Tomasello & Call, 1994, 1997). As primates, human beings follow this same pattern, of course, but they also have unique forms of sociality that may be characterized as \"ultrasocial\" or, in more common parlance, \"cultural\" (Tomasello, Krüger, & Ratner, 1993). The forms of sociality that are mostly clearly unique to human beings emerge in their ontogeny at approximately 9 months of age – what I have called the 9-month social-cognitive revolution (Tomasello, 1995). This is the age at which infants typically begin to engage in the kinds of joint-attentional interactions in which they master the use of cultural artifacts, including tools and language, and become fully active participants in all types of cultural rituals, scripts, and games. In this chapter, my goals are to (1) characterize the primate and human forms of sociality and cultural transmission, and (2) characterize in more detail the ontogeny of human cultural propensities.",

      "abstract": "While in many cases the decision to have a child approaches parents, in some cases it changes (at least temporarily) the relationship in harm. A couple turns into a relationship between three people and the jealousy, the changes in the sexual relationship and the stress resulting from the three factors above play a role in reducing the closeness between the couples members. Couples differ a lot in the successful negotiation of the transition to parenthood. Many factors are involved in the production of these differences: the age and maturity of parents, their relationship with their own parents, the social support available to them, the level of marital satisfaction existing before the child appears, and any form of postnatal depression that he / a mother. Another influence that needs to be taken into consideration when adapting parents is the child himself. It is shown that when a new-born is \"difficult\"(either because of innate temperamental qualities, or because of prematurity, illness, or disability), parents will not only live the transition as stressful but, in the case of vulnerable relationships, they may even break apart. At the same time, parents have to evolve in their teachings that they do not have complete control over the lives of their children and that the decisions taken by their son / daughter can be very different from what they think fit.",

Encounters were coded into different domains (moral, social-conventional, prudential, etc.), and children's reactions compared across domains within each pair of encounters. Instead of the standard \"right\"/\"wrong\" question, the children were asked why they would/wouldn't commit the transgression again. All children said that they wouldn't do it again, but their reasons were more often congruent or consistent with the nature of prudential than of other kinds of transgressions, especially than moral transgressions. This suggests that while children may know \"right from wrong,\" they do not see it as relevant to their moral behavior.",

      "abstract": "Parental death can have a negative impact on children’s lives with changes in economic resources, and lead to change in residence, loss of contact with friends and neighbors, change in caretakers, and loss of time with the surviving parent. Research on the effects of a grandparent’s death on children is limited. Death of a sibling signifies the loss of a role model, friend, confidante, and playmate. The purpose of this correlational study was to identify: 1) differences in the spiritual coping strategies used by children across age groups, gender, race/ethnicity, participation in religious rituals and practices, and the relationship of the deceased to the child (parent, grandparent or sibling), and 2) the relationship between children’s use of spiritual coping strategies and grief, personal growth, anxiety, and depression after the death, with and without controls for child’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, participation in religious rituals and practices, and relationship of the deceased to the child. A sample of 97 children, 8 to 18 years old and 64% Hispanic completed the Spiritual Coping Strategies Scale, Hogan Inventory of Bereavement, Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale, and Child Depression Inventory, and their parents completed a demographic form. Children who participated in religious rituals after the death used less religious coping strategies than children who did not participate. When child’s age, gender, race/ethnicity, participation in religious rituals and practices, and relationship of the deceased were controlled, greater use of spiritual coping, but not religious coping, and greater grief were significantly related to greater personal growth and greater anxiety. Younger children and Black children had significantly greater anxiety. Only grief was significantly related to depression. Children who experienced the death of a parent, grandparent, or sibling had similar outcomes. The results of this pioneer study will add knowledge to the state of the science regarding the effects of children’s spiritual coping after parent, grandparent, or sibling death on their grief, personal growth, and mental health which is a subject area were very little is known.",

      "title": "Exclusion from Social Relations Among Older People in Rural Britain and Belgium: A Cross-National Exploration Taking a Life-Course and Multilevel Perspective",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reports on a cross-national exploration on manifestations and drivers of exclusion from social relations, in rural Britain and Belgium. Each study was composed of a quantitative and qualitative phase. The quantitative phases operationalised exclusion from social relations using existing datasets within each country while both qualitative phases comprised life history interviews with older people. The results demonstrate that although social relations are vital for several reasons ( e.g. health and care, practical support in times of poverty, safety), older participants in both countries regularly face exclusion from social relations ( e.g. feelings of loneliness, isolation, “bad” social relations). The results show a strong interrelationship between exclusion from social relations and other domains of exclusion ( e.g. economic and material exclusion). In terms of drivers of exclusion from social relations, the life stories revealed micro risk factors ( e.g. marital status and gender), exo ( e.g. being remote and rural living) and macro drivers of exclusion from social relations ( e.g. inadequate social security and population change). The conclusion discusses the main limitations of this cross-national exploration and offers some tangible policy and further research recommendations.",

      "title": "The Social Ecology of Resolving Family Conflict Among West African Immigrants in New York: A Grounded Theory Approach",
      "abstract": "Abstract The current study employs a grounded theory approach to examine West African immigrants’ resolution of parent–child conflict and intimate partner conflict. Data from 59 participants present an interactive social ecological framework, where a lack of resolution at one level results in attempts to resolve problems at higher levels. Four levels are identified within West African immigrants’ problem solving ecology, each with specific actors in positions of authority: individual/dyadic (parents and spouses), extended family (which includes distant relatives and relatives living in home countries), community leadership (non‐family elders and religious leaders), and state authorities. From participants’ descriptions of family challenges emerged a picture of a social ecology in flux, with traditional, socially conservative modes of resolving family conflict transposed across migration into the more liberal and state‐oriented familial context of the United States. This transposition results in a loss spiral for the traditional social ecology, differentially affecting individual actors within families. Implications for helping professionals working with new immigrant communities include identifying variability in openness to adapting structures that are not working well (e.g., patriarchal protection of abusive husbands) and supporting structures known to be associated with well being (e.g., collective monitoring of youth).",

      "abstract": "The salutary effects of being raised by two married, biological parents depend on the quality of care parents can provide. Using data from an epidemiological sample of 1,116 5–year–old twin pairs and their parents, this study found that the less time fathers lived with their children, the more conduct problems their children had, but only if the fathers engaged in low levels of antisocial behavior. In contrast, when fathers engaged in high levels of antisocial behavior, the more time they lived with their children, the more conduct problems their children had. Behavioral genetic analyses showed that children who resided with antisocial fathers received a “double whammy” of genetic and environmental risk for conduct problems. Marriage may not be the answer to the problems faced by some children living in single–parent families unless their fathers can become reliable sources of emotional and economic support.",

      "abstract": "Key points * Mixed-parent couples in Britain were often in sustained relationships, and a high proportion were middle class. * The couples interviewed used three typical approaches to instil a sense of belonging in their children; particular approaches were not associated with particular racial or faith combinations: o Individual: children's sense of belonging was not seen as rooted in their mixed background. o Mix: children's mixed background was understood as a factual part of their identity; all aspects were emphasised. o Single: one aspect of children's mixed background was stressed. * Couples whose approach differed in giving their children a sense of belonging were not necessarily in conflict. For some, divergent approaches were complementary. Others saw difficulties between them as humanistic, political or personality choices. * Parents identified supportive or constraining resources and relationships in creating a sense of belonging, including neighbourhoods, schools, travel, languages, grandparents and children themselves. What some regarded as supportive, others saw as drawbacks. * Mixed-parent couples can be more concerned with other issues, such as children's safety and health, unity over discipline and financial security. * The researchers conclude that it is important that family support, health, education and social services do not make assumptions about mixed families. Families who seem to share a form of mixing can differ from each other. 'Mixedness' may be insignificant for some, compared to other issues. Mixed families would benefit from policies and practice that further tackle prejudice based on race and faith.",

Weak ties differ from intimate ties in emotional quality, stability, density (i.e., who knows whom), and status hierarchies. Undoubtedly, close ties are essential for human survival. Yet peripheral ties may enhance life quality and allow people to flourish. Weak ties may serve (a) distinct functions from intimate ties (e.g., information, resources, novel behaviors, and diversion), (b) parallel functions to intimate ties (e.g., defining identity and positions within social hierarchies, helping when a family member is ill, providing a sense of familiarity), and (c) reciprocal influences between peripheral partners and family members (e.g., bioecological theory).

In exploring the origins of jealousy, suggested that jealousy may have originally evolved outside the mating context as sibling rivalry in response to differential access to parental attention and resources. She suggested that the emotion may have later generalized to the attention and resources provided by friends and mates. Research with children has found that older siblings often display jealousy toward a new arrival in the family that can be observed as early as infancy. Infants as young as six months show distress when parents direct their attention away from the child toward a lifelike baby doll but not when attention is directed toward non‐social toys. Also, eight‐month‐old children attempt to distract their mother when she stops interacting with them and interacts with another child.",

      "title": "Adult Children Taking Parents into Their Homes: Effects of Childhood Living Arrangements",
      "abstract": "This article explores whether childhood living arrangements (living with single or remarried parents, exposure to extended households) impact attitudes toward and implementation of parental coresidence. The results indicate that positive attitudes toward parental coresidence are less common among those raised by single fathers and more common among women exposed to traditional extended households. Parental coresidence is more prevalent among men and women raised by single or remarried mothers, as well as men living with single fathers, and less common among individuals living with remarried fathers. Key Words: childhood living arrangements, coresidence, extended family, grandparents, intergenerational solidarity. Little is known about whether and how early childhood living arrangements affect adult children's propensity to take aging parents into their homes. Past research on caregiving has focused on the characteristics of current family structure such as sibling composition, the marital status of parent or child, or competing roles (Coward & Dwyer, 1990; Matthews, 1987; Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990; Stoller & Pugliesi, 1989). Studies devoted to parent-adult child coresidence often do not differentiate between arrangements where adult children coreside with parents and arangements where the parent or parents coreside with the adult child. Consequently, they confound factors related to adult children's dependency on their parents with variables associated with children's willingness to care for their parents. Most of these investigations also fail to include detailed indicators of childhood living arrangements as predictors of coresidence (Aquilino, 1990; Brody, Litvin, Hoffman, & Kleban, 1995; Crimmins & Ingegneri, 1990; Ward & Spitze, 1994; Ward, Logan, & Spitze, 1992). In contrast, research dealing with the effects of childhood living arrangements has focused on outcomes such as personal adjustment, socioeconomic attainment, and interactions and supports between the parent and the adult child (Amato, 1991; Amato & Keith, 1991; Aquilino, 1994a, 1994b; Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Whitbeck, Hoyt, & Huck, 1994; Whitbeck, Simons, & Conger, 1991). These latter studies provide considerable evidence of the long-range effects of childhood living arrangements on later kin relationships, but they do not address how such living arrangements may influence children's propensity to take older parents into their homes. This study expands earlier research on parentadult child coresidence by exploring whether childhood living arrangements influence adult children's attitudes toward taking a parent into their home and whether adult children ever did have a parent live with them. MODELS OF INTERGENERATIONAL SOLIDARITY Taking parents into one's home and attitudes about parental coresidence constitute dimensions of intergenerational solidarity (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991). Parental coresidence is a special case of functional solidarity (exchange of supports or resources), and attitudes about parental coresidence represent an example of normative solidarity (strength of commitment to performance of family roles and to meeting familial obligations, Bengtson & Roberts, 1991, p. 857). Several authors have proposed theoretical models of intergenerational solidarity. Bengtson and his colleagues (Bengtson & Roberts, 1991; Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson, 1995) view functional solidarity foremost as an outcome of normative and affectional solidarity (positive sentiments about family members; Bengtson & Roberts, 1991, p. 857) and of opportunity structures. Relying on exchange theory as well as Tonnies' concept of Gemeinschaft, these authors argue that exchanges of supports between generations reflect, on the one hand, feelings of obligation about the provision of specific supports and, on the other hand, affection between parents and (adult) children. …",

Qualitative interviews with adult children of alcoholic parents were conducted. Some informants in this study grew up with one alcohol abusing parent, while some grew up with two alcohol abusing parents. The results shows that the extent of addiction was different among parents, but common were that relationships and interactions in families were negatively infected by the substance abusing behaviour. Family life was characterized by chaos and unpredictability by many informants. A high level of conflicts was also common in the families. As children most of the informants took a lot of responsibility, especially for the care of younger siblings. The parental alcohol abuse was hidden from the community, and was almost never talked about, neither inside or outside of the family.All the informants expressed an absence of social support and help, from their networks as well as from society. Some of the families had contact with the social services, but none of the informants felt like they got enough help. Some of the informants got help from a support group for children with substance abusing parents, while others did not get any help at all. All informants felt loyalty to their family and parents and therefore avoided to reveal their parents alcohol abuse, which made it even more difficult for the community to help. The informants expressed that children growing up today with substance abusing parents need a lot more help from society. One way to reach out to these children is to educate teachers and other professionals in school in how to pay better attention to children of alcoholic parents.",

Three primary categories emerged: estrangement resulted from intrafamily, interfamily, or intrapersonal issues. Within each category, the frequency of parents' and children's reasons for estrangement differed significantly from each other. Parents reported that their primary reason for becoming estranged stemmed from their children's objectionable relationships or sense of entitlement, whereas adult children most frequently attributed their estrangement to their parents' toxic behavior or feeling unsupported and unaccepted. Parents also reported that they were unsure of the reason for their estrangement significantly more often than did children. Examining estrangement from the perspective of both parents and adult children offers potential avenues for family reconciliation and future communication research.",

      "title": "The role of dogs is associated with owner management practices and characteristics, but not with perceived canine behaviour problems",
      "abstract": "Abstract Owned dogs are often regarded as family members, best friends, or even as substitutes for children. These new roles and their effects on human well-being have received scientific attention, but little is known about how attributing such social functions to dogs might influence the caring behaviour of the owner, which in turn can impact canine welfare. Our online survey of Hungarian dog owners (N = 790) aimed to describe what owners appreciate the most and the least in their dogs and to investigate the relationship between the social and non-social functions of the dog, the characteristics of the owner and the dog, the management practices of the owner, as well as the dog’s behaviour, including behaviour problems. We found that most owners appreciated petting and physical contact with their dog (97.6%), followed by ‘unconditional love’ (93.7%), the dog’s beauty (88.4%), and walking with the dog (86.5%). The most frequently mentioned problems were socialisation issues (20.4%) and lack of time (15.9%). Regarding canine behaviour, jumping up (33.2%), chasing animals (28.5%), territoriality (26.7%), and overexcitement (20.9%) were common problems. Almost a quarter of owners rated their dogs as totally obedient and 30.6% as totally safe off-leash. We identified three profiles of dog owners based on the roles they attribute to their dogs. Dogs with both companionship and practical functions (31.1%) were perceived as more obedient and provided higher safety benefits to their owners than others. Dogs regarded as ‘companion animals’ (19.4%) spent less time with their owners and had older owners than others. Lastly, owners labelled as ‘dog parents’ (49.5%) were more likely to keep their dog indoors only than others. Importantly, the roles attributed to dogs were not associated with owner-reported canine behaviour problems. We concluded that while the functions humans attribute to dogs are multiple and appear to have direct implications for the dogs’ daily lives, these variations in management practices do not necessarily seem to compromise their welfare.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric healthcare providers understand that the early years of children's lives are critical to their health and learning. Babies are born wired for social interaction and through parental nurturing and responsive caregiving, secure attachment is established.1 Through this attachment, parents’ problem-solving skills and parenting styles, infants and young children can learn to regulate their emotions and enable the development of meaningful relationships.1 Indeed, emotional regulation through attachment is considered to be the cornerstone for ongoing positive mental health.2 For families, parenting can bring a range of physical, emotional and social changes where mothers often need considerable support, especially from people they are close to.3 How parents and families manage depends on a range of factors. Some parents acquire knowledge and skills that support health behaviors through education, a supportive workplace or prior exposure to caring for young children.4 Some families are well supported by extended family and a network of friends and neighbors, which encourages community connection and engagement in early learning and developmental activities.4 However, other parents are not well supported, feel physically or culturally isolated and have limited access to health services or community resources.5 A child's needs may be compromised if a mother's responsiveness is affected by anxiety or depression.6 Further, the stress, anxiety and fatigue experienced by parents can impact their caregiving and undermine their parenting confidence, potentially influencing their child's emotional, attentional and cognitive regulation.2 In addition, such experiences of stress may result in maladaptive responses between parents, such as taking out their frustrations on each other, further impacting the psychosocial environment.7 A need for improved approaches in health care to support family functioning has been identified,8 especially for families managing their child's major health problem7 and for those living with socio-economic disadvantage.2 Such evidence highlights the need to support the psychosocial environments of young children and families to enable them to build confidence, connect with others and engage with appropriate community resources.4 In practice, talking about psychological and social issues with families can be challenging for healthcare providers, especially when children are ill.9 Parents attending a healthcare facility with their child will put their child's needs first and feel that talking about their worries may detract from the care required for their child.10 Some parents have reported feeling judged about being unable to cope or believing they are inadequate as parents, which can reduce their likelihood of engaging in conversations with healthcare providers.9 For healthcare providers, there is reluctance about discussing family issues with parents for fear of opening up a “can of worms” that leads to the potential unfolding of a range of complex problems.11 However, talking with families is integral to healthcare providers, especially pediatric nurses who provide care for the child in the context of the family.12 Once psychosocial issues are identified, interventions that promote engagement and community participation include complex social processes.4 Linking with others and engaging in community activities results in reported benefits to parents’ psychological health and confidence-building,3 improved family access to local services,4 and enhanced effectiveness of interventions that are based on partnership-building.13 Whether family-centered or community-centered, each intervention depends on building a partnership that is based on mutual respect and collegiality, and guided by genuine enquiry and reflective listening.14 This research evidence illustrates a need to implement interventions based on partnership-building and communication about psychosocial issues with young children and families. By focusing research on the issues that matter most to families and ensuring that parents are engaged as equal partners in their children's health, interventions are more likely to be feasible and sustainable. More importantly, such focused enquiry acknowledges family functioning and the caregiving environment as key determinants for the long-term health and developmental outcomes of young children and their families. In this issue of the JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports, enquiry focuses on the health of children and the influence of family. In all cases, a psychosocial assessment can enhance parental engagement and present healthcare providers with information that enables them to offer the most appropriate support to parents, leading to the best health outcomes for children.

      "abstract": "상당수 노인범죄자들은 한 번의 범죄가 원인이 되어 범죄의 고리에서 벗어나지 못하고 있다. 이러한 악순환은 범죄인에 대한 시설 내 처우인 교정과 교화에서 효과를 거두지 못함은 물론 사회적으로 출소자 보호 관리체계의 미진함을 드러내고 있다. 따라서 노인범죄자의 재범방지를 실현하기 위해서는 기존의 시설 내 구금에서 사회 내 처우로 방향을 대전환하여 노인범죄자들에 대한 사회 내 처우로의 전환과 동시 기구조직과 인력, 재정적 지원이 따라야 되겠다. 예컨대 미국은 과거 30년간 수용자의 재사회화 및 출소자 사회복귀 프로그램에 정책적인 투자를 하지 않았고, 그 결과 재범을 비롯한 크나큰 사회적 병폐를 낳았다. 범죄, 수사, 재판, 교정, 갱생보호로 이어지는 일련의 범죄인의 처우과정에서 어느 한 단계마다 중요하지 않은 단계가 없지만은 재범방지를 위한 마지막 단계인 갱생보호단계 즉, 사회적 처우 단계가 실패하면 그 이전의 모든 단계가 성공적이었다 하더라도 결국 재범의 길로 접어 들 수밖에 없을 것이고 모든 단계의 노력은 수포로 돌아 갈 것이다. 하지만 이전의 전 과정에서 비록 재범예방을 위한 처우가 조금 부족했다 하더라도 최종단계인 갱생보호단계인 사회적 처우과정에서 실질적이고 체계적인 방향으로 나아간다면 재범방지의 효과는 나타날 것이다. 노인범죄자에 대한 효과적인 범죄예방과 실질적인 처우를 가능하게 하고 이들의 재범방지를 위한 사법 복지적 처우방안을 마련하는데 있다. 따라서 사법복지는 범죄문제에 대하여 형사사법기관과 사회복지기관 그리고 개인 상호협력‧공조체계를 유지해 가면서 범죄문제에 효과적으로 대처해 나아가야겠다.",

      "abstract": "Changing ecological and social factors should result in different degrees of acculturation of family values associated with the traditional hierarchical collectivist family system, between parents and their sons and daughters within rural and urban contexts. A family values questionnaire was given to 226 three-person families (mother, father, 18-year-old son or daughter; 110 from Athens and 116 from small communities). The results indicate that (a) values associated with hierarchical father-mother roles were rejected by young people from both Athens and small communities, (b) Athenian parents were in a middle position, and (c) parents from small communities still agreed with these values. Gender was an important variable in that daughters were more rejecting than were sons of the traditional family hierarchical collectivistic structure and fathers of daughters were more traditional than were fathers of sons, whereas no such relationships were found with mothers. Also there appeared to be two stages in the acculturation of the collectivist family values, the first being rejection of the authority of the father and the second being the active disobedience of paternal authority.",

A continuación, un análisis más fino permite hacer una distinción entre una sociabilidad « interna » y una sociabilidad « externa » ya que ambas modalidades evolucionan en conformidad con los ciclos de la vida : al envejecer, se va dejando a un lado la sociabilidad externa para la sociabilidad interna y las actividades de sociabilidad van menguando. Mas la categoría social influye en este fenómeno : un etevado estatuto social aminora el decrecimiento de la sociabilidad a raiz del envejecimiento.",

      "abstract": "This study classified the child abuse in family focusing on heterosexual family composition and relationship of caregivers, and explored the characteristics of victims according to each type. Cluster analysis revealed five types: “family restructuring” (27.1%), occurring in newly formed relationships such as remarriage or cohabitation of caregivers; “distorted discipline” (23.5%), involving prolonged family structure with distorted discipline as the main motive; “aggressive” (18.1%), where one of the biological parents expressed anger and desires in the presence of both parents; “intimate partner violence” (15.6%), occurred with child abuse; and “care burden” (15.7%), where abuse occurred while providing care alone or without support after giving birth. The “aggressive” and “family restructuring” types had a higher occurrence of sexual abuse, and the “care burden” type had a higher occurrence among children under the age of one. The “distorted discipline” and “aggressive” types showed significant harm to older children. The “intimate partner violence” type had male perpetrators predominantly, while the “care burden” type had female perpetrators in the majority. These results highlight the need for proactive intervention against wife abuse, ensuring women's reproductive rights, and prevention policies that consider vulnerabilities based on child age and caregiver relationships.",

      "abstract": "Las normas son criterios que indican a una persona que, como y cuando realizar una accion o tarea, por tanto, son una sugerencia de cambio de comportamiento que implica unas consecuencias positivas en caso de cumplimiento, y unas consecuencias negativas en caso de su incumplimiento. A medida que los hijos van creciendo se debe tratar de llegar a un acuerdo sobre las normas, que satisfaga tanto a padres como a hijos, pero en el caso de que no sea posible alcanzar un acuerdo, es fundamental senalar que siempre prevalecera el criterio adoptado por los padres. La familia y la diversidad de relaciones que derivan de ella son temas de suma importancia en el quehacer de la disciplina psicologica. El establecimiento de normas y limites en el contexto familiar supone uno de los factores de proteccion mas significativos para reducir la probabilidad de aparicion de conductas de riesgo, tanto en la infancia como en la adolescencia. Mediante la familia se logra un proceso de integracion y regulacion social de los individuos que la conforman; este proceso de interaccion del individuo favorece varios aspectos: aprendizaje de reglas, asimilacion de patrones de conducta, adquisicion del lenguaje, las costumbres y la cultura, ademas de cubrir necesidades fisicas primordiales, crear vinculos afectivos y estilos de relacion. Por ello, las interacciones familiares y los estilos paternos de crianza afectan de manera importante el desarrollo psicologico durante la infancia y la adolescencia y determinan en gran medida las caracteristicas que definen el comportamiento social del individuo, incluso su nivel de competencia academica (Jimenez, 2009; Jimenez y Guevara, 2008).",

      "abstract": "Primates are long-lived, highly social mammals who maintain long-term social bonds and cohesive social groups through many affiliative mechanisms, foremost among them social touch. From birth through adulthood, social touch – primarily mutual grooming – creates and maintains relationships of trust and reliance, which are the basis for individual physical and emotional well-being and reproductive success. Because social touch helps to establish, maintain, and repair social alliances in primates, it contributes to the emotional stability of individuals and the cohesion of social groups. In these fundamental ways, thus, social touch supports the slow life histories of primates. The reinforcing neurochemistry of social touch insures that it is a pleasurable activity and this, in turn, makes it a behavioral commodity that can be traded between primates for desirable rewards such as protection against future aggression or opportunities to handle infants. Social touch is essential to normal primate development, and individuals deprived of social touch exhibit high levels of anxiety and lower fertility compared to those receiving regular social touch. Understanding the centrality of social touch to primate health and well-being throughout the lifespan provides the foundation for appreciating the importance of social touch in human life.",

      "title": "Construction of knowledge among young children before their entry to school",
      "abstract": "Even after a long tradition of scientific study of children and their development, not much is known about the private lives of children when they are by themselves and involved in playthe activities, social partners, and interactions that form part of everyday experiences.Most research in psychology has been conducted on children in laboratory or laboratory-like situations or relied on parents' reports rather than examining children's typically occurring everyday activities (Tudge, Hogan, &Etz, 1999).The activities and interactions that comprise proximal processes may be the engines of development, but to understand interactions it is necessary to know something about the particular individuals involved in the interactions.Clearly, although studies of socialization often focus on what parents do with or for their children, it is also necessary to account for the fact that children are the agents of their own experiences.They influence their own environments: for example by initiating new activities, drawing others towards them, while at the same time being influenced by those around.Knowledge is to know or to be familiar about things that include facts, information, description or skills acquired through experiences and education.Knowledge acquisition is a complex cognitive process.Cognitive processes deal with learning and experiences.New knowledge is constructed by the developing human being when information comes into contact with existing knowledge developed by experiences.Construction of knowledge has been a vital concern among psychologists' specifically developmental psychologists.Among the eminent theorists of knowledge construction, the names of Jean Piaget, John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Maria Montessori and Barbara Rogoff are prominent. II. ConstructivismConstructivists believe that learners construct or build their own knowledge.Learning is not unidirectional rather it is based on previous experiences and knowledge of the person.Constructivism is an approach that claims that humans are better able to understand the information they have created by themselves.According to constructivist theories, learning is a social phenomenon that involves language, real world situations, and interaction and collaboration among people in a social setup.The learners are considered to be central and active participants in the learning process.Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky are two pre-eminent figures in the development of constructivist theories.They share the common belief that young children must learn by doing in real life situations.Development of the human beings is the result of two groups of factors: the heredity and biological adaptation factors, on which the evolution of the nervous system and elementary psychic mechanisms depend, and the transmission factors, or those of social interaction, which begin at the cradle and which play an ever increasingly important role during the course of growth, in the constitution of mental life and behaviour.To speak of a right to education thus means first to ascertain the essential parts played by social factors in the very formation of the individual (Piaget, 1973).However, there are important differences between their theories regarding to the process of learning.Piaget's developmental theory of learning and constructivism are based on discovery.According to Piaget's constructivist theory, in order to provide an ideal learning environment, children should be allowed to construct knowledge that is meaningful for them.Vygotsky, known for his theory of social constructivism, believed that learning and development are collaborative and that children's thinking develops in the context of socialization and education.The perceptual, attention, and memory capacities of children are transformed by vital cognitive tools provided by culture, such as history, social context, traditions, language, and religion.For learning to occur, the child is believed to first make contact with the social environment on an interpersonal level and then internalizes this experience.Vygotsky's constructivism is known as social constructivism because of the significance of culture and social context.For Vygotsky, the zone of proximal development --the distance between the actual development of a child as determined by independent problem solving, and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more advanced peers‖ (Vygotsky: 1978, p.92) suggests that cognitive development is limited to a certain range at a particular age.However, with the help of social interaction, such",

La perdida de autonomia y demanda de cuidados llevan a las personas mayores a considerar la alternativa de la institucionalizacion. La vulnerabilidad del residente y concepcion asilar predominante, deterioran la calidad de vida en muchos de estos centros, cuando solo atienden las dificultades para realizar las actividades de la vida diaria sin incorporar otras dimensiones estructurales del envejecimiento. La conquista del espacio para la intimidad y la socializacion en diferentes gradientes, es un aspecto muchas veces dificil de lograr con la infraestructura disponible en los edificios donde se alojan estas instituciones. El presente trabajo adopta un metodo de investigacion cuanti-cualitativo con el objeto de indagar acerca de las condiciones ambientales en las Residencias de larga estancia analizando: los requerimientos de las personas mayores institucionalizadas, los ambitos que resuelven esos requerimientos, la posible adaptacion de los entornos y las previsiones de la normativa vigente. Las personas mayores son especialmente vulnerables a las presiones ambientales, por eso las residencias de larga estancia, deben garantizar un adecuado desenvolvimiento de la vida privada y social de los residentes, brindando ambitos de calidad para posibilitar la realizacion de las actividades. The advanced aging process is one of the causes for the increase of the number of dependent people. Loss of autonomy and demand of care, drive people to consider institutionalization as an alternative. Residents' vulnerability and the predominant conception of “asylum”, decrease quality of life in many of these centers, where only problems of the everyday-life are attend without considering other structural dimensions of aging. The conquest of space for privacy and socialization in different levels is one aspect that is usually difficult to achieve with the available infrastructure in those buildings where these institutions are located. This work has adopted a qualitative/ quantitative investigative method with the aim of inquiring about the environmental conditions in long-stay residences, analyzing: Needs of institutionalized elder people; where those needs would be solved; what current legislation foresights, and possible adaptation of environments. Elder people are especially vulnerable to environmental pressure that is why long-stay residences must guarantee an adequate development of private and social life of residents, providing quality environments to enable the realization of their activities.",

The role of parenting mentally disabled adults may also impose undue stress on elderly persons. Objective and subjective parental burden, including fears for the patient's future, are increased by the mental health system's failure to offer education, support, training in problem solving, and a collaborative role in discharge planning to family members. Social policy implications of considering families as primary caregivers include the danger that government will be relieved of responsibility for care of the mentally ill, the creation of a potentially at-risk population among aging parents and other family members affected by the stresses of caregiving, and the reduction of the patient's potential for independent living.",

      "title": "Exploring links between attachment and mental health",
      "abstract": "Attachment theory provides numerous implications for mental health and individual functioning throughout the lifespan. Attachment styles, formed based on early interactions with a caregiver, play a crucial role in emotional regulation, relational satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Childhood experiences become the foundation for the development of internal models of self, the world, and others, influencing attachment patterns in adulthood. These patterns are significant for later relationships, especially romantic ones, mental health, and the development of psychopathology. If the primary caregiver responds consistently, supports, and comforts the child, the child will be inclined to cooperate, seek closeness, and feel loved and safe. Such a child will develop a secure attachment, viewing the caregiver as a secure base and a refuge from the unpredictable world. Individuals who formed a secure attachment style in childhood tend to create stable and mature relationships, exhibit greater psychological resilience, and are less likely to struggle with mental health issues. Conversely, if the caregiver is unresponsive or lacks sensitivity, the child may develop an insecure attachment style, characterized by heightened anxiety or avoidance. Attachment-related anxiety is associated with a persistent state of heightened vigilance, as individuals remain on alert, anticipating potential separation from their parents. Avoidant attachment is marked by a tendency to maintain emotional distance, reluctance to rely on others, and a lack of seeking comfort and support from caregivers. An insecure attachment style negatively impacts romantic relationships. Moreover, individuals characterized by attachment anxiety or avoidance are more prone to mental health disorders. Attachment theory provides a crucial framework for understanding the complex links between early relational experiences and mental health. Poor relationship quality, complex PTSD, depression, personality disorders—particularly antisocial and borderline—have their roots in early maladaptive relationships between the child and caregiver and may be related to interpersonal trauma. Secure attachment acts as a protective factor against psychopathologies, promoting emotional stability and healthy social functioning.",

The perceptions represent manifestations of inter- and intragroup levels of categorization in dealing with the other family member. The association between these group-oriented categorizations and perceptions of intergenerational contact outside of the family was examined. Participants (N� /369) completed questionnaires assessing perceptions of experiences with multiple grandparents. Findings showed that general family identification of the grandchild, parental encouragement, and personal communication (social support and reciprocal self-disclosure) are positively associated with perceptions of shared family identity, whereas intergroup communication (under/overaccommodation) and perceptions of impaired health are associated with age salience. Results suggest that age salience may moderate the relationship between shared family identity and perceptions of older adults in some circumstances.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe transition to separation is an important time for the re-configuration of family relationships and maintaining father involvement. Pre-separation family relationships may affect father involvement over this transition. This study examines associations among family relationship attributes prior to separation (father engagement, coparenting support, mothers' perceptions of paternal competence, marital status) and post-separation father involvement (contact, in-kind support, shared responsibility). Data were from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a large national survey with an oversampling of nonmarital births (Reichman et al., Citation2001). Included were mothers who lived with the father all or most of the time around a focal child's third birthday (Y3) and were separated from the father around the child's fifth birthday (Y5) (N = 371). Structural equation modeling results showed that family relationship attributes at Y3 were associated with post-separation father involvement at Y5. Mothers' perceptions of paternal competence were positively associated with contact. Coparenting support and unmarried parent status were associated with greater father responsibility, and father engagement was positively associated with in-kind support provision. Results held, even when controlling for structural factors concurrent with post-separation father involvement. Results suggest that different aspects of pre-separation relationships may differentially affect domains of father involvement after separation.KEYWORDS: Father involvementFamily relationshipsCoparentingSeparationDivorce Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

This study used longitudinal, ethnographic data from Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three‐City Study to explore experiences of low‐income, Latina adolescent mothers ( N = 15) with unstable housing who primarily rely on their families or the families of their significant others for housing support. Results of analysis employing grounded theory and narrative approaches suggested two types of instability: “Horizontal moves” between family homes and “vertical moves” between family homes and independent living. Although family support often was fundamental in allowing for participants’ pursuit of independent housing (i.e., vertical moves), it also was associated with greater residential mobility (i.e., horizontal moves), most often in the context of intrafamilial conflict and family instability. These results are discussed with respect to inconsistencies in policies to address this vulnerable population.",

The unplanned pregnancy, a strong reality for many young poor women in this country, provokes a strong impact on physical, emotional, socio‐economic and family dimensions. Research questions: Do personal characteristics determine the behaviours of males towards unplanned pregnancy? Do the associations between the couple’s bond and male behaviours influence attitudes towards unplanned pregnancy? Methods: This descriptive study was carried out in a low‐income community in the City of São Paulo, Brazil. A structured form was composed to obtain data from 100 women who have lived out the unplanned pregnancy experience. Findings: Personal characteristics do not appear to determine male behaviours towards unplanned pregnancy. There was a statistically significant difference among men in different types of bonding relationship (married, cohabiting, dating, without bonding) with regard to the following behaviours: attention given during pregnancy; changes to the type of bond between partners; civil registration of the child by the father; financial support provided by the father and contact with the child. Conclusions: Bonding and correlated topics are essential in sexual and reproductive healthcare education and promotion. Limitations: Population sampling was statistically calculated based on community demographic data and the conclusions refer to the estimated parameters of men’s behaviours according to women’s experiences.",

The study examined the parameters of social adaptation, autonomy, the locus of control in the field of achievements and interpersonal relationships, the need to maintain social ties, attitude towards vulnerable groups and readiness to create your own family. There are significant differences in the process of socialization of adolescents-orphans and their peers who are brought up in a family. In particular, teenage orphans have a low level of social adaptation, autonomy, and activity. School has little impact on the socialization process, and the teenage group has a strong impact. Orphans show low interest in education; a low need for real friends and a lack of confidence that they themselves can be real friends. Orphans are dominated by the external locus of control. They assume that romantic relationships can negatively affect their lives, while at the same time they approve of sexual relations among peers. Thus, the image of the world and social relations in the view of teenage orphans differs significantly from the image of the world of family children.",

Parental responses to adolescents’ negative affect likely shape how youth utilize peer relationships to regulate distress. On the one hand, nonsupportive parental responses to adolescents’ negative emotions may drive them to seek peer support via co-ruminating. Conversely, high levels of supportive parental responses are socially rewarding in ways that may reinforce support-seeking with peers in similar ways (leading to greater co-rumination). Eighty-nine healthy adolescents (9-17) and their mothers completed surveys and a support-seeking interaction. Only supportive maternal responses, including observed maternal affection, were associated with adolescents’ co-rumination. These analyses indicate that some forms of parental support may inadvertently reinforce co-rumination.",

      "title": "PENGARUH OVERPARENTING TERHADAP KEPRIBADIAN",
      "abstract": "Dalam perkembangannya, anak membutuhkan pengasuhan yang tepat dan sesuai dengan kebutuhan dan usianya agar berkembang secara maksimal. Pengasuhan orang tua berpengaruh atas pembentukan kepribadian anak. Dalam perkembangan hidupnya, terdapat tahap emerging adulthood, yakni tahap masa transisi dari selesainya masa remaja menuju dewasa muda. Ketika itu seorang anak berada pada msa melepaskan diri dari pengasuhan orang tua. Anak sedang berfokus dengan dirinya sendiri dan memiliki otonomi yang besar dalam menjalani kehidupannya, sehingga penting bagi orang tua untuk memberikan kesempatan bagi anak belajar mandiri. Keterlibatan orang tua yang berlebihan pada tahap perkembangan ini disebut overparenting. Hal ini terjadi karena orang tua menyadari peluangnya semakin singkat untuk mengasuh dan membantu anak mencapai potensi terbaiknya. Dampak pengasuhan ini antara lain: anak kehilangan otonomi atas dirinya, tingginya kecemasan serta stres, hingga mengembangkan trait negatif. Selain itu juga dapat menghambat anak dalam mengambil tanggung jawab terhadap dirinya sendiri, yang seharusnya perlu dikuasai anak menjelang memasuki masa dewasa. Individu yang terhambat oleh overparenting dan gagal memenuhi tuntutan psikologis, dikhawatirkan tidak mencapai kedewasaan secara sempurna, sebaliknya mengembangkan trait maladaptif. Penelitian menguji pengaruh overparenting terhadap terbentuknya trait kepribadian seseorang. Partisipan adalah 184 laki-laki dan perempuan (rerata usia 21.25 tahun). Pengumpulan data dengan Helicopter Parenting Instrument (HPI) dan NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Hasil pengujian menunjukkan bahwa overparenting dari ayah secara signifikan dapat menjadi predictor pembentukan trait Neuroticism pada dewasa muda (t-value = 1.97 &gt; 1.96, dengan p &lt; 0.05). Semakin tinggi pengasuhan overparenting ayah, maka semakin tinggi kemungkinan anak memiliki trait neuroticism di usia dewasa muda. Hasil ini sejalan penelitian Odenweller, Booth-Butterfield dan Weber (2014) serta Montgomery (dalam Bradley-Geist &amp; Olson-Buchanan, 2014), adanya hubungan antara overparenting dengan trait neurotisme. Sementara, overparenting ayah maupun ibu tidak berperan signifikan terhadap pembentukan trait lainnya (Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness serta Conscientiousness).",

      "abstract": "Keluarga merupakan lingkungan kehidupan yang dikenal anak untuk pertama kalinya, dan untuk seterusnya anak banyak belajar di dalam kehidupan keluarga. Oleh karena itu peran, sikap dan perilaku orangtua dalam proses pengasuhan anak, sangat besar pengaruhnya dalam pembentukan dan perkembangan kepribadian anak. Dengan kehadiran seorang anak dalam keluarga, komunikasi dalam keluarga menjadi lebih penting dan intensitasnya harus semakin meningkat, artinya dalam keluarga perlu ada komunikasi yang baik dan sesering mungkin antara orang tua dengan anak. Cukup banyak persoalan yang timbul di masyarakat karena atau tidak adanya komunikasi yang baik dalam keluarga. Dalam kenyataannya, proses interaksi anak dengan orangtua tidak selalu sesuai dengan yang diharapkan dan tidaklah sesederhana yang kita bayangkan dan katakan. Pengasuhan sering dibumbui oleh berbagai hal yang tidak mendukung bagi kemandirian anak, antara lain: sikap dan perilaku orangtua yang tidak dapat menjadi contoh bagi anak-anaknya, suasana emosi anggota rumah tangga sehari-hari yang tidak kondusif, serta interaksi anggota keluarga lainnya yang tidak baik. Dengan situasi seperti itu, maka tidak semua interaksi keluarga terhadap anak efektif, akibatnya, perilaku dan kemandirian anak, tidak sesuai dengan yang diharapkan. Faktor lingkungan, seperti kemajuan teknologi informasi dan globalisasi yang berkembang pesat dewasa ini sangat mempengaruhi nilai dan norma yang berlaku dalam individu, keluarga, dan masyarakat. Hal ini dapat berakibat terjadinya berbagai permasalahan sosial pada anak diantaranya; penyimpangan perilaku baik pada anak maupun pada orang dewasa, seperti tindak kekerasan, pencurian, pelecehan seksual, tawuran dan lain- lain yang menyebabkan anak berhadapan dengan hukum (ABH).",

      "title": "[The child's conflictual family environment].",
      "abstract": "The child's conflictual family environment. Children and adolescents currently experience multiple family situations that feed their psychological construction towards adulthood. Conflicts between parents or the separation of the parental couple mark a change in the family system. Different psychological mechanisms can describe this impact, including the feeling of vigilance, the perception of a potential danger, or the belief that the person is at fault and responsible for the disputes. They can be articulated around cognitive skills (how the child assesses and understands the conflict), emotional possibilities (through his or her ability to regulate emotions in the face of conflict) and behavioural skills (how the child or adolescent is involved in the conflict). To create this environment, the use of family mediation centres makes it possible to create new opportunities for communication between parents. Child protection actors must be notified when acts of violence are committed against the child or adolescent, or if they are exposed to violent marital conflicts. Mental health systems offer specific care when characterized disorders have been identified. The commitment of both parents is sought to provide a space for everyone to express themselves.Environnement familial conflictuel de l’enfant. Les enfants et les adolescents connaissent actuellement des situations familiales plurielles qui nourrissent leur construction psychique vers l’âge adulte. Les conflits entre les parents ou la séparation du couple parental viennent marquer un changement dans le système familial. Différents mécanismes psychologiques peuvent décrire ce retentissement, dont le sentiment de vigilance, la perception d’un danger potentiel, ou la croyance d’être fautif et responsable des disputes. Ils peuvent s’articuler autour de capacités cognitives (la façon dont l’enfant évalue et comprend le conflit), des possibilités affectives (par sa capacité à réguler les émotions face à un conflit) et comportementales (comment l’enfant ou l’adolescent s’implique dans le conflit). Pour aménager cet environnement, le recours aux centres de médiation familiale rend possibles de nouvelles possibilités de communication entre les parents. Les acteurs de protection de l’enfance doivent être saisis lorsque des actes de violence sont commis à l’encontre de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, ou si ces derniers sont exposés à des conflits conjugaux violents. Les dispositifs de santé mentale proposent des prises en charge spécifiques lorsque des troubles caractérisés ont été identifiés. L’engagement des deux parents est recherché, pour permettre un espace de parole à chacun.",

      "abstract": "Este trabalho aborda as políticas públicas direcionadas às crianças e adolescentes que vivenciam a perda do poder familiar e estão inseridas no Sistema Nacional de Adoção (SNA). O processo de adoção surge como medida de exceção a ser adotada pela Justiça, quando não for possível a aplicação de medidas mais brandas aos pais, de modo que não seja possível o retorno à convivência em família e a perda do poder familiar seja o mecanismo mais eficaz a fim de resguardar os direitos das crianças e/ou adolescentes. O processo de adoção seguirá com a criança/adolescente tendo que vivenciar duas separações: dos pais biológicos e dos cuidadores da instituição. E a situação ainda se agrava quando a adoção não acontece e ao completarem a maioridade esses adolescentes têm que ser desligados da instituição. De acordo com as Orientações Técnicas: serviços de acolhimento para crianças e adolescentes (BRASÍLIA, 2009), o adolescente que sair do abrigamento aos 18 anos e não tiver para onde ir deve ter resguardada a sua morada em repúblicas (moradias coletivas) custeadas pelo Estado para sua permanência até os 21 anos de idade. No entanto, essa realidade de garantia dessa política pública revela-se como um contraponto já que está distante da grande maioria dos municípios brasileiros que ainda não têm este serviço a ser ofertado. Esta temática faz parte do objeto de uma pesquisa de doutorado em andamento, na qual, para a elucidação do tema, faz-se a análise de algumas particularidades que se referem ao processo de adoção, sob a ótica de que trata a Legislação Brasileira, o ECA. E tem como objetivo analisar as políticas públicas voltadas à criança e/ou adolescente institucionalizados que aguardam o processo de adoção. Busca-se também compreender o universo que envolve os casos em que as crianças perpassam anos na instituição e não são adotadas e de que forma as políticas públicas resguardam os direitos destas crianças/adolescentes. Para realizar esta pesquisa, buscou-se fazer uma revisão da literatura teórica alicerçada na legislação e doutrina pátrias que abordam o tema, com base no método histórico e tendo como parâmetro a análise qualitativa dos dados. Por fim, depreende-se dos resultados da pesquisa que as políticas públicas existentes ainda não são eficazes no sentido de resguardar a proteção das crianças e adolescentes institucionalizados, bem como o/a jovem, que não foi adotado (a) na infância, tem que sair da instituição e viver por conta própria.",

      "title": "Preserving the Families of Homeless and Housing-Insecure Parents",
      "abstract": "Every year in the United States, state child welfare agencies receive millions of reports of suspected child abuse and neglect. The families involved in these reports are often first subjected to government interference in the legally protected parent-child relationship on the basis of “neglect,” a legal concept that lacks an intent standard and is often difficult to separate from a parent’s poverty and consequent inability to provide for a child’s physical needs. Children of families experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity are especially vulnerable to removal to foster care due to their lack of safe housing. After removal, it becomes increasingly difficult for a homeless parent to hold onto his parental rights while his child languishes in foster care, often with a caregiver who is a complete stranger. Although federal law requires states to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal or return a child to her home, reasonable efforts rarely include housing assistance. Meanwhile, states receive uncapped federal funding for foster care services, which include room-and-board payments to foster homes. Providing uncapped funding for foster care but little meaningful assistance to a child’s parent stacks the deck in favor of termination of parental rights in cases where the primary barrier to family reunification is a lack of safe housing.\r\n\r\nEven for the small number of children in foster care for whom adoption is the best or only option, the number of adoptive families remains low despite efforts at the federal and state levels to encourage adoption. Congress continues to approach the problem by attempting to make adoption quicker and easier in order to increase the supply of available adoptive families, but there continues to be an enormous shortfall in the availability of adoptive homes for children in foster care. Furthermore, entry into foster care—even for a few days—is an adverse, disruptive, and jarring experience for children and families that should be avoided whenever possible. By reducing the number of children removed from their homes in the first place and therefore reducing the demand for adoptive families, the law can reduce the disparity between the number of children awaiting adoption and the available adoptive homes, promote racial and class justice, and breathe life back into the constitutional right of poor but otherwise fit parents to raise their children as they please. Requiring reasonable efforts to include housing assistance will prevent removals, and federal funding can be repurposed to serve the stated goals of child welfare law.",

      "title": "Self‐ambivalence: Naming a contemporary work–family problem that has no name",
      "abstract": "Summary As workers and family members, individuals ought to celebrate seemingly positive events (e.g., a promotion and the purchase of a home). Yet, the numerous identities that contemporary workers hold increase the likelihood of an event that is pleasant in one domain being problematic in another and more cognitively and affectively complex than anticipated. We theorize that these events are likely to prompt self‐evaluations that are positive (“I'm a success!”) and negative (“I'm a failure.”) across one's identity set, with questions such as “Who have I become?” and “Is this who I ought to be?” The result is self‐ambivalence, that is, a simultaneously oppositional orientation toward oneself. We view this as a contemporary cognitive and affective experience for which theorizing in work and family is largely absent. Our conceptual model begins with “work–family ought events,” events accompanied by both possibilities and limitations that prompt identity‐related self‐examination. We acknowledge the influence of multi‐level social systems including organizational, societal, individual, and partner factors, which can intensify self‐ambivalence. We propose the experience of self‐ambivalence has implications for self‐concept clarity and ultimately well‐being in both the work and family domains and extend theory on this problem of self‐ambivalence, a problem that heretofore “had no name.”",

      "abstract": "Abstract Family complexity in the form of step-relationships are increasing across cohorts. Filial obligation, or the social norm that adult children should care for aging parents, are generally weaker in stepfamilies. Further, gender continues to be a main axis of stratification of who provides care within families. Taken together, we test whether biological versus step ties, the gender of the adult child, and the interaction between these two factors are associated with helping aging parents (ages 65 and older) with functional or health limitation based care needs. We use Round 5 (2015) of the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Results illustrate the enduring strength of both biological and gendered ties, with biological daughters being the most likely to help an aging parent, followed by biological sons, step-daughters, and lastly step-sons. This pattern holds even when we control for important characteristics of both the adult child and the care receiver. As families become more complex, these findings could mean that gaps in unmet care needs will emerge, especially for older adults who only have stepchildren.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A growing older adult population living longer provides opportunities for greater age-integration, which includes reducing age-related structural barriers and increasing cross-age interactions (Riley &amp; Riley, 2000). While research on the theoretical construct of age-integration is prevalent, empirical evidence of age-integration in older adults’ social networks is lacking (Hagestad &amp; Uhlenburg, 2005). This study uses the National Health and Aging Trends Study to quantify and characterize age-integrated social networks in the United States, and to understand the sociodemographic predictors of these age-integrated relationships. Participants’ social networks, comprised of respondents’ spouses, household members, children, helpers, care recipients, and up to five individuals they share important things with were considered age-integrated if individuals were at least 10 years younger than the respondent. About 96% of respondents reported at least one person 10+ years younger than them. Further, these relationships were coded as familial (i.e., spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, and other relatives) and non-familial relationships (i.e., other non-relatives) and analyses predicting age-integrated relationships as a function of sociodemographic characteristics were stratified by relationship type. Weighted multilevel logistic regression analyses suggest that females have lower odds of familial and non-familial age-integration than males; compared to white and married individuals, Black and Hispanic individuals have greater odds of familial and non-familial age-integration; compared to married individuals, separated, divorced, and widowed individuals have greater odds of familial age-integration, and those who were never married have greater odds of non-familial age-integration. This foundational study reveals that sociodemographic factors differentially predict familial and non-familial age-integrated social networks.",

Generally, mothers' activities did not positively covary at either age, nor did those of infants. Some maternal activities were stable in this time period; some developmentally increased, and some developmentally decreased. Infants' activities were unstable, but most increased over time. Specific mother and infant activities corresponded, and over time mothers and infants influenced one another in specific ways. In the critical period of the first half year, infants appear to be flexible and plastic in their behavioral repertoires and are influenced by their mothers; mothers are somewhat consistent, but they also adapt to the behaviors of their infants.",

      "abstract": "Chaque annee au Quebec, pres de 30 000 enfants sont confies aux services sociaux puisque leur developpement ou leur securite sont juges compromis. Le principal motif de prise en charge par la Direction de la protection de la jeunesse (DPJ) est la negligence, laquelle est suivie du risque serieux de negligence, de mauvais traitements psychologiques, des troubles de comportement serieux et des abus physiques. Dans ce sens, avant meme qu’ils soient places, ces enfants presentent de nombreux facteurs de risque compte tenu des experiences negatives qu’ils ont vecues dans leur famille d’origine. A ces facteurs de risque vient s’ajouter le placement, qui peut avoir divers impacts sur le jeune en raison de la rupture relationnelle qu’il occasionne avec ses figures d’attachement principales (Clausen et coll., 1998 ; Rosenfeld et coll., 1997). Principalement, cette discontinuite affective peut nuire au developpement de l’attachement de l’enfant (Dozier et coll., 2002 ; Stovall et Dozier, 2000). Dans le cadre de cette etude, nous nous sommes interesses aux styles d’attachement et aux perceptions de soi et des autres de jeunes adultes ayant ete heberges en famille d’accueil. Cette etude visait a documenter les images que portent les repondants face a eux-memes et face aux relations qu’ils entretiennent avec les differents membres de leur entourage. Elle visait egalement a documenter les styles d’attachement de ces derniers. Finalement, cette etude a permis d’identifier les moyens utilises par les repondants et par les differents milieux d’accueil pour favoriser la creation de liens significatifs ou positifs entre eux. Ces objectifs ont ete analyses a partir de la theorie de l’attachement de Bowlby (1969) ainsi que de certaines notions de la theorie du parcours de vie. Pour ce faire, une etude qualitative de type exploratoire a ete menee aupres d’un echantillon de huit jeunes adultes âges entre 18 et 35 ans et ayant vecu dans une famille d’accueil durant leur jeunesse. Plus specifiquement, les donnees ont ete collectees a l’aide d’entrevues semi-dirigees menees aupres de participants recrutes sur une base volontaire afin de recueillir la perception qu’ils ont de leurs experiences de placement. Les resultats de l’etude demontrent des representations de soi et des autres majoritairement positives chez les repondants, ce qui peut etre attribuable a leurs experiences positives en milieu d’accueil. De plus, conformement aux autres etudes sur le sujet, la grande majorite des repondants presentent des attachements insecurisants, principalement de style desorganise. Finalement, les donnees recueillies ont permis d’identifier la patience, l’ecoute et la communication de la part des parents d’accueil comme principaux moyens permettant l’etablissement d’un lien affectif satisfaisant. Les resultats de cette etude permettent donc l’acquisition de connaissances sur le vecu de ces jeunes dans leur famille d’origine, dans les milieux d’accueil, ainsi que dans les diverses relations qu’ils entretiennent avec les membres de leur entourage a l’âge adulte, mais egalement sur les besoins de ces derniers relativement au developpement de leur style d’attachement. Ainsi, cette etude permet de suggerer des pistes quant a l’orientation que devraient prendre les interventions aupres de ce type de jeunes, mais egalement aupres des parents d’accueil.",

Older adults tend to adopt a “not‐listening,” “disapproving,” or “over‐protecting” style when interacting with young adults.

First, families reflect and pass on the surrounding culture, leading to cross‐cultural differences between families. Family is the place where culture is learned, and families, in a small way, develop their own “cultures.” Second, intercultural communication—that is, communication between members of different cultures—can occur in families in several instances: in cases where the parents are from different cultures; when the children learn a different culture from the family, such as in cases of immigration or globalization (through media use etc.); or in colonized or diasporic cultures. And third, culture impacts families through external stigma toward certain familial relationships. Intergroup research considers societal opposition to families or family members which can occur on different grounds: society opposes the ethnic or religious group of the family; society opposes intermarriage between in‐ and outgroup members; or society opposes the type of union (e.g., same‐sex couple).",

      "abstract": "In ecologic system, the family surrounded by micro-mezzo-macro environments undergoes changes and developments as a result of changing social, psychological and economic states. In living conditions getting more complex role conflicts, changing family structures (split family, single parent family etc.), transition from traditional roles to modern and even postmodern relation patterns, socio-economic situation (rural-urban) profoundly affect the family of every form (nucleus or extended family). Hence, the family needs external support throughout many processes including normal and abnormal developments. In this line, the present study deals with one of the support services needed by the family; that is, the approach to family treatment, the content of this treatment, its availability and the extent to which it achieves its objectives. The study will discuss the existing practices and suggest a model for family psycho-social support unit to be located in family health centers. Moreover, psycho-social dimension of general health which is usually overlooked will be emphasized and in this way, a holistic approach to health will be adopted.",

      "abstract": "Quantitative and qualitative data from independent older adults were used to explore salient aspects of their parenting role, including (1) change over time, (2) current need for the role, (3) current expectations of adult children, and (4) rights and responsibilities of older parents. Perceptions of stability in the parent role focused on enduring responsibilities and biological and emotional ties. The role changed in terms of social and cultural transitions over family time, relinquishment of certain responsibilities, and emergence of status equality. Expectations of children centered on affection, assistance, respect, responsibility, and open communication. Desired relationships with adult children were characterized by warmth, sharing, affection, and avoidance of direct interference in each others' lives. Family practitioners are encouraged to address issues of planning and decision making around topics such as long-term care, medical intervention, and wills.",

      "abstract": "A la notion de vacances est le plus souvent associée, tant dans les représentations collectives que dans la logique des politiques d'aide sociale, l'idée de départ. Cette vision dominante est aussi celle qui circonscrit le temps des vacances à ses manifestations pratiques, abordées principalement à partir des destinations et des formes de séjours des vacanciers. Ce faisant, cette approche néglige de prendre en compte ce qui précède (rêves et projets) ou prolonge (récits et souvenirs) le moment même des vacances et ne permet pas d'apprécier les significations du non-départ. Les déterminants socio- économiques sont invoqués, souvent sans autre forme d'analyse, pour expliquer la sédentarité estivale. Sans sous-estimer l'impact des nécessités économiques sur les pratiques vacancières, une enquête réalisée auprès d'un échantillon d'allocataires ayant droit aux bons vacances de la caisse d'Allocations familiales montre, outre la prégnance des valeurs vacancières dans la vie quotidienne, une grande diversité de rapport au temps de vacances chez les familles non partantes. Certaines familles font preuve d'une relative autonomie de fonctionnement et de valeurs, non par le fait qu'elles ne partent pas mais parce qu'elles opposent au modèle du séjour vacancier d'autres goûts et d'autres pratiques d'une culture populaire d'occupation du temps.",

In the third situation, however, the bells and whistles of the push-button toy deprive the baby of chances to develop the motivation and skills for connecting with self or others. Vast sums of money are spent every year selling products to children and their parents. The products are usually created to make money, not necessarily to promote the well-being of children. The media and commercial cultures make children's interactions with objects and people more rote and programmed. In the past, children had more opportunities for social interactions through which they could the feel and observe the effects of their behaviour on others. The marketing to girls of sexualized appearance also influences their behaviour and relationships. Aggressive commercial culture makes the process of parenting and enabling secure attachments with children difficult.",

      "abstract": "Sexual abuse of a child is a special form of trauma. As McCarthy (1986) has reported, it probably begins at a much younger age than the child remembers, so that he or she grows up accepting that this is part of life. It is an important part of the environment which affects the child's psychic development. It usually occurs against the background of a cold, sick or absent mother, and a family in which there is little true affection or understanding. It is often accompanied by physical abuse. There may also be an element of psychological abuse which has been called `soul murder' (Shengold, 1979; Miller,1983; Hall, 1987). But even without this-there will always be confusion in the child's mind, `How CAN he do this to me, when he is a grown-up, respected by the other grown-ups, and should love and protect me?' or, `How can my parent ALLOW him to do this to me?' The mystification is increased if the perpetrator is the one person in the family who has given the child any genuine affection.",

Therefore, these two facts (the importance of the relationships and lack of them) speak for themselves. That is the reason why we have studied three indicators of family ties (visits, outings, and stays in the family home) that these families have with the users of the services. We have also considered some factors of them (level of psychological development, behaviour problems…) and those of the families (age of the parents, brothers and sisters…) with the purpose of establishing the possible ef fect of them on the contacts.",

      "abstract": "As family structures diversify, attitudes towards “nontraditional” families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as “family.” In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional family—but did not affect evaluations of a traditional family—relative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people’s views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to examine changes in family involvement following a relative's move to a long-term care facility as well as factors associated with these changes. Qualitative data, using in-depth, active interviews were gathered from 35 family members at two points in time following a relative's move to a facility. Findings showed some changes in contact that were related to personal, social, institutional, and health conditions. Occasionally, new types of care were provided; more often care was rebalanced or expressed in alternative ways. The majority of participants did not view themselves as caregivers, a perception that remained stable over time. Consistent with continuity theory, families, in most cases, tended to seek ways to maintain consistency in their roles as family members and carers, particularly in the first year or so after placement. Nonetheless, facility staff should be aware of the factors that might influence changes over time in family caregiving roles and offer support to families dealing with these issues.",

      "abstract": "We studied parents' direct involvement in adolescent sibling relationships, including parents' reactions to sibling conflict and their time spent in the company of the sibling dyad. Participants were 185 White, working‐ and middle‐class families; firstborns averaged 15 and secondborns averaged 13.5 years of age. In separate home interviews mothers, fathers and both adolescents described their personal and family relationship qualities and experiences. In a series of 7 evening phone calls, family members reported on each day's activities including the time they spent and their companions in 63 daily activities (e.g., do dishes, play sports, talk on phone). Analyses revealed 3 general conflict reactions by parents: (a) noninvolvement (e.g., tell siblings to work out problem themselves); (b) intervene (e.g., step in and solve problem); and (c) coach (e.g., give advice about how to solve problem). We found mother‐father differences in conflict reactions and time spent with siblings; differences in parents' direct involvement as a function of the gender constellation of the sibling dyad also were evident. Direct involvement was linked to sibling relationship qualities and explained variance beyond that accounted for by an index of indirect involvement, that is, parental warmth. Further, parents' orientations toward autonomy were linked to the indices of involvement such that parents with stronger autonomy orientations were less involved, and parents' orientations explained variance in their involvement beyond that explained by adolescent characteristics.",

Results showed preschooler taxonomic knowledge to be restricted to slot-filler categories. Conventional horizontal relations and vertical taxonomic knowledge emerged with age.

On the one hand it refers to services other than cash payments which are designed to meet some kind of social dependency or deviant behaviour; on the other hand, in the sense of 'welfare case', it refers to the situation of people who rely on, or are judged to need, or are constrained by such services. Thus in speaking of welfare we are concerned with the social care — as distinct from financial assistance, medical attention or education — available for those who are dependent on others for this kind of support in childhood or old age, or through some physical or mental handicap, and for those who offend against public norms of behaviour and respectability. For the most part the rearing of children and the care of the old and handicapped is a family matter. But the system of family support may break down, sometimes due to the separation or death of parents, sometimes because the family cannot or will not provide the skill or time demanded by an old or handicapped person, sometimes because standards of care fall below the level commonly regarded as acceptable.",

More recently, it has also become apparent that fathers themselves often feel overlooked by both researchers and practitioners in social and educational field. The outcome of a long history of lack of this issues – fatherhood and disability – is that we relatively little is known about fathers’ experiences and their involvement in raising a child with a disability. In addition, the educational role of fathers with a disabled child has shifted in tandem with the social role of women and with the societal and cultural changes, in the 1960s. Starting from this scenario and to reflect recent changes in families and in fatherhood as well, it would be beneficial to rethink the services in an inclusive approach, such as to include and meet the needs of all families (included those with a disabled child) in order to promote a social inclusion in ordinary contexts and not in separate ones.",

      "title": "Zusammenleben der Generationen und Perspektiven der Generationenarbeit",
      "abstract": "Usually the public media depict intergenerational relationships as loosely bound and distant. In this view elderly people would live single and separated from their offspring, weak family ties in general would manifest themselves in a weak relationship to the elderly parents and little exchange of help and mutual support. This widespread public image is corrected by the report. In a first step the demographic development is outlined and the thesis about a coming war between the is discussed. In a second step information about the living conditions of the elderly in different households which are important preconditions for intergenerational relationships are given. In the third part the report deals with intergenerational relationships with reference to historical new development towards overlapping lifecycles in this century. Regarding geographical distance and contacts, in the average population we cannot speak about deficits. The majority lives together closely. Although it is not common among elderly parents to share a household with adult children, they have regular contact. But there is a minority living in a greater distance and with rare contacts. Emotional relationships are close, especially between daughter and mother. Again, certain groups will not show this pattern. The mentioned closeness does not prevent conflicts. Social support follows a specific pattern. The generation in the middle has more exchange with own offspring and vice versa. Concerning the need for support in the older population, a spouse or a partner is of primary importance in most areas. But elderly who are widowed or living without a partner will refer to their children as the primary helpers. Most of social support is given within the family, especially by the middle generation. The report outlines the necessity for professional care services as well as the use of the German care insurance. An elaborated system of social support and medical care for elderly people exists. But regarding the impact of demographic changes, this system in its current shape is hardly capable of replacing family ties. Thus the necessity to develop intergenerational contacts and mutual help outside the family is outlined in chapter six. In a “greying society” we need to support the contacts between generations beyond the boundaries of families. Therefore in the last chapter, the report deals with approaches to intergenerational work that aim at supporting the dialog between generations. Models in Bavaria are presented to generate the motivation for a further growth of intergenerational work. ifb – Materialien 11-2001 10",

Differences in bed sharing practices among races. <b>Results</b> : Of the infants who died of the syndrome, 45 (22.4%) were sharing a bed. Daytime bed sharing was more common in African-American (P&lt;0.001) and Latin American families (P&lt;0.001) than in white families. The overall adjusted odds ratio for the syndrome and routine bed sharing in the daytime was 1.38 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 3.22) and for night was 1.21 (0.59 to 2.48). These odds ratios were adjusted for routine sleep position, passive smoking, breast feeding, intercom use, infant birth weight, medical conditions at birth, and maternal age and education. There was no interaction between bed sharing and passive smoking or alcohol use by either parent. <b>Conclusions</b> : Although there was a significant difference between bed sharing among African-American and Latin American parents compared with white parents, there was no significant relation between routine bed sharing and the sudden infant death syndrome.",

No entanto, para muitos casos, boa parte dos problemas comportamentais e de saude pode ser prevista e evitada antes da adocao, a medida que os tutores tenham acesso a esse tipo de conhecimento, estando preparados para lidar com as mais variadas possibilidades. Assim, um programa preventivo de educacao, focado na escolha do animal mais adequado para o adotante e, consequentemente, do adotante mais adequado para o animal, antes de sua adocao/aquisicao, podera propiciar a reducao da taxa de abandono. O projeto propoe um conjunto de acoes que visam a diminuir o desconhecimento da populacao interessada em incluir um animal de companhia no lar, proporcionando, assim, a posse responsavel e com maior chance de sucesso quanto ao preenchimento das expectativas dos adotantes e das necessidades dos animais. Essas acoes terao dois focos principais: 1) a informacao sobre tendencias de comportamento, habilidades esperadas (mitos e verdades) e demandas de cada animal, segundo a idade, o tamanho e a raca, alem das necessidades de espaco, demandas de atencao e atividades diarias para a manutencao de um animal saudavel e equilibrado; e 2) as informacoes basicas sobre os cuidados e desafios no processo de criacao animal, com a difusao dos criterios para que o adotante escolha locais qualificados para aquisicao de filhotes, no que se refere a conceitos basicos de melhoramento genetico utilizados no processo de criacao. A execucao dessa proposta preve a criacao de um site, alocado na pagina do curso de Medicina Veterinaria da Uniritter, em que as informacoes estarao disponiveis, utilizando-se de recursos ludicos e educativos, como jogos digitais para que as demandas do animal e as expectativas familiares sejam compativeis e assegurem uma convivencia harmonica. Alem disto, estao previstas acoes de extensao na comunidade para a divulgacao dessas informacoes e do proprio site. A participacao de estudantes de Medicina Veterinaria ocorrera em ambas acoes, sempre orientadas pelos professores executores do projeto. Os alunos realizaram uma pesquisa bibliografica sobre comportamentos e doencas geneticas, e tambem sobre estrategias utilizadas no processo de cruzamento, para diminuir a chance de ocorrencia de doencas nos filhotes e para promover sua saude e bem- -estar. Eles tambem participarao da confeccao de textos que alimentarao o site e das acoes na comunidade, como a divulgacao em escolas de ensino medio e fundamental. Com essa proposta de extensao, espera-se que a populacao torne-se, gradualmente, mais informada sobre o assunto, e que essa educacao contribua para uma adocao mais consciente e responsavel, diminuindo, assim, o abandono dos animais de companhia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A case study of community psychology consultation illustrates the assessment, collaboration, and organizing activities dictated by an open-systems, ecologically oriented approach to building structures that bridge the gap between school and community. Three types of participation structures are identified: (a) family to school communication; (b) communication among families; and (c) an active, family-run organization. Bridging activities include special event and program planning along with spontaneous moments of opportunity that express family and neighborhood interests. The entry, assessment, and development of bridging activities in search for more permanent structures is described in the context of the school district and its historical relation to the neighborhood. Questions addressed include, How can low-income families be involved in schools in ways that benefit both their own empowerment and the well-being of their children? Where do barriers exist for meaningful participation of families in schools? What are the characteristics of meaningful family involvement?",

The implications are considered regarding the likelihood that the concurrent stresses of the death and the birth, two major events in the family life cycle, could confound and impede mourning and parenting processes. Two hypotheses are suggested: (a) that a bereaved parent may be emotionally unavailable to spouse and infant, and (b) that attention to the child may block mourning and absorb painful feelings, with the child assuming a special replacement role. The dysfunctional potential is related to other interacting variables, including biological factors, mourning resolution, and the family system. Further study is called for.",

Often, these problems are inadequately addressed in the family environ- ment or may even have originated within the family itself. Because fami- lies are the first point of a child’s social contact, it is essential that parents understand the critical role they play in their children’s development and that they be equipped with the information and skills necessary to raise healthy and well-adapted children. Improving parenting practices and the family environment is the most effective and enduring strategy for combating juvenile delinquency and associated behavioral, social, and emotional problems. Accordingly, society should promote learning opportunities for successful parenting.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter explores how the prevailing psychologisation of challenging behaviour relies on a construction of inadequate parenting. Home life was cited by teachers’ to make sense of conflict in the classroom and was viewed as an influence to be countered and compensated for through an active process of ‘inclusion’. Accusations of bad parenting will be traced back to specific examples to emphasise the gap between institutional assumptions about family life and everyday lived experience. Attention will be drawn to the often invisible labour parents undertook to address their children’s problems and way particular challenges (poverty, insecurity, homelessness, ill health etc.) shaped and limited school engagement. The chapter will also address the central importance of family to the young people attending behaviour support units. No other theme in the research aroused as much passion or pride. Young men in particular experienced relationships with their mothers as intensely personal and precious and were highly sensitive and protective about their family relationships. The chapter addresses the contradictions and often volatile tensions associated with the invocation of family in a classroom setting and the problematic place home occupies in the current inclusion agenda.",

Significant main effects included the rate of emotion talk from fathers' romantic partners (i.e., the infant's mother), infant attention and distress, and sensitive parenting. Significant interactions were also found. Higher income African American fathers referred to negative emotions more than non-African American higher income fathers. In addition, African American fathers who demonstrated more negative and intrusive parenting referred to positive emotions more than non-African American fathers who demonstrated negative and intrusive parenting. Our findings support family systems theory and, specifically, the interdependence of individuals' behaviors within the family unit. Interaction effects are discussed with respect to cultural variation in beliefs about parenting behaviors and the cultural experience of African Americans, including the Black cultural experience and the minority experience.",

      "abstract": "Family meals provide opportunities to observe a variety of social exchanges. This study examined the occurrence of conflict and negotiation during the understudied context of family meals, examining both mother-child and father-child interactions with children aged 3-5 (n = 65). We investigated differences in parents' sensitivity and children's affect based on the occurrence of conflict and negotiation. Results indicated conflict was common with both parents, but particularly with mothers. Negotiation occurred less often: half of the time with mothers and a third of the time with fathers. Mothers were less sensitive and children more negative when mother-child conflict occurred; mothers were more sensitive when father-child conflict occurred. Fathers were more responsive when father-child conflict occurred, but more intrusive when both mother-child and father-child conflict occurred. Mother-child negotiation was associated with responsive mothers; mothers were less negative when mother-child negotiation occurred in the absence of father-child negotiation. Findings provide a deeper understanding of family interactions between young children and parents during family meals. These interactional processes may be an essential ingredient to better understand how family meals affect young children's health and well-being.

      "abstract": "Lone caregivers derive from families with low conformity and conversation. Regular exchanges of interaction are not part of their family experience, nor are ritualized dates, behaviors, and times together. The members of this family group are stars in the same constellation but have no responsibility or time dedicated to one another. LOW/COLD conformity is demonstrated through a lack of consistency in family rules, sharing beliefs that demonstrate inequity, not recognizing protected family times/rituals, and avoiding the cultivation of family closeness. LOW/COLD communication is characterized by low expectation for agreement and assimilation in conversational topics and frequency of interaction. The dyadic dynamic with the care recipient may serve to be its own significant support for some Lone caregivers. These two collaborators, in some care situations, may share the burdens of decision-making, planning, and even care management. The absence of a family support network moves the Lone caregiver outside of family structures to develop resources and help in caregiving. Healthcare providers and system resources are especially vital in supporting care decisions, goals, and self-care. The Lone caregiver has high levels of facility with information seeking and care navigation/pursuit and presents to others as seeking of the most effective physical relief for the care recipient. This caregiver is particularly bound to the care recipient, vigilant about an unfolding disease path, and in high need of self-care resources and respite.",

      "abstract": "Foster placements are more likely to break down where the foster carers already have birth children. Studies that explore the impact of fostering on foster carers and their birth children have suggested that relational changes occur, but these changes have not been examined in depth. This study aimed to explore the impact of fostering on parent–child relationships within foster families. Nine foster carers (including three couples) were interviewed separately, and the data were analysed using constructivist grounded theory methods. Analysis indicated that birth children may attribute particular importance to their position in the family (e.g. oldest child, youngest child) and that this is a key element of the way in which they relate to their parents. Emotional security and parent–child relationships can therefore be strained by a foster placement not taking this into account. Foster children also introduce significant competition for parental resources, putting a strain on relationships. Foster carers seem to prioritise, consciously or not, the preservation of relationships within the biological family. Reflecting on relationships and making changes to maximise potential improvements in relationships can lead to positive outcomes, and this can have an impact on whether families continue fostering or not.",

Yet, limited research has examined the interrelationships between caregiving status, gender, age and health, or how dimensions of caregiving (type of care, relationship with care recipient) complicate these relationships. Using data from 428,395 U.S. adults from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), I find that young adult men and women providing personal care report poorer self-rated health than noncaregivers. Regarding the relationship with care recipient, young adults caring for a spouse/partner report the poorest self-rated health, and particularly women. Overall, caregiving tends to be more adversely associated with health among young adults when the type of care provided is personal or when they have an ill spouse/partner to care for, both of which can be construed as off-timed from the life course perspective.",

Il legame con il coniuge viene stravolto e i caregiver, pervasi da sentimenti di impotenza, rabbia e colpa, ricorrono frequentemente a meccanismi di difesa quali l’agito, il diniego e la negazione. Nella nostra esperienza il dispositivo del gruppo omogeneo a tempo limitato favorisce l’elaborazione di questi vissuti grazie all’attivazione di fattori terapeutici quali l’universalita, l’informazione, l’apprendimento interpersonale e la coesione di gruppo. Il dispositivo gruppale e l’attivazione di questi fattori terapeutici consentono ai familiari la sospensione dal fare, dalle emergenze e dalle stimolazioni che i pazienti traumatizzati inesorabilmente e contuativamente sollecitano: episodi di trattamento (Fasolo, 2002) che offrono una possibilita trasformativa dei vissuti di colpa e impotenza in vissuti di rassegnazione e adattamento alla nuova situazione.",

      "abstract": "The social relationships of youth transitioning out of foster care into adulthood are examined. This examination includes a systematic review of existing work, both theory and research, creating a comprehensive picture of the preparation of youth for leaving care, and what happens to their relationships after they leave care. The problems that foster youth have with the transitioning out of foster care are documented, but a resiliency characteristic that transitioning youth possess is that they are likely to be ensconced in social networks that are a possible source of social support. The research converges on regarding mentors, particularly natural mentors, as a means of meeting the need that transitioning youth have for a relationship with a supportive adult. Strategies for improving after-care outcomes are provided. An argument is made for having a more realistic view of preparing youth to leave care by replacing the independence paradigm with an interdependence perspective. This perspective calls for helping youth construct supportive relationships with others, and extending foster care supports into early adulthood. This extension with continued support is viewed as congruent with what that most transition age youth receive who have never been in foster care receive from their parents.",

      "title": "6 The Family and Adolescent Issues",
      "abstract": "The Family and Adolescent IssuesIn the previous chapter we looked at some of the potential outcomes of parental divorce for adolescents.In this chapter we explore more fully a range of family issues that can affect the outcomes and behaviours of adolescents.Conflict with parents is common in adolescence, and some would suggest that it is essential.At least in early adolescence, conflict is relatively common, and moderate conflict between parents and adolescents seems to be linked to better psychological adjustment than high or no conflict (Adams & Laursen, 2001).Conflict seems to be important to successful individuation, as relationships between parents and adolescents are transformed and adolescents obtain a stronger sense of their own identity and the need for more control over their lives (see also Chapter 2 on individuation).Adolescents can also experience negative mood states as they move through this stage of their lives (Larson, Moneta, Richards & Wilson, 2002) and these negative moods can have an impact on the whole family.One of the major concerns of parents of adolescents is the problem behaviour that adolescents can become involved in.It's important to remember, however, that most adolescents do not become involved in seriously problematic behaviour.Most adolescents find other more appropriate ways to exert their independence, which is very important at this stage of life, although not always welcomed by parents.Many people believe, rightly so, that adolescents tend to get a bad press.One issue is that the media continually focus on a small number of 'bad apples' and ignore the positive behaviour of most adolescents.While acknowledging that adolescents do tend to get an unnecessarily bad press and that negative stereotypes are rife in the media, it is nevertheless important to recognise that there are a lot of potential traps for adolescents involved in youth culture in the 21 st century.In addition, getting involved in these problem behaviours may have implications for the rest of a teenager's life.Probably the issues that concern parents most are drug abuse and teenage pregnancy, because both of these problems have far-reaching consequences, affecting educational opportunities, employment possibilities, romantic and family relationships and, particularly in the case of drug abuse, health.In this chapter, we explore research on a range of potential problem behaviours including involvement in alcohol and illegal drugs, smoking, issues around sexuality such as early sexual involvement, teenage pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases, depression and suicidal behaviour, eating disorders, and conduct disorder, aggression and delinquency.In each case, we explore family factors that are likely to increase or decrease the probability that young people will become involved in these behaviours.In exploring these issues, we will be seeking to highlight the contexts in which the problems are likely to arise and look for ways they might be avoided.Our hope is that many of these problems will be avoided as parents and other adolescent workers become more aware of the ways these problems can be prevented.",

The numbers, characteristics and care experiences of children in foster and adoptive care were considered. The study found that for the majority of children placement in foster care led to separation from siblings. The children were most vulnerable to separation at points of entry and leaving care. Separation from brothers and sisters can have lifelong consequences for the child and his or her siblings, as few of the children were found to have plans which included reunification with their siblings. A fragmented picture emerged concerning siblings' living situations. Children were found to have siblings living in a variety of situations, both in and outwith the care system. Social workers lacked full information about the family composition where contact with parents was lost or siblings had moved from the area. Children were most likely to be placed with siblings in temporary and relative foster placements.",

      "title": "Attachment Style With Mother, Father, Best Friend, and Romantic Partner During Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Self‐reported attachment styles with mother, father, best friend, and romantic partner were assessed longitudinally across adolescence. Three cohorts (ages 13, 16, and 19 years; N =373) from a community sample were followed across 2 years. There was only one change in attachment styles with age: the oldest adolescents were more dismissive than the younger. Adolescents were more secure with mother than with father, and most dismissive and fearful with father. Boys were more dismissing than girls, who were more fearful with a romantic partner ( n =158). Across time, attachment insecurity with father was associated with insecurity with a best friend. Attachment insecurity with a romantic partner was associated primarily with insecurity with friend, but changes over time tended to be associated with insecurity with mother. Results support the view of a differentiated hierarchy of attachment figures in adolescence, with the quality of parental attachment contributing to close extra‐familial relationships.",

      "title": "When Mothers Leave Their Children Behind",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry has studied the effect on children of separation from their mothers or primary caregivers, but has not given equal attention to the effect on mothers of separation from their children. This article examines the current literature on separation from the mother's perspective. Following a review of the literature on mothers' attachment behaviors, as evidenced by separation from their very young children due to ordinary circumstances, attention will turn to specific populations of mothers enduring separation from their children in situations of hardship: mothers with mental illness, homeless mothers, mothers in prison, and two groups of working mothers—immigrant mothers and deployed navy mothers. Separation can be experienced as temporary, bringing on anxiety, or may involve a mother's choice between her child's safety and her own wish to keep the child near her, causing a conflict in the mother's feelings. In other situations, separation may be involuntary and long-lasting, inducing symptoms of depression, despair, and grief, all of which are characteristic of loss. The particular conditions of the separation—such as choice, control, and ongoing communication between mother and child—can mitigate the impact of the separation and transform it from a total to a partial loss. Three clinical cases of mothers forced to separate from their children in extreme circumstances are examined, with recommendations for treatment.",

      "abstract": "1.1\tLATAR BELAKANG\r\nKetika jaman berubah dengan cepat, salah satu kelompok yang rentan untuk ikut terbawa arus adalah para remaja. Karena mereka memiliki karakteristik tersendiri yang unik: labil, sedang pada taraf mencari identitas, mengalami masa transisi dari remaja menuju status dewasa, dan sebagainya. Secara sosiologis, remaja umumnya memang amat rentan terhadap pengaruh-pengaruh eksternal. Karena proses pencarian jati diri, mereka mudah sekali terombang-ambing, dan masih merasa sulit menentukan tokoh panutannya. Mereka juga mudah terpengaruh oleh gaya hidup masyarakat di sekitarnya. Mereka cenderung mengambil jalan pintas dan tidak mau pusing-pusing memikirkan dampak negatifnya.\r\nMenurut Sosiolog Kartono, kenakalan remaja atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah juvenile delinquency merupakan gejala patologis sosial pada remaja yang disebabkan oleh satu bentuk pengabaian sosial. \r\nKenakalan remaja itu merupakan bagian dari subyek yang belum matang, yang dirusak oleh lingkungan sosialnya, dan yang tidak mampu berperilaku sebagai warga yang bertanggungjawab. Karenanya tidak seharusnya seketika diberi hukuman, tetapi seharusnya diperlakukan untuk peredaan perilaku mereka untuk masa depan dengan gaya hidup non-Kenakalan. Hal ini bisa ditempuh dengan cara rehabilitasi.\r\nKasus kenakalan remaja di Jawa Tengah cukup tinggi. Lebih dari seribu remaja melakukan kenakalan setiap tahun. Walaupun jumlahnya fluktuatif namun jika hal ini dibiarkan tentu seperti memberi kayu pada api, akan semakin membesar. Hal ini pun memiliki dampak yang kompleks dan cukup serius.\r\nOleh karena itu, dibutuhkan suatu tempat untuk merehabilitasi remaja yang melakukan kenakalan di Jawa Tengah dikemas dalam konsep desain yang menarik, yang tidak menekan remaja tersebut dengan perasaan “terpenjara” namun dengan konsep “rekreasi”.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2\tTUJUAN DAN SASARAN\r\nTUJUAN\r\nMemperoleh satu usulan judul Tugas Akhir yang Jelas dan layak, dengan suatu penekanan desain yang spesifik sesuai dengan originalitas / karakter judul dan citra yang dikehendaki atas judul yang diajukan.\r\nSASARAN\r\nSasaran yang ingin dicapai adalah mendapatkan dasar - dasar perencanaan dan perancangan Tempat Rehabilitasi Anak Nakal yang meliputi aspek fungsional, aspek kontekstual, aspek teknis, aspek kinerja dan aspek arsitektural.\r\n\r\n1.3\tMANFAAT\r\nSecara subyektif \r\nadalah guna memenuhi persyaratan Tugas Akhir pada Jurusan Arsitektur Fakultas Teknik Universitas Diponegoro Semarang dan selanjutnya menjadi acuan dalam perancangan grafis Tempat Rehabilitasi Anak Nakal di Kabupaten Semarang.\r\n\r\nSecara obyektif \r\nadalah memberi pengetahuan mengenai masalah - masalah yang berkaitan dengan perencanaan dan perancangan suatu bangunan Tempat Rehabilitasi Anak Nakal serta dapat menjadi acuan bagi pihak - pihak yang membutuhkan dalam proses perencanaan dan perancangan bangunan Tempat Rehabilitasi Anak Nakal yang sesuai dengan standar - standar yang telah ditetapkan tanpa meninggalkan kaidah - kaidah arsitektural . \r\n\r\n1.4\tRUANG LINGKUP PEMBAHASAN\r\nRuang lingkup substansial \r\nPerencanaan dan perancangan Tempat Rehabilitasi Anak Nakal di Kabupaten Semarang, termasuk dalam kategori bangunan bermassa banyak yang berfungsi sebagai fasilitas pendidikan berserta dengan perancangan tapak/lansekapnya.\r\n\r\nRuang lingkup spasial \r\nSecara administratif daerah perencanaan yang terletak di Ungaran, Bagian Perencanaan Wilayah Kabupaten Semarang.\r\n\r\n \r\n1.5\tMETODE PEMBAHASAN\r\nMetode yang dipakai dalam penyusunan penulisan ini antara lain :\r\n1.\tMetode deskriptif, yaitu dengan melakukan pengumpulan data.

      "abstract": "Transformations (from the eighteenth century to the present) of legal and cultural criteria pertaining to child custody are examined, with special reference to issues pertaining to ipso facto preference for the father or the mother as the custodial parent. Starting out with (1) the traditional doctrine which (in theory) gave the father an absolute right to custody in the event of divorce or separation, the essay traces (2) early modifications of that doctrine, with incipient concern for the child's best interests; (3) the “tender-years” doctrine, which favored the mother as the caretaker for very young children; (4) a preference (in an almost 180-degree reversal of the traditional doctrine) for the mother as the custodial parent, except in case of the presence of what were viewed as strongly disqualifying factors; and (5) the egalitarian standard, which rejects ipso facto preference based on the parent's sex. These transformations are discussed in relation to fundamental alterations in perception of sex roles and of children's rights; to changing social and economic realities; to judicial attitudes; and to trends in de facto custody arrangements. Disparities between legal principles and social practices are noted.",

A sample of undergraduates (N = 227) completed the Relationship Distancing Questionnaire and numerous other relationship questionnaires. Results suggested feeling alienation is inversely related to the quality of parent-child relationships during childhood and young adulthood and can be found in intact as well as divorced families.

      "abstract": "Abstract Existing research on phubbing has focused mainly on one relationship group (i.e., partner phubbing). How does phubbing differ across different relationship groups (i.e., family vss people at work)? How does phubbing differ within the same relationship group (i.e., in the case of family relations: parents vs. children)? In which situations (i.e., in bed or at the dinner table) are people more likely to phub others? An online survey of 387 participants, predominantly Australians, revealed that participants were more likely to phub family, friends and strangers than people at work, and they were more likely to phub family and friends than strangers. With regard to family relations, participants were more likely to phub parents, partners and children than grandparents. They were more likely to phub partners and children than parents. The reason certain people are phubbed more frequently than others and in specific situations more than others is due to which social norms matter the most: injunctive norms or smartphone-related internalised norms. Considering that phubbing impacts those with whom the phubber has a closer relationship and those with whom the phubber has a distant relationship, comparing how phubbing differs across different relationship groups contributes to understanding the impact of phubbing on social relationships.",

In the current research, this logic was extended to co-parental behaviors, which refer to how parents coordinate, share responsibility, and support each other’s parental efforts. The effects of early-life unpredictability on individual and dyadic co-parental functioning were examined in a sample of 109 families (two parents and their firstborn child) who were followed longitudinally from before the child’s birth until the age of two. Greater early-life unpredictability (family changes, residential changes, and parents’ occupational changes by age 8) experienced by mothers, but not fathers, predicted more negative co-parental behaviors in triadic observations 6 months post birth, and lower couple-reported co-parenting quality assessed 3, 9, 18, and 24 months post birth. These effects were not explained by parents’ childhood socioeconomic status or current relationship quality. These findings highlight the role of mothers in shaping co-parenting relationships and how these relationships might be influenced by mothers’ early-life experiences.",

In addition, 10 communicative behaviors are identified that can help family members move along the estrangement continuum toward greater distance or maintain their position.

      "title": "La sensibilité sociale d'enfants présentant un trouble du spectre de l'autisme en interaction avec leur grand-parent",
      "abstract": "Le trouble du spectre de l'autisme (TSA) se definit par des difficultes sociocommunicationnelles et par la presence de comportements ou d'interets restreints ou repetitifs (Association americaine de psychiatrie [APA], 2013). Ainsi, les parents doivent s'investir dans la readaptation de leur enfant et reorganiser leur quotidien de maniere a pallier l'alteration fonctionnelle liee au TSA (des Rivieres Pigeon, Courcy, Boucher, Laroche, & Poirier, 2015). Afin de soutenir les parents dans ces nombreuses responsabilites, les grands-parents sont souvent amenes a s'impliquer dans la prise en charge des soins de l'enfant (Rousseau, 2009). Les interactions entre les grands-parents et l'enfant presentant un TSA peuvent toutefois comporter des particularites, en raison meme des deficits sociaux de l'enfant. Par contre, des etudes ont demontre que ces enfants presentent une sensibilite aux stimuli sociaux envers des adultes significatifs, et ce, en depit de l'alteration sociocommunicationnelle observee (Caron, Royer, & Forget, 2014). Ainsi, les enfants ayant un TSA presentent une tendance a varier leur comportement en fonction de l'attention recue des parents, des educateurs et des enseignants (Duval & Forget, 2005; Forget & Rivard, 2010; Poirier & Forget, 1996). Bien que les grands-parents soient identifies comme des personnes significatives, aucune etude ne s'est interessee a la sensibilite sociale des enfants presentant un TSA lorsqu'ils interagissent avec leur grand-parent. Cette etude vise a quantifier la sensibilite sociale d'enfants âges de trois a six ans lorsqu'ils interagissent avec leur grand-parent (n = 6 dyades) dans une situation autonome, pratique et sociale. Les comportements de l'enfant et de son grand-parent sont d'abord observes en milieu naturel a huit reprises a raison de 90 minutes chaque fois. La sensibilite sociale est mesuree par une analyse de regression lineaire simple a l'aide de la loi generalisee de l'appariement et des analyses descriptives sont utilisees pour documenter les comportements observes. Les resultats indiquent que les enfants de cette etude ont une preference pour les comportements sociaux comparativement aux comportements non-sociaux. La preference pour les comportements sociaux correspond a la notion de biais dans le cadre de la loi generalisee de l'appariement. Parmi les comportements recenses, les enfants manifestent le plus souvent des reponses aux demandes des grands-parents et ils cherchent a maintenir l'echange avec eux. Dans une plus faible mesure, ils vont eux-memes initier l'interaction avec le grand-parent. Le taux de comportements sociaux varie selon les conditions; les enfants interagissent ainsi davantage lorsque le contexte est favorable a un echange soit lors d'une condition sociale. Par contre, ils ne modifient pas leurs comportements en fonction de l'attention donnee par leur grand-parent. Il n'y a pas de difference de sensibilite sociale selon les conditions, qu'elles soient autonome, pratique ou sociale. Par ailleurs, les tâches ont ete choisies en fonction de la capacite de l'enfant et non pas pour induire des apprentissages. Il est donc possible que les enfants ne modifient pas leurs comportements en fonction de l'attention du grand-parent lorsqu'il s'agit d'une tâche acquise comme le font les personnes avec un TSA de niveau leger en contexte de classe (Poirier & Forget, 1996). En effet, un enfant qui maitrise une tâche peut la faire de maniere independante, et ce, peu importe les contingences presentes dans l'environnement au meme moment. Cet essai est compose d'une recension des ecrits scientifiques sur les grands-parents d'enfants ayant un TSA et sur la sensibilite sociale des enfants. Ensuite, un article reprend les points centraux de cette recension et presente la methode et les resultats obtenus. L'ensemble des resultats est discute de maniere plus approfondie dans la derniere partie abordant les apports et les limites de cette etude de meme que des recommandations pour de futures recherches.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : autisme, grand-parent, sensibilite sociale, comportements sociaux",

      "title": "Embeddedness and commitment : tracing patterns of family instability and child wellbeing over time.",
      "abstract": "This dissertation includes three quantitative papers using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Paper one, “For us or the children: Exploring the association between coparenting trajectories and parental commitment,” is situated in commitment theory and estimates latent growth curves. Findings suggest that unmarried parents’ coparental relationships are: 1) strong across the first five years of their children’s lives, and 2) influencing parental commitment at year 5. Paper two, “Maternal partnership transitions and coresidence with extended kin,” is situated in life course theory and estimates fixed and random effects models. Findings suggest that unmarried versus married mothers are more likely to coreside with extended kin, especially early in their children’s lives and following a partnership dissolution. By year 9, unmarried mothers are more likely to live “elsewhere” (e.g., temporary shelters). Reliance on extended kin weakens over time, which may be associated with resource depletion or mothers experiencing more stress when living with family. This study found that mothers turn to family members during transitional times. Paper three, “Nest effects: How children fare when changes occur within their mesosystems,” is situated in ecological theory and estimates multilevel models. Findings suggest that extended kin mediate the association between certain types of relationship transitions (e.g., when mothers consistently cohabit) and child wellbeing. Extended kin coresidence increases children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors; however, they also buffer children from instability caused by fathers’ incarceration or mothers’ multipartnered fertility. Kin may offer resources (e.g., attention) to children when their parents are distracted or absent.",

      "abstract": "China, having gone through rapid economic reform, supported by urbanization, educational expansion, and family size reduction over past decades, is an important part of a worldwide sociodemographic trend that can be summarized as a shift from community/ Gemeinschaft to society/ Gesellschaft. Correlated with this sociodemographic trend, our qualitative and quantitative analyses document intergenerational change in grandmothers’ perception of socializing environments and developmental pathways of Chinese children. Grandmothers from Beijing ranked (a) three generations of children at ages 4 to 6 in their families (themselves, their children, and their grandchildren) on autonomy, curiosity, self-expression, obedience, and shyness and (b) three generations of parents in their families (their parents, themselves, and their children) on child-rearing behaviors: support, praise, criticism, and control. As predicted, we found an intergenerational increase in perceived child autonomy, curiosity, and self-expression—individualistic traits adapted to Gesellschaft environments. Also as predicted, perceived child obedience and shyness, adapted to Gemeinschaft environments, declined across the generations. Related changes in reported child-rearing behaviors were also expected and found: Grandmothers judged that parental support and praise (promotion socialization), which foster individuated self-development, increased significantly, although the pattern of parental criticism and control (prevention socialization) was less clear. Promotion-based socialization strategies were found to serve as a partial mediator of intergenerational differences in individualistic child behaviors. Results suggest that the younger generations exhibit more promotion-based socialization, leading to more individualistic child traits, as they adapt to China’s more Gesellschaft ecology, comprising urbanization, formal education, and smaller family size.",

      "title": "Management of personality disorders in pregnancy and the puerperium",
      "abstract": "Women with personality disorders have disturbances in their interpersonal relationships and social functioning which are likely to impact on their care during pregnancy and the puerperium. Their patterns of perception, thought, and response tend to be fixed and inflexible, although their behaviour is often unpredictable, and they find it difficult to respond to the changes and demands of life. Pregnancy, childbirth and becoming a parent are therefore likely to evoke particular difficulties for a woman with a personality disorder. As well as the physical symptoms and discomfort of pregnancy, women have to cope with a shifting range of emotions, from elation to anxiety and ambivalence about the pregnancy, which may at times be heightened by medical concerns about the development of the foetus, and to adjust to their changing body image and the reactions of others. They are often preoccupied by fears and anxieties about the birth itself in the final weeks of pregnancy. In the early days and weeks after delivery, women have to cope not only with the demands of a dependent baby, but also with hormonal fluctuations and tiredness, changes in their role and status, and changes in their social and family relationships. All of these are likely to present considerable challenges to women with personality disorder. Although there are no systematic data on the experience of pregnancy and childbirth in women with personality disorders, and few on parenting, practitioners caring for pregnant and newly delivered women should be aware of the difficulties which potentially face women with personality disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: This article presents an emergent conceptual model of childhood adultification and economic disadvantage derived from 5 longitudinal ethnographies of children and adolescents growing up in low‐income families. Childhood adultification involves contextual, social, and developmental processes in which youth are prematurely, and often inappropriately, exposed to adult knowledge and assume extensive adult roles and responsibilities within their family networks. Exemplar cases from the ethnographies are integrated in the discussion to illustrate components of the model. Four successive levels of adultification are described: precocious knowledge, mentored‐adultification, peerification/spousification, and parentification. The developmental assets and liabilities children incur also are discussed. Recommendations for school, health care, and social service practitioners working with low‐income families and children are provided.",

Ambos enfoques, por otro lado, han convivido con los cuidados y apoyos familiares que se dispensaban (y se dispensan) en el seno familiar. \r\nSin embargo, estas dos concepciones paradigmaticas, mas que realidades disociadas, son dos tipos ideales que, aunque que se contraponen teoricamente, coexisten en la realidad debido a una multiplicidad de condicionantes normativos, sociales, culturales, economicos y politicos. Asi, en la actualidad podemos observar como existen al menos dos variables fundamentales que inciden sobre este fenomeno de la atencion a las situaciones de dependencia, empujandolo hacia dos direcciones opuestas. Por un lado, las disposiciones normativas que bajo ese enfoque comunitario estan orientadas a la permanencia de la persona en situacion de dependencia en su entorno habitual, en la linea de las aspiraciones de los propios afectados y de la opinion publica; por otro lado, los intereses economicos, principalmente de entidades del ambito privado, en amortizar aquellas infraestructuras residenciales que, en un contexto de crisis economica, no han cumplido sus expectativas de cobertura.",

      "abstract": "A couple you have known for years consult with you; they are in despair. Their son’s new psychiatric team has just advised them that, as he is now an adult, he will be able to make his own decisions without his parents attending routine appointments. They have watched their son’s prospects for a normal life disintegrate over the last 2 years — rarely leaving his room, losing his friends, and spending most days without structure or purpose.\n\nMany individuals diagnosed with psychotic conditions live with, or remain in close contact with, informal caregivers, typically close relatives such as their parents, partners, siblings, and children. As in the scenario above, the experience of a family member developing psychosis leaves family members bewildered and frightened, working through high levels of distress and often unsupported or even excluded by healthcare providers. Moreover, this often heralds a long-term commitment by families to support and advocate for an individual while feeling unsupported. As ‘family practitioners’ GPs are in a unique position within the NHS to engage with and support both the individual with psychosis and their family carers.\n\nPsychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, are severe and disabling mental health conditions that affect several million people worldwide and rank among the top global contributors to years lived with disability. The onset typically emerges in adolescence and young adulthood, and often during a period when a young person is establishing their independence. The hallmark symptoms include hallucinations and delusions, often persecutory, that can be focused on other people, including relatives and carers. These will often occur alongside marked disturbances in affect, cognition, and social functioning.\n\nIn the UK, the pooled incidence rates for psychotic disorders are estimated at 32 per 100 000 people with significantly higher rates for black and minority ethnic groups.

A survey of 730 people over 65 shows that cohabitation becomes rarer with advancing age, a phenomenon that has grown increasingly important during the twentieth century. Social isolation, characterized by extremely infrequent contacts with other people, affects approximately one out of ten elderly people. Most at risk are those who retired from lower positions in employment, divorced people and widowers. The main causes are the absence of children and relatives in the immediate area, the fact of being divorced, the lack of professional apprenticeship and, above all, a psychological disposition to introversion. These concepts should form the basis for working out ways of preventing the generalization of a phenomenon which, in the absence of appropriate measures, might become a serious threat to the future of out society.",

      "title": "Kinship Care",
      "abstract": "A relative caregiver (commonly called a kinship caregiver) is rearing about 10 percent of children in the United States. While relative caregivers are typically a child’s grandparent, they can also be other relatives (e.g., aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins) or fictive kin (e.g., godparents). The most prevalent care arrangement is classified as informal, denoting an agreement voluntarily brokered between a child’s parent and relative caregivers. However, more commonly discussed in the literature is formal care, where a public child welfare entity has intervened in establishing safeguards for a child, resulting in court action that designates a child a ward of the state and authorizes placement with a relative caregiver. This dichotomous classification involves more nuanced typologies when considering the voluntary versus involuntary nature of agreements and the public versus private auspices under which they fall. For example, a child could be in an informal, private kinship care arrangement brokered by a public child welfare entity. Such distinctions are important not just for classification but because they are often associated with differential levels of support, financial provisions, public oversight, and outcomes (e.g., child well-being, permanency). While typologies vary, there are common reasons why children come to be reared by relatives, including child maltreatment, parental incarceration, physical or mental illness, addiction, death, or abandonment. For children removed from parental care for maltreatment, placement with kin tends to be preferred for most public child welfare agencies. Demographically, Black and Native children are most likely to be reared by kin. Caregivers tend to be women, unmarried, of color, and economically disadvantaged, with an average age of fifty. Kinship caregiver experiences differ, but most report satisfaction with the role and a sense of self-efficacy from ensuring that their relative’s child is safe, nurtured, feels loved, and remains connected to family. Although kinship care is considered a protective factor because children experience more favorable outcomes (e.g., stability) than their counterparts do, many caregivers report being under resourced and experiencing high stress levels. Likewise, many kinship caregivers lack knowledge and direction about legal issues, resources, and pathways to support. Safeguarding children and promoting their well-being is of paramount interest to those involved in kinship care. More recent research and state and federal laws recognize that to advance child well-being, financial provisions, services, and supports must be in place for children and caregivers. Despite significant gains in the past twenty years, the literature, well-supported programs and interventions, and policy related to kinship care remains inchoate.",

FANS), this paper examines the association between the presence of co-resident extended kin and children’s internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The paper demonstrates the differential role of extended kin by family structure, as well as across parental immigrant status – specifically, nativity and documentation status. Children in the sample were found to be disadvantaged in extended family households, especially with regard to internalizing behaviors. This disadvantageous association was found mostly among married-parent extended family households, whereas there was no association between the presence of extended kin and behavior problems in children from single-parent families. This pattern emerged more clearly among children of documented immigrants, compared to those with native-born parents and those whose parents were unauthorized immigrants. These findings suggest a need to modify previous theories on extended family living arrangements; they also provide policy implications for immigrant families.",

      "abstract": "We address three long-standing fundamental questions about early human development and parental caregiving within a specificity framework using data from 796 infant-mother dyads from 11 societies worldwide. Adopting a cross-society view opens a vista on universal biological origins of, and contextual influences on, infant behaviors and parenting practices. We asked: how do infant behaviors and parenting practices vary across societies? How do infant behaviors relate to other infant behaviors, and how do parent practices relate to other parent practices? Are infant behaviors and parent practices related to one another? Behaviors of firstborn five-month infants and parenting practices of their mothers were microanalyzed from videorecords of extensive naturally occurring interactions in the home. In accord with behavioral specificity, biological expectations and cultural influences, we find that infants and mothers from diverse societies exhibit mean-level society differences in their behaviors and practices; domains of infant behaviors generally do not cohere, nor do domains of maternal practices, and only specific infant behaviors and mother practices correspond. Few relations were moderated by society.",

      "title": "Grandmothers raising their transgender grandchildren: An exploratory study",
      "abstract": "This exploratory study builds upon previous research relating to grandparents of transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth by investigating the experiences of 2 affirming grandmothers raising their transgender granddaughters (age 6 years at T1). Participants reported experiences similar to those reported by affirming parents of TGD children, such as facing resistance from their communities when affirming the children's gender identities. Similar to previous research on grandfamilies in general, describing a warm bond between grandparents and grandchildren, our participants described a special relationship with their TGD grandchildren that led to the grandmothers being the children's 1st and strongest allies. Participants faced challenges and advantages distinct from those experienced by affirming parents of TGD children and, in some cases, by grandparents raising non-TGD grandchildren. These challenges pertained to: (a) their unexpected/unplanned primary caregiver role, (b) navigating the legal system, (c) the impact of the familial situation on the child, and (d) negotiating the parents' involvement in the children's lives. Two types of advantages—internal (e.g., experience, confidence, maturity) and external (e.g., community connections, credibility, respect)—were identified. Findings have implications for policy, practice, and future research, providing insight into some of the potentially unique stresses and strengths of grandfamilies with TGD grandchildren.",

Factors affecting complaints in 345 family house-holds are contrasted with factors leading to complaints in a subsample of 622 other residential alternatives. Behavioral problems are the best predictors of complaints from all households regardless of type, but some causal factors identified are unique to family residences, notably failure to perform household chores and infrequently socializing with friends. Active and passive rule violations, encompassing both do's and don'ts, are more important than clinical history and social background in understanding complaints.",

      "abstract": "The death of the spouse caused the family to become disjointed, and as a result, the wife was responsible for the upbringing of their children on her own. In the most recent decades, there has been a considerable rise in the number of cases involving divorce, which is the formal dissolution of a marriage, as well as other marital concerns. A large amount of influence is exerted on the raising of their children, if and when applicable. When it comes to providing their children with moral support and direction in terms of discipline, it may appear that single mothers have a heavier load to carry. Both couples are impacted by the separation, but the woman is more likely to experience the emotional agony and dissatisfaction. She faces a number of obstacles, such as the disapproval of society and the stigma associated with being a \"single mother,\" as she strives to achieve independence for both herself and her kid. The social milieu that a single mother encounters in rural locations is very different from the one that she encounters in metropolitan settings. There is a significant impact on the status of single mothers brought about by the prevalent societal customs and ambitions around the establishment of families. It is the purpose of this study to investigate and compare the social and economic circumstances of single mothers living in urban and rural areas simultaneously.",

      "title": "THE PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS IN MIDLIFE AND LATE ADULTHOOD",
      "abstract": "In contrasts to other types of family caregiving, providing care for a son/daughter with a developmental disability (DD) often is lifelong and persists into late adulthood. The caregiving responsibilities become more difficult to manage as these caregivers begin to experience the health and cognitive changes associated with aging. Despite the increasing life expectancy of individuals with DD and their reliance on family members for care in adulthood, the family caregiving literature has paid less attention to the psychosocial well-being of this group of caregivers in the context of other family caregivers. Utilizing data from National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS-II), this study examines the effects of caregiver types (caregivers of sons/daughters with DD, parent, spousal/partner, and parent-in-law) on psychosocial well-being (e.g., Ryff’s psychological well-being, positive/negative affect, subjective aging, generativity). A sample of 405 midlife and older adults (M=56.01, SD=11.26) who provided care to a family member completed a set of interview and questionnaires. Regression analyses showed that caregivers of sons/daughters with DD exhibited the lowest levels of environmental mastery and perception of generativity, highest level of negative affect, and older subjective age as compared to other family caregivers. Of all the family caregivers, parent-in-law caregivers exhibited the most positive psychosocial well-being. Additionally, gender moderated the associations between caregiver types and psychosocial well-being. Study findings can help inform outreach programs and services aimed at family caregivers by highlighting the nuances in needs across different types of family caregivers in midlife and late adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Many fathers—married, never married, or divorced—are absent or remote from their child’s life during the early years. As circumstances change, he may become eager to get to know the child, especially as milestones come and go, or wish to parent after returning from an absence. Mothers are frequently less sanguine about such returns to the child’s life for myriad reasons. This chapter discusses the deleterious effects of father absence on child development, interventions currently in use to reintegrate the positively engaged father back into the family, examining and softening maternal gatekeeping, and the theoretical and evidence bases for such interventions. A case example will be used to demonstrate how the intervention work can be approached to maximize the child’s opportunity to have a positive relationship with his or her father while maintaining equilibrium in the mother–child dyad.",

This chapter focuses on severe mental illness. Generally, research indicates that being female, unmarried or from a disadvantaged social class increases risk for experiencing mental health problems and that these patterns persist into later life. Research has emphasized the importance of social support: emotional support appears stable across old age but networks may be depleted as friends die. For most older people who have a mental health disorder, it is a recurrence or continuation of a condition that first occurred much earlier in life. Social factors are important in understanding responses to symptoms of mental illness, treatment patterns and outcomes. Social policies influence the setting where elderly people receive care with current efforts focused on the integration of mental health services with primary medical care.",

This is one of the statements made in the study focused on the experiences of family members of people with (profound) intellectual (and multiple) disabilities (both of individuals living in a residential facility as persons living at home). In recent years, there has been greater recognition of the important position of parents and siblings of people with (profound) intellectual (and multiple) disabilities and the importance of the wellbeing of all family members, but there is still a lack of knowledge concerning this topic. The experiences of siblings, for example, are often neglected, but are analyzed in this study. Although the experiences of siblings of children with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities are predominantly positive, they also experience difficulties growing up with a sibling with a disability. Some siblings for example experienced problems in dealing with the behaviour of their brother or sister. Next to this, the study showed that parents of children with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, in spite of the professional support for their child, spent a much higher proportion of their time on care and supervision of their children than parents of children without disabilities. Parents indicate that this disrupts their daily habits. The majority of families also indicated negative consequences on their social life and financial situation of having a child with such profound disabilities. Despite the strong negative impact on family life, the majority of parents also experience a positive impact on their families. Finally, the results showed that the majority of parents (or other relatives) are satisfied with the quality of support provided in a residential facility. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of parents was dissatisfied, or only marginally satisfied with the quality of support. This study shows how important it is to also pay attention to the situation and needs of the family members of people with (profound) intellectual (and multiple) disabilities and to offer support tailored to the needs of all family members in order to achieve optimal quality of life of all family members.",

An interaction effect was also found: Boys in single-mother families report more acceptance and fewer conflicts than boys in stepfather families. Multiple regression analysis revealed that mother–ex-partner relationships are associated with children's problem behavior, whereas child–nonresidential father relationships are associated with positive aspects of children's well-being. The results indicate that family structure itself is not associated with child adjustment. What matters most is the quality of family relationships.",

      "abstract": "The Role of Non-Parental Youth-Adult Relationships in Early and Late Adolescence Supportive relationships can facilitate youth's positive development across adolescence.Aside from supportive parent and peer relationships, many young people indicate the presence of significant non-parental adults (e.g., teachers, coaches, extended family members, etc.) in their lives (also known as \"VIPs\" or natural mentors; Beam et al., 2002;Dubois & Silverthorn, 2005).Through the provision of different types of social support, these relationships facilitate positive gains in the health and wellbeing of youth (Sterrett et al., 2011).However, despite the potential benefits of these relationships, there has been little consideration of how the relational process may vary across different adolescent stages and types of social support. Types of Support from Significant Non-Parental AdultsSignificant non-parental adults (VIPs) provide youth with multiple types of social support including informational, instrumental, emotional, validation and companionship support (Wills & Shinar, 2000).These supports are associated with increases in youth's academic functioning and self-esteem as well as decreases in youth's behavioral and emotional difficulties (see Sterrett et al., 2011 for a review).The existence of multiple types of social support has posed challenges to establishing clear links between social support and adolescent wellbeing (Chu et al., 2010).While much of the literature has focused on establishing links between different types of social support from parents and peers, less attention has been given to non-parental adults.The research in this area is limited given evidence that suggests VIPs provide youth with varying types of support, which can differentially influence relational processes and youth outcomes (Sterrett et al., 2011).More empirical work is needed to understand the characteristics and nature of supportive non-parental youth-adult relationships during adolescence, as well as what types and aspects of support in these relationships may be most salient for youth at different developmental stages (Spencer, 2007). Developmental Stages and Changes in Early and Late AdolescenceAdolescence is generally divided into three sub-stages-early (ages 10-14), middle (ages 15-17), and late adolescence (ages 18-21; Steinberg, 2016), which coincide with the educational transitions of middle school and high school to a period of emerging adulthood (Arnett, 2004).With each of these transitions, youth's social worlds expand as they move into a new social context (e.g., educational, out-of-school, and workplace settings).Notably, as they grow older, youth's relationships with VIPs may take on new roles, functions, and meanings (Spencer, 2007).Unfortunately, much of the literature on these relationships focuses on adolescence as a whole rather than as separate developmental stages.This lack of differentiation is problematic given literature suggesting great variability in the characteristics, needs, and perceptions of youth during different adolescent stages (Steinberg, 2016).For example, during early adolescence, the goals for learning emphasized through policies and practices become more tightly controlled and scheduled, limiting student access to and time with caring adults, opportunities for competence-building, and healthy individuation (Pianta et al., 2012).Researchers have documented a number of challenges that youth report facing during this period, including perceiving less adult caring and support, and limitations in school organization, classroom autonomy, and instructional quality (Klem & Connell, 2004).Consequently, indicators of student engagement (e.g., motivation, grades, and attendance) and socioemotional wellbeing (e.g., self-esteem, mental health) have been found to decline as students transition to upper grade levels (Benner, 2011).These changes are highly relevant to thinking about how youth's relationships with VIPs during early adolescence may best fit the",

      "abstract": "El presente ensayo se centró en una revisión bibliográfica sobre la conducta agresiva infantil. Se utilizó un enfoque basado en la estabilidad relativa en el transcurso del tiempo y su conexión consistente a una variedad de resultados negativos, incluyendo la delincuencia, el uso de drogas o sustancias químicas, problemas de conducta, poca adaptación y dificultades académicas (como notas bajas, suspensión, expulsión y abandono de la escuela). Una de las característica de la familia nicaragüense es el ser extensa. Es muy raro encontrar un hogar compuesto solamente por la pareja y los hijos o por la mujer sola con sus hijos. La presencia de abuelos, tíos u otros parientes es bastante común. Los factores económicos determinan en buena medida esta realidad. La escasez de vivienda y la gran cantidad de mujeres que tienen que sostener el hogar o reforzar su economía- requieren la presencia de otros adultos en el hogar, que se transforma así en un pequeño y eficaz núcleo de organización, en donde todos los miembros son interdependientes y en donde las responsabilidades están repartidas en función de las posibilidades de cada uno y de la común supervivencia de todos. Las dificultades familiares como: discordia entre pareja, poco control de impulsos de los padres, alcoholismo, hijos no deseados, trastornos nerviosos entre otros contribuyen a la agresión infantil. El medio familiar es el lugar de génesis y desarrollo de la personalidad de niños específicamente influida por la imitación del comportamiento del padre, madre y demás personas del contexto familiar y social.",

People retain less and less the traditional structure of life, social bonds, the natural and environmental living conditions and vital activity. The abrupt change in customary living conditions, caused by the removal of family to another country or region, where there are different cultural traditions and language, leads to the disorientation of a child-preschooler from a migrant family. The contemporary state of the problem of the social adaptation of children from migrant families allows to reveal insufficient readiness of pedagogues for the establishment of conditions, which should ensure the adaptation of children to a new social milieu through interaction with their parents.",

El aumento en la edad media de los familiares y el acusado descenso de personas disponibles en los hogares para hacerse cargo de los enfermos, permiten prever dificultades crecientes en la satisfacción de la necesidad de cuidados por enfermedad, en el modo que tradicionalmente se ha venido haciendo en el interior de los hogares, especialmente las crónicas y de larga duración. El dato más positivo de estos cambios, por lo que a la enfermedad y discapacidad se refiere, es la existencia de varios millones de varones jubilados en buenas condiciones de salud, que aunque carecen del hábito y la tradición de encargarse del cuidado de enfermos, constituyen al menos potencialmente una gran reserva para el cuidado de sus familiares o de otros enfermos a través de organizaciones de voluntariado. No obstante, para que esta posibilidad se lleve a la práctica es necesario un fuerte cambio de valores y actitudes que por ahora apenas se ha iniciado en la sociedad española.",

For example, what is the association between attachment behaviors and working models of attachment relationships and adults' abilities to comfort themselves or to be attachment figures? Many adults show attachment behaviors toward parents, siblings, and close friends. Must attachment behavior always transfer to an adult love partner? What is the role of culture? Does adult-adult attachment behavior have an ethological or adaptive role in childrearing?",

When the respondent and the other person were bereaved by the same loss, support relationships were more likely to be difficult. The difficulty arose in part from problems in making shared decisions, in meeting one another's needs and standards, and in coming to shared realities. In some cases the difficulty could be attributed, in part, to the history of the relationship between the people sharing bereavement or to the emotional, cognitive, and physical demands of bereavement. In potential support situations where interviewees were not also mourners, those who held back generally had not experienced a death of somebody close.",

Yet there is little information about the impact of family climate on adolescents’ social adaptation, and the term “family climate” is seldom clearly defined and is usually related to other concepts, such as family systems or family environments. To understand the core of family climate, this study conducted a systematic review to analyze research about family climate associated with adolescents’ social adaptation in community samples. A search of empirical research published over the last 20 years identified 12 relevant studies. The studies revealed that family climate can mainly be described in terms of cohesion, conflict, organization, adaptability, and expressiveness. Family climate was shown to be a good predictor of both problem-solving skills and violence in relationships and exhibited further associations with other aspects of social adaptation. This review revealed a need for more systematic and longitudinal research on family climate in community samples.",

Despite the large scale of the problem, it occurs largely invisibly. However, it has many negative consequences for physical and psychological health, the surroundings (including family, friends, work) and society. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the origin and continuation of substance use disorders. In many cases, these disorders affect oral health, personal care and treatability. Oral healthcare professionals can play an important role in identifying substance use disorders, in encouraging those with problematic substance use to seek professional help and as an essential step in treatment and recovery.Wanneer verslavende middelen overmatig gebruikt worden en de betreffende persoon het middel blijft gebruiken ondanks dat dit problemen oplevert, is er sprake van een middelgerelateerde stoornis. Ondanks de grote omvang voltrekt deze problematiek zich grotendeels onzichtbaar. Het heeft echter vele negatieve gevolgen op de fysieke en psychische gezondheid, de omgeving (waaronder familie, vrienden, werk) en de samenleving. Bij het ontstaan en voortbestaan van middelgerelateerde stoornissen spelen genetische en omgevingsfactoren een rol. Deze stoornissen hebben in veel gevallen gevolgen voor de mondgezondheid, de zelfzorg en behandelbaarheid. Mondzorgverleners kunnen een belangrijke rol spelen bij het signaleren van deze problematiek, stimuleren tot het zoeken van professionele hulp en een essentiële stap zijn in de behandeling en het herstel.",

Greenfield's Theory of Social Change, Cultural Evolution, and Human Development predicts that when survival concerns augment, and one's social world narrows toward the family household. life shifts towards activities, values, relationships, and parenting expectations typical of small-scale rural subsistence environments with low life expectancy. Specific predictions were that, during the pandemic, respondents would report intensified survival concerns (e.g., thinking about one's own mortality); increased subsistence activities (e.g., growing food); augmented subsistence values (e.g., conserving resources); more interdependent family relationships (e.g., members helping each other obtain food); and parents expecting children to contribute more to family maintenance (e.g., by cooking for the family). All hypotheses were confirmed with a large-scale survey in California (N = 1,137) administered after about a month of stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic; results replicated in Rhode Island (N = 955). We posited that an experience of increased survival concerns and number of days spent observing stay-at-home orders would predict these shifts. A structural equation model confirmed this hypothesis.",

The patterns were stronger for two-parent than single-parent families.

      "abstract": "This chapter presents a concise description of the relational system of the elderly after retirement. The association between age of retirement and frailty can be different in comparison with health. Frailty in older adults is a very common condition and associated with adverse (health) outcomes, like hospitalization, institutionalization and death. The method used in this study is the interview-based survey and the results are obtained after interviewing twenty people. They are between 65 and 80 years old and some of them live in rural areas and others live in urban areas. The interviewees underlined the value of maintaining relationships with family, friends, and the community after retirement. The elderly look after their grandchildren and help around the house. They also receive assistance from family, friends, neighbors, and the community when they are in need (whether they are ill, unable to move, or alone). The elderly wellbeing is largely generated by the social network through communication, through exchanging experience or \"reviving memories\".Among the activities facilitating the development and consolidation of the relational system, the following stand out: agricultural work, household activities, caring for grandchildren, involvement in community life. All of the testimonies underscore the essential needs of the elderly, including opportunities to express opinions, ideas, and feelings, community connections, safety and security, and a sense of purpose. These findings can serve as an excellent springboard for building and creating appropriate local laws as well as for the local development of the social network.",

      "abstract": "The increase in life expectancy, decline in fertility have increased the proportion of elderly (aged 65 nad over) and old (above 80 years) almost in all populations accros the world. In this contekst family relations among generations are of atmost importance in the society. Although diverse in structure and functions - concerning closeness, flexibility and communication family represents latent that can be activated to provide support and well-being for all family members. Longevity of parents, grandparents and great grandparents can have potentially negative consequence. Longer years of shared lives involve protracted years of caregiving of dependet elders and can involve protracted conflicts leading to abuse. Presented research of well-being of elderly indicate intergenerational relations in family. Unbalanced, inflexible comunications can lead to ambivalence, conflicts, neglect or abuse.

      "abstract": "Self-continuity is a central process of identity that connects one’s past and present. Research is limited regarding the life-course determinants of self-continuity and its development in later life. We used multilevel hierarchical models to investigate how the occurrence of life-course adversity (e.g., childhood adversity or partner loss) and the accumulation of resources shapes the perception of self-continuity in mid and later life, with respect to both their levels and changes over time. A three-wave longitudinal data set was used. The sample consisted of divorcees (n = 396), widows and widowers (n = 319), and married individuals (control; n = 513) in the second half of life. The divorcees had the lowest levels of self-continuity compared to the married and widowed individuals. Self-continuity increased with age for all marital status groups but followed differential trajectories. The divorcees were the most vulnerable group regarding their level and development of self-continuity. More childhood adversity was associated with less self-continuity for all groups, showing the influence of distal adversity on later life identity processes. Our findings illustrate that self-continuity changes as a function of age but differs based on the adverse events experienced across the life course.",

      "abstract": "Resumen.\nEl incremento de la esperanza de vida, esta? dando como resultado un excesivo envejecimiento de la poblacio?n mundial. Consecuencia de este feno?meno, las afecciones y patologi?as propias de la tercera edad son cada vez ma?s frecuentes. Dentro de las enfermedades propias de la poblacio?n mayor de 65 an?os, destaca la demencia. La demencia supone un problema prioritario para nuestro sistema de sociedad actual. Tradicionalmente el cuidado de un familiar enfermo se ha venido desarrollando dentro del nu?cleo familiar. Ciertos cambios sociales, econo?micos y sanitarios han propiciado que el modelo de cuidado familiar se vea en declive y exista una escasez de cuidadores, asi? como un mayor riesgo de institucionalizacio?n del enfermo. En la mayori?a de los casos el cuidador principal es una mujer (co?nyuge o hija del enfermo), con una edad entorno a los 55-60 an?os, sin ocupacio?n laboral. \nConsecuencia de la problema?tica asociada a la enfermedad (dependencia, problemas conductuales y deterioro cognitivo), de la dificultad y exigencia que implica cuidar a un enfermo con estas caracteri?sticas y de la falta de recursos disponibles (apoyo, informacio?n, centros asistenciales) es altamente probable que el cuidador pueda manifestar claros si?ntomas de agotamiento fi?sico y emocional, que de no ser atendidos a tiempo, pueden derivar en consecuencias mayores para su salud. Igualmente, un cuidador sobrecargado puede suponer un detrimento en la calidad de los cuidados, asi? como un mayor riesgo para la pronta institucionalizacio?n del paciente. \nExiste una gran variedad de intervenciones psicosociales dirigidas a reducir el malestar experimentado por el cuidador, pudiendo variar en cuanto a contenidos y formatos de aplicacion. Se han publicado multitud de estudios que valoran la eficacia de las intervenciones psicosociales. En general, las intervenciones se muestran eficaces a la hora de disminuir el malestar del cuidador. Los trabajos de revision y metaanalisis publicados hasta el momento se han desarrollado bajo una perspectiva poco exhaustiva y mediante metodologias no siempre acertadas (seleccion de estudios, metodos de analisis,?,etc.). \nPor ello con el presente trabajo, se ha pretendido hacer una revision de la evidencia disponible desde una perspectiva mas precisa (con criterios de seleccion bien definidos y rigurosos) y un posterior analisis mediante tecnicas de metaanalisis basadas en el modelo de efectos aleatorios. Dentro del metaanalisis, se han realizado analisis de sensibilidad, calculo de heterogenidad, metaregresion, medicion del riesgo de sesgos de publicacion, ajuste del tamano del efecto ante la presencia de riesgo de sesgo de publicacion).\nLos resultados encontrados indican que las intervenciones psicoeducativas pueden producir leves cambios beneficiosos y significativos, en el estado de sobrecarga, depresio?n y mejora de calidad de vida de los cuidadores informales de pacientes con demencia a los 6 meses. Variables como el estre?s, la salud mental o la adherencia al tratamiento no experimentan cambios significativos con respecto a los grupos controles. \nEl escaso nu?mero de estudios disponibles con medidas de seguimiento, como la alta heterogeneidad encontrada son factores que deben ser tenidos en cuenta antes de interpretar estos resultados. \nEn aquellas variables en los que el nu?mero de estudios ha posibilitado ana?lisis ma?s exhaustivos se ha detectado posibles sesgos de publicacio?n que controlados mediante diferentes te?cnicas, han arrojado taman?os del efecto ma?s discretos. \nEn base a estos resultados, el autor realiza 6 breves conclusiones y recomienda, en la medida de lo posible, el uso de metodologi?as adecuadas, basadas en consensos y esta?ndares cienti?ficos (gui?a Consort, Prism, ...etc.) que permitan superar las limitaciones descritas anteriormente y que faciliten la comprensio?n y si?ntesis de los resultados obtenidos.",

      "abstract": "This article focuses on the stressors of parenting an adult child who experiences homelessness. Parents whose adult children become homeless may provide support to this child, but they may also subsequently experience stress and require social support themselves. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that parents who spend more time or money helping their homeless adult offspring experience higher levels of stress. Results also show higher levels of stress among parents who helped with activities of daily living and among parents who worked to prevent harm involving their adult homeless offspring. Among 37 respondents, a majority of whom were African American mothers parenting homeless sons, parents who engaged in activities to prevent harm and parents who experienced stress from harm prevention received more extensive social support. Health and social service providers should recognize and respond to the financial, emotional, and temporal burdens of parenting an adult who becomes homeless. Service providers can both support people who become homeless and reinforce larger family systems, particularly in circumstances that involve more extensive parental support or more harmful situations.",

In comparison to their peers, young people leaving care are at risk of experiencing negative life outcomes, including poor physical health, homelessness, unemployment, early pregnancy and criminality (Cashmore and Paxman, 2006; Green and Jones, 2002; Mendes, 2007). Against this backdrop, therapeutic residential care, while an emerging model of care, is increasingly finding favour as an intervention for children and young people with complex trauma and attachment-related needs (McLean, Price-Robertson & Robinson, 2011).",

      "abstract": "While adolescence is often described as a mourning process, the author insists that it is not so and should not be considered as such since the adolescent in the normal process of development is confronted with gains and losses, but necessary ones in that instance. On the other hand, the actual loss of a parent, a sibling or a friend of the same age is always difficult as the combined effects of bereavement may interfere and at times complicate the critical passage of adolescence. Reactions may also vary with the lost figure. The death of a friend or peer is a very special experience, the adolescent being reminded that it could have happened to him or herself. Considering the loss of parents, the disappearance of the mother is crucial in the young age (between 2 and 4 yrs-old) and also in monoparental families, but the death of the father is considered by the author as particularly difficult in adolescence, especially when the father was absent or a badly failing figure. In all cases, the quality of the relation preexisting to the loss is central in the evolution and issue of the grieving process. As to the type of support most fitted with bereaved adolescents, the author favours self help groups and workshops where adolescents can talk freely but with a special focus on concrete activities. Still recent these initiatives should be developed in the coming years.",

Adolescent is a person that no longer seen as a child, but can not be said as an adult as well. In this condition, sometimes they make troubles or problems. Then, there is an assumption that adolescents are a strange group because they have values ​​that are different from their parents or people who are more mature than them. So, it is very important to understand the moral reasoning by all children in preventing adolescent delinquency. Moral reasoning is how a person can make a decision whether what he does is something good or bad; the reason for them to think that whatever they do is considered good or bad. Moral reasoning develops in the order of stages. Therefore, children always need guidance from parents or teachers so they can always move carefully according to the level of reasoning.",

      "title": "From person-centered care to relational centered care",
      "abstract": "Relational-focused, or family-centered care, relies on recognizing interactions between persons with dementia and their family and caregivers. These interactions hold the key to giving better care and developing improved practice and policy.Over several decades, the expectations of the roles of spouses, partners, family, and friends in the care of people with dementia have shifted. Researchers and clinicians have progressed from a focus on the biomedical symptoms to one that incorporates the psycho-social determinants of health. Consequently, more attention has been given to the influence that social relationships have on the well-being of people with dementia.A systemic view of the social network, parti- cularly of family, recognizes that the experience of dementia impacts the whole family. Person- centered care approaches support an asymme- trical model of care, despite the social context. Nolan et al. (2002) express the limitations of person-centered care by stating that person- centered care may well have transformed thinking ... and practice in dementia, but it does not fully capture the dynamics of relationships.The dynamic and relational view of the individual's life needs to be considered in order to understand the whole experience of demen- tia. Relational-focused, or family-centered care, relies on recognition of the interaction of the participants, those with dementia, and those without. Discovery of these interactions is im- portant in supporting the person with dementia, and is another step in the development of practice and policy (Woods, 2001).Caregiver-Centered CareIn the early 1980s, in response to a reawakening of scientific interest in dementia and increased public awareness of Alzheimer's Disease (pri- marily due to the formation of the Alzheimer's Association), the focus of concern was on the caregiver. It was assumed that the well-being of caregivers was compromised by the stress and burden of their relentless work. The construct of caregiver burden described the increased health risks, emotional disturbance, and finan- cial strain on caregivers (George and Gwyther, 1986; Lazarus and Folkman, 1984; Pearlin et al., 1990). Specifically, spousal relationships and co-residence were associated with poor care- giving outcomes (Pruchno and Potashnik, 1989; Hughes et al., 1999).While caregiving for a person with dementia came to be viewed as a negative experience, research studies identified components that contribute to or buffer caregiver stress, such as the caregiver's gender and coping style, demen- tia severity and behavior issues, duration of caregiving, quality of the caregiver--care receiver relationship, and family and social networks (Archbold et al., 1990; Connell, Janevic, and Gallant, 2001; Ford et al., 1997; Teri, 1997; Whitlatch, Feinberg, and Stevens, 1999; Lawrence, Tennstedt, and Assmann, 1998).A parallel literature emerged, demonstrat- ing that caregiving can have positive outcomes, such as feelings of gain or gratification, and that some caregivers actually experience satisfaction (Andren and Elmstahl, 2005; Kramer, 1997). Studies have drawn attention to the linkage between perceived relationship continuity and caregivers' sense of gratification, frustration, and rewards in the caregiving role (Morgan and Laing, 1991; Motenko, 1989). Similarly, additional research has uncovered dynamics of meaning- making within the processes and experiences of caregiving, exposing the range of caregiving experiences (Farran et al., 1991; Paun, 2004; Quayhagen and Quayhagen, 1996).Personhood and the Emergence of Person-Centered CareIn the 1980s and 1990s, people with dementia were primarily seen as empty shells, passive victims, sufferers, and those who had experi- enced a loss of self. The prevailing dominant approach was biomedical, and those with dementia were seen as having little agency, control, awareness, or insight. Reactions to this reductionist view stimulated a movement that recognized the person beyond the symptoms and neuropathology and claimed, There is still a person in there (Castleman, Gallagher- Thompson, and Naythons, 1999). …",

(b) Extended family: kecenderungan adanya perbedaan pola asuh orangtua dengan anggota keluarga lain. (c) Diverse family: kecenderungan orangtua memenuhi kebutuhan anak dengan bekerja sehari penuh, sehingga kurang waktu bersama anak. Kendala yang dihadapi orangtua di antaranya, orangtua yang bekerja dan mendelegasikan pengasuhan kepada kakek atau nenek, saudara yang lain, maupun kepada pengasuh. Strategi yang dilakukan orangtua adalah dengan melakukan pengaturan waktu dan melakukan pembatasan pergaulan anak dengan lingkungan, apabila dirasakan lingkungan tidak memberikan kontribusi positif terhadap perkembangan sosial anak.",

      "abstract": "For most young people, emerging adulthood (ages 18–29) becomes the first time in their lives when they are given almost complete autonomy on how to spend their time. As such, they can choose how much of that time to spend with others and how much of it to spend in solitude. Those choices may be influenced by internal motivations to approach or avoid social interaction, and, in turn, may be related to outcomes experienced during the twenties. Thus, the purpose of this chapter is to provide: (1) a conceptual framework for the areas in which emerging adulthood may be unique in the life span for various elements of solitude (i.e., social withdrawal): (2) a review of literature for what is known about solitude, particularly social withdrawal, in emerging adulthood; and (3) direction for future work that would enhance our understanding of the impact of solitude in the lives of emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates how the receipt of formal, informal, and/or a combination of both types of care at home relates to older adults’ perceived loneliness, life satisfaction, and day-to-day lives. Quantitative analyses using the Canadian Community Health Survey ( n = 3,928) reveal that older adults who only received formal care reported lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of life satisfaction when compared with respondents who received informal or a blend of home care. Qualitative analyses of persons aged 65+ years receiving formal and informal home care in Ontario ( n = 34) suggest that formal care bolstered care recipients’ autonomy and reduced their sense of being a burden on family. In turn, receiving formal care served to improve these older adults’ social connectedness and well-being. Findings underscore older adults’ symbolic, functional, and emotional attachment to formal care services, as well as the limitations of a reliance on informal support.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60–80 percent of cases. The disease causes devastating impairment and often loss of cognitive and relational functioning for the individual and creates disorder and chaos for the family system. Even when not stepping into the formal role of caretaker, children of parents with Alzheimer’s disease experience increased vulnerability to physical and psychological illness, changes in family roles, and uncertainty about navigating a relationship with a parent they no longer know. In the present study, I sought to understand, through the lens of identity and identity-work, how adult children of parents with the disease perceived that their communication with and about the parent changed. Data from interviews with 12 adult children, none of whom were formal caregivers to their parents with the illness but all reported experiencing shifts in their identity and roles as a child of a parent with the disease, revealed four significant communication changes: communicating with a parent who was the same but different, communicating in multiple roles, correcting or reprimanding the parent, and managing parent’s private information. I discuss these findings, their implications, practical suggestions from the data, and suggested areas of future research.",

In times of life crisis, parents may become temporarily unable to find the resources within themselves to actively manage their relationships with their children, but this situation is generally time limited. The capacity for parents to care deeply for each child and to find different but balanced ways of involvement with each of their children is the norm. That is, unless a child in the family dies. In that situation, the capacity for parents to undergo a normal mourning process in which they will grieve for the deceased child and emerge able to continue meaningful and balanced interaction with the surviving children is far from assured. In all too many cases, the parents maintain a continuing preoccupation with and heightened investment in the relationship to the lost one and the loss itself.",

Changes identified concern increases in the number and percentage of children who live in poverty, maternal employment in two-parent families, single-parent families, and the number of children in nonparental child care. Characteristics of poverty for children involve duration, race, one-parent families, and rural populations. Low income is associated with many negative outcomes for children, and income loss is an important contributor to problems experienced by mother-only families. The effects of these family variables are mediated and moderated by a range of child, family and environmental characteristics. Boys appear to be more vulnerable than is to stressful events in the -amily. The age of the child is an important determinant of effects. ..)upport systems in the extended family and community consistently emerge as important moderatc.,;.-: of the negative effects of divorce, maternal employment, and nonparental care.

We conducted a grounded theory study of how 33 emerging adults maintained or changed their relationships with their nonresidential fathers during the transition to adulthood. In‐depth interviews revealed that some father–child relationships were unchanged by divorce, but most became more distant immediately following parental separation. During emerging adulthood these relationships did not necessarily become closer, but communication often increased and stressful interactions decreased for some, especially when compared to childhood. The findings suggest that normative changes that accompany emerging adulthood (e.g., leaving home, gaining new insight about themselves and their families) may facilitate renewed connections between previously distant nonresidential fathers and children.",

A range of hypotheses on the correlation between social background and the course of placement are examined. It appears, for example, that children from low‐resource families come into contact with the social system earlier, and are placed outside the home at an earlier age than children from high‐resource families. Low‐resource children are more often placed in foster care, and are more often subject to contact restrictions. The article discusses whether these differences reflect a socio‐cultural discrimination. Secondly, a discussion is raised whether the supportive measures available are adequate in relation to the serious problems of the families concerned.",

      "title": "Family Caregiver Self-Identification: Implications for Healthcare and Social Service Professionals",
      "abstract": "Reluctance to acknowledge the role. To become a caregiver, we must cross a threshold whose other side is unexplored and often threatening. -B. W. McLeod Family members and friends caring for ill and disabled people experience a number of rewards and hardships in managing their responsibilities. Although many caregivers find their involvement brings them closer to the care recipient and identify other benefits they derive from the experience (Goldman, 2002), caregivers also experience many negative consequences. These can include loss of employment opportunities (National Alliance for Caregiving/National Center on Women and Aging, 1999), psychiatric illness (Yee and Schulz, 2000), and even death. Given that 71 percent of caregivers nationally report that they arc caring for someone with a long-term or chronic illness (National Alliance for Caregiving/AARP, 1997), providing support to families throughout the course of illness is essential. But, what happens when the families and friends providing care do not even know they fall under the caregiver category? What happens when a spouse providing twenty-four-hour hands-on care for an elderly husband, or a daughter caring for both of her frail parents, does not realize that she is part of a large and growing group-family carcgivers? And how do hcalthcare and social service providers reach those caregivers who may be in need of support and resources but are not even aware that the support group at the local senior center, for example, is relevant to their situation? This article addresses these questions and describes a program that recognizes die problem and reaches out to caregivers, self-identified or not. A study by the American Association of Retired Persons (Kutner, 2001) points to the benefits of self-identification for family caregivers-that is, family caregivers defining themselves as such. In telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 4,037 adults, was found that those who identified with die term caregiver reported that they were involved in many activities diat were helpful to them in their management of responsibilities. In contrast, respondents who did not define themselves as caregivers and yet were performing many of die tasks were much less likely to be engaged in activities diat were helpful. For example, self-identified caregivers were likely to talk informally or with healthcare professionals about caring for a family member, to read about caregiving, or to ask for help with die tasks involved. As part of a National Family Carcgivers Association and National Alliance for Caregiving project on empowerment, Hoffman (2002) concludes that assisting caregivers to self-identify and to reach out for support enhances their ability to handle the role. Without this self-acknowledgement, caregivers may not take advantage of services that woiud help them and the recipient of their care. How Do FAMILY CAREGIVERS SELF-IDENTIFY? The transition to becoming a family has been variously described as drifting into the role (Finch, 1989, p. 204), moving from occasional helper to something more (Albert, 1994, p. 18), and ... die point at which concern, visiting and 'helping out5 become . . . caregiving (Given and Given, 1991, p. 94). Aneshensd and colleagues (1995) view as a career, albeit one that few desire. In their comprehensive description of die stages and transitions that family caregivers face, they write, Whereas people know precisely when they enter a job, entry into might be gradual and insidious, in some instances, becoming a fait accompli before one is fully aware of it (p. 21). From these writers' interviews of family caregivers of people suffering from dementia, diey conclude diat die onset of family has an amorphous quality (p. 27) and diat many family caregivers perform die required tasks long before dicy apply die label to diemselves. …",

All of these theories agree on one thing: it is a process, during which people pass on and absorb social values and norms, including the norms that apply to gender. Socialization is not a one-way process, in which our children acquire information from our “adult” world. It is rather a two-way process.&#x0D; Children socialize with each other in everyday interactions – both at home and away from home. In the theories of socialization at school, from the point of view of interaction, the focus is on the microsocial area, i.e the interaction between subjects. The basic concept of all interactions is therefore communication between the subjects. The individuals have a common set of symbols – speech – at their disposal and are confronted with the expectation of a stabilized behavior. The occurrence of violence in the child's family and in the social environment has significant socializing and educational effects, in a negative sense.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study attempts to compare levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation among elderly males and females, in reference to their living arrangement, i.e., community vs. nursing homes. For many elderly people, old age is characterized by various losses: physiological, functional, social, cognitive, financial, etc. The outcomes of such losses often include, more often than not, environmental isolation, a subjective feeling of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and frequently, loss of motivation to continue living. In light of the rise in life expectancy and the multitude of losses which can be associated with the aging process, it is probable that one out of five elderly persons will spend part of his/her life in a long term care institute. Such living arrangements may have negative effects on the mental health of its residents, because placement is often accompanied by feelings of lack of control over one's own life, and inability to make decisions regarding daily issues. Elderly persons living in the community (227: 78 men, 149 women) and 91 living in nursing homes (33 men, 58 women), in both independent and frail functional status (ADL), participated in the study. Findings show significantly more hopelessness, helplessness, and depression among residents of nursing homes compared to those living in the community, differences between men and women living in both environments, and a correlation between other demographic variables and the three dependent variables of the study. The conclusions of the study indicate a need to pay interdisciplinary attention to the mental health of elderly residents of nursing homes, particularly in the preliminary stages of placement and adjustment.",

      "title": "Foster Care: Policies and Practice in Working with Foster Families",
      "abstract": "Foster care refers to a situation in which children and young people live in other people's families. The majority of foster carers are ordinary families in the community who are recruited, assessed, trained and supported in caring for looked-after children on behalf of the local authority. Most of them have children of their own, either living with them or grown up. A foster placement can be for a single weekend to relieve a family crisis, or may provide a permanent home for a child who cannot be cared for by her/his birth family. It may be undertaken by relatives of the child under an arrangement with the local authority (Waterhouse, 1997, suggests 12 per cent of foster carers are relatives or family friends). The majority of the children fostered have experienced difficult and potentially damaging situations in their own families; many although not all wish nonetheless to return to them or remain at least in contact with them. In their foster families they often lack the sense of 'entitlement to be there' which usually characterises members of a family. Foster families therefore both resemble and differ from the families described in most other chapters in this book. This chapter describes the legal, statutory and policy basis for foster care, considers factors which the research suggests may make for successful fostering, and the role of social workers in contributing to this. It concludes with an illustrative case study.",

      "title": "The Case for Mom and Dad",
      "abstract": "Is the system of norms comprising traditional, natural marriage—featuring formally enacted, irrevocable, exclusive man/woman sexual union preceded by chastity—essential for children’s development and well-being, as Catholic teaching asserts? Review of an extensive body of diverse research finds that, compared to children continuously living with two parents, married parents, or their own biological parents, children in other family arrangements consistently experience lower emotional well-being, physical health, and academic achievement. Competing research has variously attributed this difference to a lack of married parents, two parents, complementary man/woman parents, or family stability, but these possibilities have not previously been studied in combination. To address this question, family structure differences and determinants of child well-being (reverse coded to show child distress) were examined using the 2008–2018 National Health Interview Surveys ( n = 82,635). Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for child emotional problems were higher with less than two parents (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.27–1.56), unmarried parents (1.46, 95% CI 1.31–1.61), unstable parents (1.55, 95% CI 1.27–1.76), or less than two biological parents (AOR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.55–2.87 for one biological parent; 4.77, 95% CI 3.95–5.77 for no biological parents). When combined in the same model, only the lack of joint biological parentage accounted for higher distress, with outcomes significantly worse without the biological father than without the biological mother (interaction AOR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.04–1.71). This evidence strongly supports the claim that maximum child development occurs only in the persistent care of both of the child’s own biological parents. Marriage benefits children primarily by ensuring such care. Implications are discussed. Summary: Children raised apart from the care of both natural parents consistently experience lower developmental outcomes. Traditional, religious marriage norms—a lifelong, exclusive sexual union between man and woman—benefit children by establishing strong conditions that promote such care. More than any other family arrangement, marriage assures to children the care of their own mom and dad.",

      "title": "Improving Child Support Guidelines: Can Simple Formulas Address Complex Families?",
      "abstract": "Child support guidelines, like most laws or regulations, were initially sim ple. Early guidelines tended to be easy to use, and generally worked best in the least complex cases: those in which both parents were self-supporting and had no extreme differences in income level; one parent (generally a mother earning less than the father) had sole custody; no one remarried (or, in the case of paternities, was already married); and neither parent had or went on to have any other children. Unfortunately for those who design or use guidelines, only a small minority of cases are so simple. Today, at least half of all divorces involve at least one partner who has been married before, and who may have pre-existing children.1 In paternity cases, either or both parents may already be married to someone else, and/or may be the parent of one or several other children, by one or several other partners. It also cannot be assumed that the mother in a divorce or paternity case will be the sole custodian, or that the noncustodian's earnings will always exceed the custodian's. Further complications commonly arise among cases under review for possi ble modification, months or years after the initial separation. An estimated 75 percent of divorced persons remarry, and many go on to have additional children.2 Especially challenging is the intricate balancing required when sev eral changes have occurred, some improving a party's financial status and others diminishing it. To date, there has been limited evaluation of the comparative ability of the basic guideline models?percent of income, income shares, and the Melson model?to achieve equitable results in light of the increasingly broad and",

Children worked on a practice object sorting task alone, or were aided by sibling or mother, prior to a test administration of the object sorting task. When children were helped by their older sibling, those with older sisters used more descriptive and inferential categories than those with older brothers; when children were helped by their mothers, those with older brothers used more descriptive and inferential categories than those with older sisters (p < .05).

      "abstract": "Although previous research has highlighted the importance of the quality of nonresident father-child relationships for children's well-being, little is known about children's perspectives on what underpins feelings of closeness to their nonresident fathers. This qualitative study explored the processes that facilitate or constrain children's feelings of closeness to their nonresident fathers. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 27 children (ages 8 to 17) who had grown up in a single-mother household, where fathers were nonresident from early in the child's life. Findings revealed the fragility of children's ties with their nonresident fathers and the risk that nonresidence from the outset placed upon these relationships. Children's experiences of closeness to fathers were related to perceptions of their fathers' commitment to their relationship and his obligation to his parenting role, and to a sense of connection to and familiarity with their fathers. It was a challenge for children to feel connected to their fathers when contact arrangements were detached from caregiving activities and precluded immersion in each other's daily lives. Lack of effort on the part of fathers to maintain contact or failure to keep arrangements constrained children's feelings of closeness and gave rise to feelings of disappointment and anger. Children demonstrated their capacity to act as agents within their families as they made sense of these relationships for themselves and accepted or rejected their father as a person who could play a meaningful role in their lives. The implications of the findings for promoting positive relationships with nonresident fathers are discussed.",

The goal of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of family contacts that are maintained in old people's residences, as well as the old people's degree of satisfaction with such contacts. A sample of 50 institutionalized people over 70 years of age completed the Cuestionario de Evaluación de Calidad de Vida en contexto Residencial (CECAVI-R, in Spanish, the Questionnaire to Assess Quality of Life within a Residential Context). The results show that the oldest people in the residences have more frequent family contacts. Taking gender into account, the frequency of family contacts varied as a function of the visitor (grandchildren, siblings, etc.). Lastly, the analysis of satisfaction with family relations was positive, and the younger inmates displayed the least satisfaction.",

Pada masa remaja sering menghadapi permasalahan sehingga remaja merasa bimbang dalam menentukan pilihan. Lingkungan keluarga berperan penting dalam menentukan masa depan remaja namun tidak semua remaja dapat memiliki keluarga yang ideal, sehingga dapat menyebabkan seseorang masuk dalam sebuah lembaga yang bernama panti asuhan. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui kenakalan remaja yang tinggal di panti asuhan. Subjek dalam penelitian ini adalah remaja yang tinggal di panti asuhan yang memiliki karakteristik sesuai dengan pokok permasalahan, yaitu berusia 15-17 tahun yang melakukan kenakalan remaja meliputi merokok, membolos sekolah, berbohong pada pengasuh panti, keluar panti tanpa seijin pengasuh panti. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan fenomenologi: sebagai pengalaman subjektif, suatu studi tentang kesadaran dari perspektif pokok seseorang dengan menggunakan metode observasi dan wawancara dalam pengumpulan data. Metode analisis data menggunakan codding (Moleong, 2007). Hasil penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa kurang kasih sayang, kurang mampu mengontrol diri, mudah terpengaruh dengan teman-temannya, faktor ekonomi keluarga yang kurang, serta kurang adanya pengawasan dari orang tua, guru serta pengasuh panti membuat remaja panti berperilaku yang bertentangan dengan hukum, agama, dan norma yang berlaku dimasyarakat seperti berkelahi dengan teman, mencuri, merusak, memeras serta mencopet. Remaja juga mencoba-coba hal-hal baru yang dapat merusak dirinya sendiri seperti mencoba merokok, minuman alkohol, mencampur minuman alkohol dengan minuman soda, mencampur minuman alkohol dengan obat penghilang rasa nyeri yang dijual di pasaran atau minuman soda dengan obat penghilang rasa nyeri yang dijual di pasaran, serta minum obat penghilang rasa nyeri yang dijual dipasaran dalam jumlah banyak.",

If there is no possibility to secure the safety for the child, the patronage is assigned. The goal of patronage is to secure the child’s education and attendance in the environment where he/ she could grow, develop and progress properly. The aim of the research was to ascertain if the patronage (child separation from his/ her family and lodging into patronage institutions) corresponds the safety requirements, and if it is possible to implement the goal of the temporary patronage, i.e. to return a child into the family. The research revealed that children who were appointed a patronage because of the violence incurred in a family, having relationships with their parent continue to incur the violence further. The effects of violence incurred in a family are the following: insecurity in a family and arising suicidal thoughts; the more frequent violence from the parents part, the less safety feel in the family and the more frequent arise of suicidal thoughts. The child patronage institution does not meet the safety requirement because the child’s separation from a family and lodging into patronage institutions is not effective: having relationships with their parent children continue to incur the violence further.",

This research has largely overlooked the role of doubling up as a housing strategy, with \"hosts\" (householders) providing housing support for \"guests\" living in their home. Yet, understanding children's experiences in doubled-up households requires attention to host/guest status. Using the American Community Survey and Survey of Income and Program Participation, we identify the prevalence of children doubling up as hosts and guests in different household compositions (multigenerational, extended family, nonkin), show how this varies by demographic characteristics, and examine children's patterns of residence across these household types. We find large variation by demographic characteristics. More disadvantaged children have higher rates of doubling up as guests than hosts, whereas more advantaged children have higher rates of doubling up as hosts than guests. Additionally, compared with hosts, guests more often use doubling up as a longer-term strategy; a greater share of guests live consistently doubled up over a three-year period, but those who do transition between household types experience more transitions on average than do hosts. Our findings show the importance of attending to both housing status and household composition when studying children living in doubled-up households.",

Rural Latino/a adolescents move in limited social circles and experience geographic, cultural, and social isolation due to immigration status problems, socioeconomic issues, racial discrimination, and family dynamics. This limitation is reflected by personal networks that tend to be homogenous in terms of ethnicity, age, and sociodemographic characteristics. School, although characterized by weak social ties often disconnected from community and family contacts, emerged as the dominant context of sociability where adolescents build their social identity outside the circle of dense family ties. Findings suggest a critical need for interventions to reduce isolation and enhance social connectedness between family, school, and rural community in this population.",

Couples perceived that their families are positively supportive, non‐supportive, or ambivalent in their support. These perceptions led to positive or negative emotional reactions in the couple members and to specific coping. The majority of couples perceived that family support (or lack of support) had an effect on the quality of their couple relationship.

Mothers' and their children's accounts of and present thinking about their past relationship were highly similar, indicating that the two parts develop concordant states of mind regarding their relationship. In contrast, there was no relationship between mothers' and their adult children's beliefs about mothering, suggesting that such beliefs are not simply passed on from generation to generation within families. Attachment/caregiving classification interacted with generation in influencing a belief that biological facts determine maternal behavior, young adults with preoccupied attachment being particularly prone to reject this idea. Attachment/caregiving classification also had a significant effect on participants' tendency to adhere to an idealized conception of mothering, this tendency being associated with a dismissive attachment/caregiving representation.",

Of particular concern are issues such as inflation, low purchasing power of the population, illegal migration in Russia, income inequality, unemployment and low wages, dissatisfaction with one's social status, lack of personal perspectives, social conflicts, disorder in life, crisis of morality, a high level of influence of the criminal subculture and the involvement in and genetic predisposition to alcohol and drug consumption, as well as defects in family, school and leisure education. There is also a growing materialization of social relations, mainly expressed in the upbringing of an egoistic person, in the lack of assistance from the social environment. The main cause of violent behavior is still problems in the family, as well as poor living conditions, lack of proper social control, drunkenness and drug addiction, homelessness, failures and mistakes in choosing a profession, disappointment in life, difficulties in school, at work, in the service. Stable are a high proportion of persons suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction, a high level of criminal trafficking of alcoholic beverages, a huge consumption of alcohol and drugs, which does not allow to fully ensure effective prevention of crimes committed in a state of intoxication. Until now, there is no developed system of social prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse, which consists in a complex of measures to rehabilitate and socially reintegrate persons suffering from alcoholism and drug addiction.

      "abstract": "Abstract The empirical study explores children's perceptions of the family and family membership. 300 four‐, six‐ and eight‐year‐old children were interviewed with a semi‐structured ‘Family Concept Interview’. Interview strategies and research findings are presented and discussed. Establishing field entry rituals and determining appropriate modes and levels of discourse are important factors for creating an interview situation in which children are continuously attentive and motivated. Findings indicate that children do have a generalised and complex image of the family. The majority construct relatively large families with two or more children; over half the children include grandparents (father and mother)’, but one‐parent‐households are also accepted as ‘a family’, regardless of the child's own family situation. ‘Common residence’ is an important but not a necessary criterion for family membership. The findings show significant age differences concerning some aspects of children's family concepts.",

The transition from suckling to consuming an omnivorous diet is critical to the child′s growth and health. Despite the necessity of a varied diet, children do not readily accept new foods, and are often very neophobic. Repeated experience is necessary to transform the initial neophobic response. The social contexts and physiological consequences of eating also shape children′s food acceptance patterns through associative conditioning, in which foods′ sensory cues are associated with the contexts and consequences of ingestion. Children are responsive to the energy density of foods and can adjust intake based on foods′ energy density. Such responsiveness is easily disrupted when parents employ child‐feeding tactics to control what and how much children will eat. Limited evidence suggests that such child‐feeding practices may focus the child away from hunger and satiety, impeding the development of internal controls of food intake in children.",

Aan de hand van een casus wordt een interventie beschreven, het ‘suicideverbod’, die aansluit bij zowel de psychodynamische factoren als de gezinssituatie die veelal een rol speelt. De interventie, die wordt beargumenteerd door de therapeut, gaat ervan uit dat de jongere nu nog niet oud en wijs genoeg is om de beslissing te nemen suicide te plegen. De interventie is op zich therapeutisch van aard omdat ze gericht is op het voorkomen van het ten uitvoer brengen van de suicidale wensen en/of plannen. Daarnaast is de ingreep voorwaardenscheppend voor verdere hulp gericht op de onderliggende problematiek, omdat met het verbod de optie van suicide als ontsnapping aan de pijnlijke probleemsituatie van de agenda wordt gehaald. Voorwaarde is vanzelfsprekend dat direct aansluitend vervolghulp wordt geregeld, als die er nog niet is. In de afgelopen twintig jaar is het verbod veertig tot vijftig keer toegepast. In het algemeen werd het verbod, zij het soms onder protest, geaccepteerd en heeft het tot goede resultaten geleid.",

      "abstract": "Good adolescent sexual health is the cornerstone of future healthy families and is essential for the development of optimal intimate and social relations including gender equality.1 Investing in adolescents’ sexual health may consolidate early gains, or offer a second chance to those who missed out during childhood.2 The right to access age-appropriate sexuality education at home and in school, and to tailored services for sexual and reproductive health, should be granted to all adolescents.3 Such services should be confidential, that is, without the obligation to inform parents or partners, should be delivered in a non-judgemental manner, and should include actual access to contraceptives and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Comprehensive sexuality education, that is, the provision of information and guidance tailored to different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds on physical and emotional aspects of growing up and starting relationships,4 has shown to effectively delay onset of sexual activity, reduce the frequency of sexual activity and number of sexual partners, increase condom and contraceptive use and reduce the experience of negative sexual health outcomes such as teenage pregnancies and infections with HIV or STIs.5 ,6 Several frameworks using evidence-based standards and criteria offer guidance on how to set up comprehensive or holistic sexuality education.2 ,7 Implementation requirements are known to be complex and need sufficient attention to avoid repetition of previous failures.8 Thus, the issue rather lies in the implementation and scaling-up of evidence-based strategies known to effectively improve adolescent sexual health. Implementation has lagged behind globally, as sexual health is typical a field driven by normative rather than evidence-based policies.\n\nThe highest burden of poor adolescent sexual health is found in low-income countries.9 Especially, vulnerable are adolescents who lack the basic school or home support (eg, out-of-school adolescents with no …",

Even when children in violent homes are not the target of abuse by parents, they are frequently involved in their parents' violence in other ways that put them at risk. Children are at physical risk when they intervene in their parents' fights or accidentally get caught in the crossfire. Children may also experience psychological distress, especially when they are in the position of having to report the violence to authorities and even testify in legal proceedings related to charges against a parent. This distress may be compounded by parents' attempts to blame the child for the parents' conflict and aggression.",

      "title": "Bullying entre pares na escola: desafio aos enfermeiros que atuam na atenção básica à saúde",
      "abstract": "We often face questions regarding the nurses’ role and the pertinence of their work regarding school violence. Do nurses have the required preparation? Does nursing care encompass dealing with school violence? Several elements are needed in order to answer those questions, including the need to contextualize nursing as a science and social practice capable of addressing the subjects’ needs, whether as individuals or groups. Nursing is also capable of establishing care within an epistemological approach committed to ethics, with the real relational encounter between the provider of care and those who receive it, with human empowerment and emancipation, and the evolution of societies(1-2). It is, therefore, necessary to consider nurses’ relationship with society, and, in this particular case, with violence in its most various types and as a public health issue. Both relationships are, in fact, premises to act without naivety: there is a close and intimate connection to be established. Nevertheless, a gap is still noticed in the practice, research or education level, that calls for nurses’ commitment in view of the problem of violence that is increasingly more common within schools: violence through bullying. This situation requires health professionals, namely nurses, to establish a care dimension under the perspective of promoting individual and group health through interdisciplinary and intersectoral practice. Thus, by establishing a practice connected and in line with primary health care, including the competencies and specificities of other fields, such as education, social work, psychology, and guided by activities of health promotion at school, through comprehensive care and health education, nurses can establish the means to work together to minimize and avoid bullying. In this sense, nursing should work through the everyday practice, attitude and involvement of the team and services, considering the presence of the “other” in the health care environment, and in organizing and diversifying the forms of “me-other” interaction and in “broadening the horizons of knowledge and actions” in health, from an intersectoral and interdisciplinary perspective(3). Nurses’ work and role in primary health care regarding the cases of bullying are established as a challenge within health units, when assisting children and adolescents, as well as outside the walls of the health unit. This work requires actions guided by health promotion, the development of educational practices in health, identifying signs and symptoms of violence and the consequent health needs, contributing with the education of health and education professionals, involve students, educators and families and focusing on children and adolescents. We highlight that every work developed in the school should consider it as a space for pedagogy and preparation, one that comprises the potentialities for health promotion and also the solution of the identified problems. Health education actions in this field are capable of intervening in bullying and avoiding it, therefore, it is also a concern for nursing. Those education actions have been built by establishing connections, knowledge and complementary dimensions between health actions, thinking and everyday living(4). To do this, nurses should develop health education practices that overcome the already existing traditional practices, which remain outlined by concepts focused on the biomedical model and on an individual practice, responding their discourses, strengthening political and economical interests hindering the development of an active subject who participated in group processes(5-6). In summary, the healthcare model that nurses must construct in view of violence and bullying at school requires professionals that broaden their knowledge and contribute with the production of scientific knowledge regarding violence at school. In this motion we must take hold of new theories and practices, and, at school, which is a feasible place for professional, intersectoral and collaborative practice, (re)build a model of child and adolescent to avoids and minimize bullying. Thus we would meet the challenge and ethical commitment of ensuring equity, protection and a life with more quality for children and adolescents. REFERENCES 1.

Queremos, a través de este enfoque, destacar las diferencias o incluso las desigualdades que emanan de las prácticas cotidianas de los indivíduos que componen la población estudiada en un contexto urbano. El proceso de envejecimiento supone una pérdida de autonomía progresiva y formas de dependências que tienen que ser observadas para comprender las prácticas diferenciadas entre individuos.

      "abstract": "Discussed here is the necessity of an inner process of separation from a maternal provider of care and the mother as a first oedipal object of love for the nonpathological early development of the young girl. The process of separation is bound up with necessary and intense reactions of disappointment in the mother and a destabilization of the young girl's feelings of her own value. It thus bears with it a threat of regression that could result in a fixation on the mother. Two such patterns of fixation, one of \"compensation model\" and the other the \"providing of care model\", are discussed. On the other hand, attention is also given to the progressive possibilities for coming to terms with the crisis in the relationship and the feelings of her own worth in the young girl. These possibilities are to be found in the young girl's decisive turning away from the mother in order to form her own identity by mobilizing and developing her own resources. This by no means implies an immediate turn to the father. First of all, this new object of love is already taken by the mother, and secondly, the girl wants to feel strong, not weak, in approaching him and must therefore keep him at a distance.",

      "abstract": "The modern way of life, characterized by the cult of individualism, discredited authority, and a proliferation of points of view about reality, has modified family structure. This social structure imbues families and the way that its members become ill, in such a way that eating behavior disorders (EDs) have become a typically postmodern way of becoming ill.The aim is to understand the systemic structure and vulnerability of families by comparing 108 families with members who have ED to 108 families without pathology. A questionnaire administered by an interview with trained personnel was used.Families with ED have a different structure from the families in the control group. They have more psychiatric history and poor coping skills. The family hierarchy is not clearly defined and the leadership is diffuse, with strict and unpredictable rules, more intergenerational coalitions, and fewer alliances. The relationship between the parents is distant or confrontational, and their attitudes towards their children are complacent and selfish, with ambivalent and unaffectionate bonds. In the case of mothers, this is manifested by separation anxiety and dyadic dependence. Their expectations concerning their offspring are either very demanding and unrealistic, or indifferent, and there is less control of their behavior, in addition to poor organization of the family meals.The structural differences between the two groups of families seem to be important for the occurrence and maintenance of EDs, although they may not be the only cause. The results suggest strategies for clinical intervention in EDs.",

      "title": "Coercive Control in Children's and Mothers' Lives",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book sets out to revolutionize our understanding of how children are affected by coercive-control-based domestic violence. It provides a new child-centered perspective, replacing the question “How are children affected by exposure to physical violence?” with an inquiry into how children are affected by perpetrators’ continuous actions of coercive control (actions that may, or may not, include physical violence), and what the road to recovery is like for children and mothers who have experienced coercive control. The focus is on the child and the mother as co-victims and co-survivors of behavior by the perpetrator (frequently, though not always, the child’s father). Children have rarely been recognized in this way as direct victims and survivors of domestic violence. Instead they have usually been viewed as suffering indirect harm through seeing, hearing, or being aware of the ill-treatment of their parent. Yet, in reality, coercive control pervades their entire world, as it does the world of their mother, profoundly altering their experience of life. Coercive control traps children and mothers together in a cage of control: and once able to separate from the perpetrator, children and mothers face new challenges together. This book charts, and systematically analyzes, the recoveries of children and mothers in getting free and building new lives. It highlights their journeys toward family lives based on mutual supportiveness, where all have influence, all are respected, and all have the space and autonomy they need to thrive.",

Stoicism in the military, or the need to be ready, maintain the face of a healthy family, and do what is expected without showing discontent or dissatisfaction is an important dynamic. A second critical dynamic is secrecy, or not allowing what happens in the family, impact the military parent’s career. A third dynamic of denial is present in most military families as they make numerous transitions and experience issues like deployment of the service member. In order to survive, the nonmilitary parent and children often deny the emotional aspect of these transitions, as well as more “normal” developmental transitions. In many parent-focused military families, particularly when there is a child who is acting out or in other ways exhibiting behavior problems, these three dynamics often lead to other characteristics such as the belief that the child is the problem, rather than the child may have a problem.",

Various negative assumptions often arise, such as children who are raised by single parents have deviant behavior. However, in this study, examples of cases were found if in the world of psychology, including real cases is unique and rare. Because single parent children in this study were able to prove to the public that their attitudes and behavior were not like the general theory. Her responsive and independent attitude can be used as a role model for children her age. This is because the parenting style of the subject's mother is very serious in educating her child. In addition to the parenting style of the parents, there are several other factors that support the formation of the child's character. Such as the neighborhood where she lives, friends in everyday life and the school where she studies. So in this study it was found that children from single parent parenting did not always have deviant behavior. Although it is very minimal to get parental supervision, the subject has high social resilience to herself and others.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Child bearing is a period of psychological challenges that must be viewed in a social context. This study reports the maternal transition from the perspective of Iranian first-time mothers in the first year after childbirth. Materials and methods: Qualitative method was chosen for explanation of mothers' individual experiences of motherhood.26 first-time mothers (aged 18-35 years old with various socio-economic status) who had delivered between 0-1 year prior to the interviews participated in the study.Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and interview transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results: The core category was called \"Regaining advanced balance.\" There were several themes within this category: \"internal conflicts\", \"encounter and interaction\" and \"internalization\". They felt unpreparedness, lack of control over their lives, incomplete maternal feelings and unstable relation to their husbands and others. Within the first postpartum days and weeks a sort of attachment develops between mother and child as the mother starts to attain a better understanding of maternal feelings; she begins to accept the child as an independent identity and reconstructs herself. As the attachment to child deepens, the mother feels control over the affairs. She realizes a kind of development and integration in herself which specifically stems from becoming a mother and attempts to strengthen family bonds. Conclusion: Through the expression of new mothers' experiences toward motherhood, healthcare providers can reach a better perception of the emotional and psychological changes as well as the various aspects of mothers' acceptance of their maternal role and helps a better preparation and presentation of effective training programs for mothers and families.",

Self-esteem is a personal phenomenon that directly affects the regulation of human behavior and activities.

Self-esteem is an element of an individual`s self-consciousness, which involves self-assessment, and personality`s assessment of his or her capabilities, qualities, and places among other people. It is an important behavior regulator. As a social phenomenon, it may undergo contradictory changes because it depends on a variety of personal and social factors. In ordinary and familiar situations elderly people`s self-esteem is positive; they focus on their positive qualities. Changes in elderly persons` life often cause difficulties and problems in adapting to a new situation. It negatively affects their attitude towards themselves and their self-assessment.

      "title": "Child Support and the Custodial Mother's Move or Remarriage",
      "abstract": "When a custodial mother marries a new partner, the income of the custodial household rises. The stepfather may earn much more than the father, or much less. He may or may not assume the social role of father, but his day to day contact and interaction with the child will often be more than the father’s. If the mother and stepfather move together with the child to a location distant from the father, he may be more likely to replace him in the child’s life. Whatever a stepfather’s legal obligations of support, economic realities ensure that his income will have an impact on the child’s financial well-being, and possibly a major impact. Yet the usual understanding is the law excludes the income of the mother’s new husband from consideration in setting the father’s child support obligation. Nor does it consider the impact of the remarriage, or any move, on the ability of the father to maintain a paternal relationship with the child. While these categorical exclusions are found in nearly every state’s formal rules, there are nonetheless examples of departures from them, some longstanding, that exist in particular circumstances, when the economic and social realities have overridden them. The increasing tension between the traditional rules and modern economic and social realities seems likely to present occasions to consider the rules’ reform. This paper asks whether the traditional rules are in fact consistent with the beliefs of citizens as to what the law should provide. It does so by presenting a random sample of several hundred citizens with a set of cases in which they are asked to decide the appropriate level of child support. We then infer their preferred rules by considering how their answers vary with changes in the custodial mother’s circumstances. Results in the cases are supplemented with Likert questions probing citizen views on statements of principle. The results show considerable support for taking remarriage into account in setting child support obligations, especially when the stepfather’s income is higher. While the mother’s relocation to a location distant from the father does not alone affect the support judgments of most respondents, the same move has a significant impact on respondents’ judgments when it is combined with either remarriage or an increase in the mother’s income. These effects are seen in both male and female respondents, although females are less responsive than males to remarriage without relocation. Our respondents appear to take both social and financial factors into account in these judgments, and overall prefer rules that are more nuanced than the categorical rules found in traditional child support law.",

      "abstract": "Social workers have long recognized that when the family is viewed as the “client” rather than focusing only on the child, parents need to feel included and essential to aspects treatment. Child and youth problem behaviors serve a function with the family system and are initiated and maintained by maladaptive interpersonal processes. Children who are socially competent and prosocial in their behavior have parents who use exemplary parenting practices, such as offering regular amounts of praise, providing adequate supervision, maintaining a safe home environment, using nonviolent discipline techniques, and providing consistency through routines and supportive interactions with their children. Children of effective parents experience family cohesion, warmth, harmony, and the absence of neglect in their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter identifies excellent programs to improve practices and child, youth, and family functioning. However, to move forward in the field, researchers and practitioners need to move away from treating problems and more toward preventing problems. To address problem behaviors, more attention needs to be placed on the lack of support in the environments of children and youth, specifically the lack of support in families, schools, communities, and in the socio-political context. Policies need to be directed to improving the environments of children and youth rather than on changing individual characteristics or behaviors. In this way, research can inform policy and the involvement of parents, policy makers, and politicians can demonstrate how essential it is to have a rationale for multiple problem prevention programs because at-risk children and youth are at risk for multiple negative outcomes because of their dysfunctional and stressed environments. There is now sufficient knowledge about the characteristics of effective programs for researchers and practitioners to support policies that encourage multicomponent, coordinated preventive interventions.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\nfamily based practice;\r\nyouth;\r\nchildren;\r\nsocial work practice with families",

      "abstract": "A relocation dispute arises when one parent proposes to move with their child to a new geographic location and the other parent objects to the proposal. Defining relocation is complex, because the key issue is usually not the distance of the move itself, but rather the effect which it would have on the child's relationship with the other parent and others who would be left behind. Consequently, for one family, a move of hundreds of miles might have little effect on these relationships (if, for instance, the child was having only indirect contact with the parent anyway), while for another family, moving to the next suburb could significantly change existing relationships (such as in a shared care arrangement). Whether a move constitutes a relocation or not therefore depends more on interpersonal than on geographic factors.",

The total amount of care experienced over the course of a weekday by 35 pairs of toddlers (1 member of each pair in child care, 1 member not) did not differ according to whether the toddlers spent time in child care. Although the child-care toddlers received lower levels of care from care providers in the centers, their mothers engaged them in more social interactions during nonworking hours than did the mothers of home-only toddlers, which suggests that families using child care provided different patterns of care than families not using child care. Child-care toddlers experienced high levels of emotional support at home, although they experienced less prompt responses to their distress signals. Mothers' ages were unrelated to the amounts of time toddlers spent with them, but older mothers initiated more proximity.",

This paper focuses on a single case from which more general conclusions are then drawn. After an earlier episode of bulimia, a girl suffering from anorexia was found to live in a family context in which the father provided a weak psychological reference point. He was often away on work during the girl's childhood and only takes part in the family life as the provider of material wellbeing without playing a direct affective or pedagogical role. A situation of this type represents a way of fulfilling family roles in today's society where ensuring the family's comfortable lifestyle acts as a substitute for the affective role which the parent is not able to sustain due to unresolved neurotic nuclei. Society can now augment certain forms of defence in view of efficiency and productivity which detract from a genuine personal evolution. This leads to the development of neuroses in the younger generation which the mental health services must identify and correct using new psychopedagogic proposals.",

For Latinx LGBTQ people specifically, Latinx cultural values, beliefs, and traditions (e.g., familismo, gender norms, respeto, religion and spirituality) play an important role in their relationship with their family members. To date, however, little is known about the unique experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual people within the context of their families. In a sample of 63 Latinx bi+/plurisexual people, we used a qualitative approach to explore: (a) factors leading to the disclosure of one’s bi+/plurisexual identity to family members, (b) experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual people within their Latinx families after disclosure; and (c) aspects of Latinx culture that influenced the experiences of Latinx bi+/plurisexual individuals and their families. Thematic analysis revealed five major themes: (1) decision-making process (presence of religiosity, fear of being excluded from the collective and violence, perceived negative attitudes toward bisexuality, selective disclosure, and disclosure of authenticity), (2) family reactions to sexual identity disclosure (acceptance, rejection, and invalidation, disregard, and erasure of bi+/plurisexuality), (3) cultural factors that influenced family reactions to disclosure of sexual identity (religion and spirituality, familismo and respeto, strict views on gender norms), (4) impact of family reactions on the individual (validated and affirmed, relieved and confident, hurt and disappointed, and identity concealment), and (5) impact of family reactions on the individual’s relationship with the family (stronger bonds and distanced, disrupted, and strained).

      "abstract": "La reticence sociale, soit le fait de s'isoler des autres malgre un desir de vouloir se joindre aux interactions sociales, constitue un facteur de risque important pour le developpement de problemes psychologiques et relationnels durant l'enfance et l'adolescence. Dans les situations sociales difficiles, les enfants reticents socialement sont moins competitifs, prosociaux et assertifs que les autres enfants. Par consequent, ces individus peuvent presenter, en grandissant, d'importantes difficultes d'adaptation dans une societe individualiste et competitive. Le developpement de la reticence sociale chez les enfants est a la fois explique par des facteurs de la genetique et des facteurs de l'environnement non partage. Cependant, aucune etude genetiquement informative n'a examine de facteurs environnementaux specifiques, ni les interactions potentielles entre les facteurs genetiques et de l'environnement, comme facteurs de risque pour la reticence sociale chez les jeunes enfants. Ainsi, il importait d'identifier les differents mecanismes environnementaux dans le developpement de la reticence sociale afin d'aider ces enfants a surmonter leurs difficultes psychosociales. Ainsi, les objectifs generaux de la these doctorale etaient d'identifier, selon une perspective genetiquement informative basee sur un devis de jumeaux, des facteurs de risque de l'environnement (c.-a-d., des caracteristiques et des comportements des parents et de pairs) associes a la reticence sociale chez des enfants d'âge prescolaire observes dans une situation de competition, tout en controlant ou en identifiant les interactions possibles entre les facteurs genetiques et environnementaux. Les pratiques parentales et les caracteristiques des parents (c.-a-d., les symptomes depressifs) ont ete mesurees a l'aide de questionnaires lorsque les jumeaux avaient 30 mois. La reticence sociale des jumeaux, ainsi que les comportements des pairs ont ete mesures a l'aide de la situation observationnelle du Movie Viewer (MV) a l'âge prescolaire (environ 72 mois). L'echelle ordinale de la predisposition genetique a la reticence sociale a ete creee a l'aide de la zygotie, ainsi que la presence ou l'absence de comportements de reticence sociale chez le co-jumeau a 72 mois. Les resultats de la these ont permis d'identifier des facteurs de risque de l'environnement, soit l'effet unique de la surprotection parentale sur le developpement de la reticence sociale chez les garcons, l'effet unique de l'hostilite paternelle sur le developpement de la reticence sociale chez les filles, ainsi que le role moderateur de la depression du pere. De plus, l'affiliation a des amis reticents socialement, ainsi que les comportements de dominance d'amis et de pairs non amis representent d'autres facteurs de risque importants dans l'expression de la reticence sociale chez les enfants d'âge prescolaire. Les resultats identifient egalement des differences liees au sexe de l'enfant. Les programmes de prevention et d'intervention qui s'interessent aux problemes associes a la reticence sociale devraient considerer l'enfant et son environnement social, en ciblant les caracteristiques personnelles de l'enfant, les pratiques parentales problematiques des le jeune âge des enfants, les symptomes depressifs des parents, ainsi que les comportements des pairs amis et non amis a l'âge prescolaire.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : reticence sociale, pratiques parentales, pairs amis et non amis, interactions gene-environnement, correlations gene-environnement.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The present study investigated child behavior problems, parenting styles, coparenting, and couple relationship satisfaction in 67 European gay father families via surrogacy and 67 European heterosexual parent families via unassisted conception, all with children aged 1.5–10 years ( M = 3.57 years, SD = 2.09). The two family groups were matched for child age and gender. In the gay father group only, the associations between family anti‐gay microaggressions, family/friend support, and other main variables also were explored. Children of gay fathers had fewer externalizing and internalizing problems compared to children of heterosexual parents. Also, gay fathers reported more effective parenting styles, greater coparenting quality, and higher couple relationship satisfaction compared to heterosexual parents. Overall, child externalizing problems (i.e., aggression, rule‐breaking) and internalizing problems (i.e., anxiety, depression) were more strongly associated with being raised in a heterosexual parent family, more authoritarian parenting, and lower positive coparenting. Specific to the gay father sample, anti‐gay microaggressions experienced by family members were associated with more child internalizing problems, lower positive coparenting, and lower social support from family and friends. These results refute concerns about possible detrimental effects on child development of surrogacy conception or of being raised by gay fathers. The results further suggest that family therapists treating child behavior problems should focus mainly on improving the coparenting relationship, reducing authoritarian/punitive parenting styles, and (for gay father families specifically) coping with anti‐gay microaggressions and lack of social support outside the nuclear family.",

It purposefully covers a range of topics, including: (1) the meaning of intimacy and the significance of sexuality, providing a basis for the use of these terms throughout the book; (2) death, grief, and differences in sexual orientation, including death and intimacy in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and the endured by young people due to gender issues; (3) loss of relationship and restoration of intimacy in families, including pharmacological effects on the grief processes of widowers; grieving a not-so-loved parent; the layered losses of infertility and intimacy; and the tolls of war--intimacy and sexuality challenges for soldiers and their families; (4) adjusting to life's associated with aging or illness or infirmity, including Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses, physical health after 50, and intimacy, sex, and hospice--self-determination and dignity at the end of life; and (5) religious bases that have shaped our perspectives for understanding intimacy, sexuality, and healing after loss, and which give us hope--including the spiritual reflections of a rabbi and a Christian voice in defining what is right. Set in a framework that is both psychological and spiritual, the well-researched contributions are intended to acknowledge these experiences both professionally and personally. The book concludes with an extensive bibliography, valuable for research and reference. This book will be of value in undergraduate and graduate courses on thanatology, as well as for anyone interested in knowing more about grief--both those currently bereaved and those who wish to support others in mourning. The contributors appreciate both the importance of our capacities for intimacy and sexuality and our inhibitions and hesitations in giving voice to our needs and concerns, perhaps especially when we are grieving. The information and compassionate understanding they provide encourage us to bridge the gap between the secret and the private and to share what is close to our hearts.",

The authors consider the effects of three factors: the elderly persons’ health situation, their family resources, and their social participation, such as community workshops or political activities. Accordingly, the authors propose empirical logit models based on the well-developed discrete choice theory. Empirical results reveal that (1) elderly people with higher socioeconomic status, prefer either independent living arrangements or coresidence with their children, (2) elderly people with more family resources, such as large family size, prefer to coreside with their children, and (3) elderly people with adequate social support and/or contact networks prefer independent living arrangements.",

Parents of firesetters reported more psychological distress, marital disagreement, and exposure to stressful life events, and less child acceptance, monitoring, discipline, and involvement in activities that enhance the child's personal development and family relationships, than nonfiresetters. Firesetting children characterized their parents' child rearing practices as involving lax discipline, nonenforcement, and anxiety induction.

      "abstract": "Contemporary family life and intimate relationships are characterized by a new and increasing heterogeneity. In the growing body of research on this differentiation of family patterns and practices, the role of older people has largely been ignored. Studies of the family life of older people often deal with the adjustments that take place between couples when their children have left home or with the attempts of widows and widowers to come to terms with a life without their lifelong partners (for research reviews, see Allen et al., 2000; Borell, 2001; Brubaker, 1990; Goldscheider, 1990). When, on rare occasions, the important changes that have occurred in family life and intimate relationships are recognized, they usually deal with the indirect effect these may have on older people, such as the consequences of their children's divorces for their roles as grandparents (see, for example, Cherlin and Furstenberg, 1986). For each new cohort of the ageing population this omission becomes less defensible: to an increasing extent the \"young old\" (sixty-five to seventy-four years of age) in particular are prime movers in the process of the differentiation of family forms and practices.",

On being admitted to a hospital, care home or hospice, when asked for ‘next of kin’, it is not uncommon for people to give the name of someone whom they want to be their main contact, not the person who will inherit any of the patient’s property. Issues associated with ‘next of kin’ and ‘nearest relative’, which is the term used in mental health legislation, can be confusing for practitioners, particularly when different sections of a family/loved ones are in conflict. Legal definitions of next of kin and nearest relative will be provided. There is also discussion regarding the responsibilities of healthcare staff when an accusation is made that a patient/ resident is being abused. The primary duty of health/social care professionals is to act in the best interests of patients/residents, particularly with regard to vulnerable people. The process that needs to be followed in such situations is outlined and definitions regarding ‘vulnerable’ adults are provided. Conflicts of interests: none",

      "abstract": "The intensive concern of society, pedagogics and medicine for the child with disturbed development places Down's syndrome in the center of a new and gratifying interest. People from the most diverse disciplines are now concerned with mongoloid children, many simply following the trend of the times. Whoever has the care not only of the mongoloid child, however, but also of adolescents and adults, is very well aware that there are a series of processes in the physical, spiritual and mental development of the child through to adulthood in which an apparently dynamic characteristic is inherent. Alone and concurrently with several factors they produce impairment of family life with which the relatives are no longer able to deal. The question as to the motive for handing over the mongol concerned to an institution or home often cannot be answered. There are numerous reasons which may apply alone or in combination. As the mongol becomes older, his relatives are also becoming older giving rise to further difficulties. The present study shows that the furture of the mongol child, i.e. his puberty, his adolescence and adulthood must be planned carefully and principally require pedagogical, therapeutic, sociological and organizational consideration and measures. At present the future of the patients under our care does not seem by any means secure and ordered. The euphoria which is obligatory in many places is not justified.",

It is claimed that communal sleeping and the relatively limited encounter with parents and siblings - limited in both time and function - did not enable the development of emotional bonds such as love and physical affection, at least not openly. An examination of the hermeneutical approaches of the third generation of those who grew up in kibbutzim regarding emotional expression within the family, shows that the different voices express an essential underlying code of dualistic tensions in the structure of kibbutz education. The case of collective education provides an example of how emotions and struggle can bring about social change.",

For all the dual-earners, the problems of combining parenting with employment led to immense pressures and conflict, as well as shortage of time in which to accomplish anything. Child outcomes are dependent on parental attitudes, parental behaviour, family structure and other aspects of the home environment, including work patterns, as well as upon the nature of the child and the care provided while parents are away. A long sequence of well conducted studies shows how infants from all classes and family backgrounds are significantly more likely to have insecure and disturbed relationships with their parents where there is extensive non-maternal care. In turn, children of mothers in full-time manual or non-manual employment, and those who had recently left employment, had higher anti-social behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Young adulthood is a developmental phase occurring between the ages of 18 and 25 years with social, physical, and cognitive characteristics that distinguish it from adolescence and adulthood (1). Often referred to as “emerging adulthood,” this stage, for many individuals, involves transitioning from a parent-directed adolescent experience largely taking place at home and school to independent adult roles and experiences, separate finances, and their own mature relationships (1). As a result, the young adult period is inherently unstable due to multiple developmentally normative transitional events and competing educational, social, and economic demands (1).\n\nThe emerging literature base indicates that young adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes experience developmental challenges similar to those of young adults without diabetes, but with the added challenge of managing a complex chronic medical condition (2–4). Thus, the daily demands of diabetes care, including the need to coordinate daily self-management, find and engage with appropriate health care providers, and obtain access to supplies and medical care, must be incorporated into all of the normative decisions that young adults make related to relationships, occupations, living arrangements, and financial management (3,4).\n\nRecognizing the challenges that young adults with diabetes face, the American Diabetes Association in 2011 published a position statement on diabetes care in young adults (5). Among other things, this position statement called for a framework to guide treatment decisions for, and research with, this population (5). In the past decade, there has been an upsurge in diabetes research focusing on this unique and challenging developmental period. Nonetheless, most young adults with diabetes continue to struggle to meet glycemic targets, and these findings are even …",

Ada beberapa faktor yang menyulitkan perempuan korban KDRT untuk menyelesaikan masalahnya : a) masyarakat umum masih memandang masalah KDRT sebagai masalah pribadi keluarga, tidak boleh dicampuri, dianggap wajar karena suami ditempatkan sebagai kepala keluarga dan pendidik istri, b) masyarakat masih memandang keutuhan institusi keluarga ada di tangan istri, sehingga istri justru akan dipersalahkan dan dicela apabila institusi keluarga hancur, c) ada stigma di masyarakat terhadap perempuan berstatus janda, d) ada kecenderungan istri tergantung secara ekonomi maupun emosional terhadap suaminya, sehingga sulit bagi mereka membuat keputusan untuk berpisah atau melaporkan perbuatan aniaya suaminya. Hal yang paling sering muncul dan dominan adalah kebimbangan dalam membuat keputusan atas dirinya sendiri dalam menghadapi situasi kekerasan dari suaminya. Karakteristik rasa bersalah umum terjadi pada survivor kekerasan, bahkan seringkali si istri yang merasa bahwa dirinyalah yang bertanggung jawab atas semua perilaku kasar suaminya. Perempuan korban KDRT biasanya memiliki stres emosional yang berkepanjangan dan terus menerus (konstan) karena dirinya telah terjebak dalam siklus kekerasan tanpa dapat memotong siklus tersebut. Dinamika psikologis perempuan korban kekerasan, antara lain yaitu : merasa bersalah, merasa tidak berdaya (powerless), kemarahan yang mendalam, malu, cemas, gangguan tidur.

The burden on families who provide care to impaired elderly family members can be enormous but it can be reduced through extrafamilial assistance. Institutional care is often sought when the burden becomes overwhelming; and if institutionalized, the older person cannot avoid feelings of abandonment, and the family, feelings of guilt. Family involvement persists after the elderly person enters and lives in the institution. Although it can be expected that families will continue to be committed, willingness to provide home care may diminish because of changes in family caregivers: more daughters are likely to be working and more children likely to be elderly themselves and to be members of non‐intact families who may perceive familial obligations differently. It is unlikely that community based services can reduce the need for institutional care among those residual elderly who will not have family to care for them at home and who will have virtually no potential for restoration to the activities of everyday life.",

Empirical illustrations reveal five important lessons: that precarity often (1) has spillover effects across time, domains, and levels; (2) has social origins and consequences, bringing potential malleability and openness to intervention; (3) is felt acutely in and expressed through social relationships, making it an interpersonal phenomenon; (4) is experienced in distinct ways for women and men and members of distinct social groups; and (5) is associated with social inequalities, meaning that some of its causes, as well as protections against it, stem from the welfare state, thus making it a political phenomenon.",

      "title": "WHAT MATTERS TO OLDER CARERS: EVIDENCE FROM PRACTICE-RELATED RESEARCH",
      "abstract": "A third of the UK's six million carers are aged 65 years and over. Older carers disproportionately provide intensive care to their relative, care over many years and yet receive very limited support from care agencies. Research with older carers suggests that one of the key reasons for this failure is that policy and service models do not take account of 'what matters' to older carers. Older carers tend to protect the cared for person by resisting framing what they are doing as 'caring' nor identify as a 'carer'. As a consequence they are less likely to recognise the impact of caring on their health and wellbeing or seek help. The 'emotional work' older carers are involved in e.g. bolstering their relative's identity, tends to dominate how they 'become' carers. It is not instrumental care tasks that defines their role and yet this is how most agencies conceptualise caring and what often determines service allocation. That care is embedded in a relationship and a shared life-course is also important to older carers which is at odds with a model of assessment focused on an individual 'user' or 'carer'. There is also emerging evidence that the shift towards direct payments in UK welfare policy is linked not only to devolving responsibility for care decisions to carers but is also associated with the devolution of stress and increased anxiety. Until more of what matters to older carers informs policy and service development they will continue to be marginalised and unsupported.",

      "abstract": "The social networks of older people are a significant influence on their health and wellbeing. Adult children are an important element in their parent's network and provide the majority of informal care. The morphology of personal networks alters with age, employment, gender and relationships. Not having children automatically reduces both vertical familial structure and affects the wider formal and informal social links that children can bring. Childless men are missing from gerontological, reproduction, sociological and psychological research. These fields have all mainly focused on family and women. This paper reports on an auto/biographical qualitative study framed by biographical, feminist, gerontological and lifecourse approaches. Data were gathered from semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntarily childless men aged between 49 and 82 years old. A latent thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between childlessness and individual agency, relationships and socio-cultural structures. The impact of major lifecourse events and non-events had significant implications for how childless people perform and view their social and self-identity. I argue that involuntary childlessness affects the social, emotional and relational aspects of men's lived experience across the lifecourse.",

Respon anak pertama terhadap adik bayinya dapat mempengaruhi proses bounding attachment, bayi akan merasa terganggu dengan cara menangis. Jika terjadi berulang-ulang, maka tujuan bounding attachment yang mengharapkan bayi dapat mengadakan eksplorasi menjadi terbatas, sehingga menumbuhkan sikap sosial berkurang, dan menumbuhkan perilaku meniru sikap kakaknya. Faktor yang paling dominan terjadinya sibling rivalry pada anak yaitu sikap orang tua. Orang tua membagi perhatian dengan orang lain, mengidolakan anak tertentu, perasaan kesal, dan membanding-bandingkan anak dapat memicu terjadinya sibling rivalry. perlakuan orang tua yang adil dapat menjalin Kedekatan emosi orang tua dengan anak sehingga akan slalu memiliki ikatan batin (kasih sayang) yang kuat.

Kesimpulan: Ada Hubungan Sibling Rivalry Dengan Bounding Attachment Pada Ibu nifas di Desa Bae Kudus. Kata kunci : Sibling Rivalry, bounding attachment Abstract Background: In the Bounding Attachment process, there are several factors influencing the process including Rivalry Sibling or the behavior of child or baby with family that can grow from the child himself and the parents in giving education. Parental treatment to children is a key factor that determines the competition occuredamong the siblings. The first child's response to youger sister (baby) can affect the process of bounding attachment in the way that the baby will be disturbed by crying. If it happens repeatedly, the goal of bounding attachments that the baby will carry out exploration becomes limited, therefore it will reduce social attitudes and imitate his brother's attitude.The most dominant factor in sibling rivalry is the attitude of parents. This means that parents share attention with others, idolize certain children, feel upset with certain children, and compare children so that it may trigger sibling rivalry. Fair parental treatment will create close emotional betweenparents and children so that they will always have a strong inner bond (love). Objective: this study is to know the relationship between Sibling Rivalry and Bounding Attachment in Postpartum Mothers in Bae of Kudus. Method: This study used analytical correlation research with cross sectional approach. The population were 52 respondents. Taken accidental sampling, the samples were 46 respondents. Sampling was done by purposive sampling using inclusion and exclusion criteria of chi square (X2) test using 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The results of chi square test of Sibling Rivalry With Bounding, Sibling Rivalry with Bounding Attachment obtained p value of = 0.027.

      "abstract": "Abstract Children experience temporary or permanent separation from parental care for various reasons. Societies respond to their situation through informal kinship care and formal options such as fostering, residential care, and adoption. With increased state involvement in out-of-home care, standards for policy and practice have developed, including at the international level. Against this background, this chapter reviews three key challenges in providing appropriate alternative care for children: challenges related to standards themselves, general alternative care provision, and specific care settings; challenges arising from the context of implementing necessary reforms; and the significant challenge of preventing the need for out-of-home care altogether. The assessment of future options should take note of the increasing attention from both governments and civil society being paid to issues related to alternative care. However, it is essential to note that such assessments invariably occur within the context of resource limitations and the presence of increasingly significant and intricate challenges faced by children and their families.",

      "title": "Primary caregiving fathers and breadwinning mothers: social psychological mechanisms underlying the division of family roles",
      "abstract": "Over recent decades there has been significant progress towards gender equality in the workplace and at home. Transformations in work and childcare domains have occurred for families in Western societies, including de-gendered parenting, in which childcare responsibilities are shared equally or assumed primarily by the father. Although these arrangements constitute a recent and rare phenomenon, this increase in proportion has been matched by an academic interest.\r\nUsing quantitative data from traditional and role-reversed couples, this research aims to explore the social psychological mechanisms underlying non-normative behavioural choices, as well as the consequences for couples' relationship quality, well-being and life satisfaction. Traditional couples are those in which the mother bears primary responsibility for child care while the father is the main breadwinner. In non-traditional role-reversed couples the opposite occurs. A sample of 242 individual parents with children from birth to 12 years old, completed an extensive questionnaire. Involvement in work and childcare, social psychological variables, relationship and life satisfaction, perceptions of their division of responsibilities and socio-demographic characteristics were examined. Results show how social prescriptions and structural characteristics are limiting the intersection between the mother and the father role, and help us understand how both roles can be more similar than different. The findings also disclose how by being involved men are assisting women’s career and help make a distinction between traditional and role reversed women’s views of the appropriate parental role for men and women. Furthermore, the results contribute for a better understanding of how gender ideologies and non-essentialist perceptions differ between couples in different arrangements and how they relate to involvement in childcare and well-being, as well as the role of choice in well-being, life and marital satisfaction.",

This mixed methods study examined statements made by 459 grandmothers about core family relationships between grandmother and child, grandmother and parent, and parent and child. Families were grouped into intergenerational triad types based on patterns of closeness: all close relationships (triple-bonded), two close relationships (double-bonded), one close relationship (single-bonded), or weak relationships between all three family members (not-bonded). Well-being declined steadily for grandmothers from highest in triple-bonded, to lowest in not-bonded families, reflecting their high stake in all three core relationships. For grandchildren, well-being was low when the child failed to bond firmly to either grandmother or parent. On the other hand, children did well if they were close to their grandmother, even when substance abusing parents were emotionally isolated in the family, suggesting resilient children overcome parental neglect when provided with good grandparent care.",

      "title": "Wellbeing, participation and connection in the middle years of childhood",
      "abstract": "Ensuring the health and wellbeing of children is a fundamental societal goal, which is best achieved when children are connected to their communities, have opportunities for meaningful participation, and enjoy strong and supportive relationships across generations, within and beyond their families. This means investing in individual children and families and in their communities. It also means creating communities that are inclusive of children and actively providing pathways for children to participate in a range of social and civic activities. The purpose of this article is to highlight the relationship between participation, health and wellbeing, for children aged in the middle years. Middle childhood, defined here as between six and 12 years of age, corresponds with primary school. But children's lives are characterised by more than school. During middle childhood, children begin to gain independence while remaining strongly connected to their families, yet children's place is often understood to be either the family or school. Limiting children's domains to family and school has resulted in the privatisation of childhood and in their exclusion from public spaces, with deleterious impacts on social relationships.1 Loneliness among children in middle childhood may result from a lack of social connection and has serious implications for health and wellbeing.2 These concerns are exacerbated in a context of polycrisis encompassing challenges to children's wellbeing and mental health, from climate change to conflict, failing systems across welfare, education and health care and declining standards of living.3 Given the significance of middle childhood and complexity within which children live, there has been insufficient policy consideration of children's lives beyond school and family. Yet engagement with community, beyond school and family, is essential for children's sense of belonging, and their overall health and wellbeing.4 Without policy support, children's engagement with community is especially challenging for those whose families are under stress or experiencing financial hardship. Our argument here is twofold. First there is a need for policies and services to be more responsive to middle childhood. In Australia, there is a strong and justifiable focus on the early years. Yet, as we create the conditions in which children and their families can thrive during the early years of life, we need to take care not to create a policy and service cliff as children move into middle childhood. Our second argument is that efforts to foster children's health and wellbeing must consider how to build child-inclusive communities that are welcoming to children and in which children can actively participate in ways that are meaningful to them. The Future Healthy Countdown 20305 presents an opportunity to advocate for children in middle childhood and foster child-inclusive communities that create pathways for children's social and civic participation. Policy focus on the early years, in Australia and globally, is justified by a vast body of evidence.6, 7 Although Australia has long invested in young children, in the past, this has been primarily through cash transfers.8 Over the past decade, the policy focus has expanded to education, health and wellbeing. This is exemplified by the National Early Years Strategy, launched in May 2024, which promotes the vision that \"All children in Australia thrive in their early years. Children have the opportunity to reach their full potential when nurtured by empowered and connected families who are supported by strong communities\".9 The Australian Early Development Census provides powerful data across key dimensions of children's development (https://www.aedc.gov.au); the national Measuring What Matters Framework (https://treasury.gov.au/policy-topics/measuring-what-matters) includes a number of indicators for early childhood, and the establishment of a Minister for Early Childhood Education all point to a strong and growing commitment to ensuring children are well supported during the first five years. Yet the role of middle childhood in providing a critical bridge from the early years to youth is neglected in policy in Australia and globally.10 There is also a strong focus on youth. The National Office for Youth (https://www.youth.gov.au/) aims to connect young people and government, creating opportunities for genuine engagement and partnership in the development of policies and programs. The national youth strategy Engage! (https://www.youth.gov.au/engage) defines young people as aged 12–24 years. The Office for Youth steering committee comprises young people aged 13–24 years, and youth advisory groups consist of young people aged 16–25 years providing advice on a range of policy issues.11 Although these developments are welcome, they also highlight a significant policy gap for young Australians aged between six years and early adolescence. There is a missing middle. The invisibility of middle childhood undermines children's wellbeing and acts as a barrier to their social and civic participation. When children are isolated from their communities and have few intergenerational relationships or \"adult champions\" outside of school and family, they are more vulnerable to abuse and feel less safe.12 In most wealthy countries, children's lives tend to be bounded and shaped by two institutions: home and school.13 Public spaces are generally considered to be the domain of adults, where children are only welcome when accompanied by adults and/or engaging in ways that are acceptable to the adults, who are considered to legitimately occupy the space.14 The exclusion of children in middle childhood from public spaces, in Australia and elsewhere, is often justified on the grounds of protecting them from the dangers posed by strangers and traffic.15 The result is the privatisation of childhood,1 raising crucial questions around children's wellbeing, sense of belonging, safety and relational health. When childhoods are confined to private spaces, the potential for social isolation and exclusion becomes real. In policy terms, middle childhood is dominated by education. Children's wellbeing is enhanced when they are able to actively participate in school activities and decision making. Yet policies to promote active student participation are often inadequate and inconsistent.16 Schools are responsible for an ever-growing range of issues, from providing meals to ensuring children's wellbeing and mental health to addressing child protection concerns, in addition to delivering the nationally agreed curriculum. In the wake of restrictions due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been calls for schools to be further expanded and reimagined as multi-opportunity communities.17 Yet children's lives also exist beyond the school gates. The institutionalised nature of childhood means that there are few pathways for children to actively take part in social and civic activities outside of school. When children do participate in social and civic activities, adults (usually parents or families with the necessary resources, and sometimes teachers) are needed to act as conduits. Making schools the primary, or only, focus of policy and programs for children in middle childhood is problematic, and restricts children's lives to a single institution outside of their family in ways that marginalise them from their broader communities. Moreover, the reliance on schools and education policy in delivering children's wellbeing ignores the range of influences beyond schools that shape children's lives.18 Community inclusion and participation has the potential to deliver positive outcomes for children's health and wellbeing and reduce the reliance on schools as the dominant or sole institution responsible for supporting children or providing intergenerational relationships.19 Each of the authors of this article has undertaken research with children that has consistently highlighted the extent to which children value social and intergenerational relationships.20 Children in the middle years have told us that their sense of wellbeing is strengthened when they feel respected and valued and when they believe that they have adult allies who work with them in solidarity.21 However, children also tell us that they are taught to be scared of adults, that adults downplay their concerns and worries, and, increasingly, that adults outside of their families and schools can be reluctant to build relationships with them. The Australian Child Wellbeing Project found that family and friends consistently ranked as priorities for children in year 4, year 6 and year 8.22 School also ranked as important, but children were often somewhat ambivalent about it. Interestingly, almost one quarter of children in year 4 identified neighbourhood and community as important, but, by year 8, under 8% of children prioritised neighbourhood and community.22 In the Children and Communities in Australia project, children in middle childhood spoke of wanting to be part of and contribute to their communities, but often felt that there was no place for them.19 The exclusion of children in middle childhood from their communities might explain the decline in the importance children place on community or neighbourhood as they become older. Children who participated in the Children and Communities project also described feeling safer in their communities when they knew and trusted adults beyond their families. Feeling respected and listened to is crucial to children's own sense of wellbeing, but, too often, children describe feeling ignored and marginalised. Social relationships are essential to children's sense of wellbeing. Strong and supportive relationships help children to develop a sense of competence and agency.23 Positive and trustworthy relationships are especially important for children who have experienced abuse or neglect and have complex needs.24 Ensuring the wellbeing of children in middle childhood requires us to consider their place and participation not only within the institution of school but beyond. It is also essential to recognise that children's opportunity to actively participate in their communities is shaped by their family's resources, socio-economic status, knowledge of what is on offer, and connections. The opportunity to participate in social and civic activities is not only narrow for children in middle childhood, it is also unequal.25 Children who live in disadvantaged communities have described feeling unwelcome in affluent communities and worry that they will be blamed if something goes wrong.26 Children from families under stress and who are fearful about judgment can be particularly isolated and describe feeling invisible.11 Ensuring the health and wellbeing of all children requires an understanding of the intersecting issues that shape and constrain their civic and social participation, from involvement in sport and recreational activities through to participation in community leadership roles. It requires active efforts to genuinely include and support children and families who are on the margins. In developing policies to promote children's health and wellbeing, it is essential that middle childhood is made visible, and children in this age cohort are listened to. The current gap between ages six and 12 years is a significant shortcoming in the Australian policy landscape, but one that can be addressed by actively creating pathways for children in this age cohort to participate in and be part of their communities. In doing so, it is important to be focused on the contribution that safe and trustworthy social relationships make to children's sense of wellbeing. It is also essential that children are actively involved in determining the types of activities and connections needed to create child-inclusive societies that genuinely support children in middle childhood. As we reimagine children's place within our communities, and our policies, the role of school must remain crucial, but not to the exclusion of all else. Children in middle childhood should be visible, valued and included across community life; their health and wellbeing now and into the future depends on it.

      "abstract": "Pendahuluan: Perubahan psikologis mampu mempengaruhi kualitas hidup lansia, dimana lansia merasa kesepian. Kesepian yang dirasakan oleh para lansia biasanya disebabkan faktor interaksi sosial, dukungan sosial dan hubungan interpersonal yang kurang baik. Hasil penelitian di inggris menunjukan bahwa 9% lansia merasa kesepian dan 30% mengalami gejala kesepian. Sedangkan di Belanda lansia dengan usai 65 tahun mengatakan kesepian (41%). Tujuan: Mengetahui pengalaman kesepian para lansia dengan berbagai macam latar belakang dan budaya. Metode: penulisan artikel menggunakan metode systematic review dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Pencarian data menggunakan data based dari pusat data Ebscho, PubMeds, Cinahl, Medline, ScienceDirect, Proquest. Kata kunci pencarian Loneliness in elderly, qualitative study. Hasil: Pemahaman kesepian dari setiap individu berbeda-beda tergantung dari kondisi pengalaman di kehidupan yang dialami lansia, ada yang mampu mengatasi terhadap kesepian dan ada yang tidak. Beberapa artikel yang dibahas menunjukan bahwa kesepian pada lansia terkait dengan interaksi sosial. Interaksi sosial yang dilakukan oleh lansia menjadi salah satu faktor yang dapat meningkatkan kemampuan lansia dalam beradaptasi dengan keadaan hidup sendirian. Upaya peningkatan partisipasi sosial pada lansia dengan kesepian memang perlu keyakinan individu, penanganan terhadap ketakutan, nilai-nilai dan identitas. Kesimpulan: Kesepian merupakan masalah pada lansia yang harus mendapat perhatian dari tenaga kesehatan terutama perawat. Peran perawat guna mengatasi masalah kesepian pada lansia dapat dikaji dengan mencari penyebab kesepian dan pengalaman masiang-masing lansia. Metode mentoring, brienfriend, dan pendekatan budaya yang ditawarkan dapat digunakan untuk mengatasi masalah kesepian pada lansia.",

      "abstract": "Angka pernikahan dini dari tahun ke tahun terus mengalami peningkatan yang disebabkan oleh faktor ekonomi, faktor internal keluarga, dan faktor pergaulan. Kebanyakan pelaku pernikahan dini masih SMP dan SMA yang belum memiliki stabilitas emosi yang baik dan cenderung melakukan segala yang diinginkan tanpa memikirkan dampak yang akan terjadi. Banyak dari pelaku pernikahan dini telah memiliki anak, dimana dalam mendidik anak terutama ibu dengan nikah dini secara tidak sadar menerapkan pola pendidikan permisif. Keadaan pribadi dan sikap setiap anak yang berbeda, menjadikan tugas mendidik menjadi berat untuk dilaksanakan, dan berpengaruh pada keadaan emosi orang tua. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kestabilan emosi pelaku pernikahan dini dalam mendidik anak belum baik, hal ini dikarenakan pelaku pernikahan dini masih mudah terpengaruh emosi negatif yang dapat dilihat dari respon emosi yang ditunjukkan. Respon emosi berlebihan tidak sesuai dengan pengertian stabilitas emosi, yaitu keadaan emosi yang tetap, tidak mudah berubah, dan respon yang ditunjukkan tidak berlebihan. Dalam meredakan emosi negatif dan menyelesaikan permasalah yang terjadi, pelaku pernikahan dini lebih sering menyerahkan pada keadaan dengan anggapan bahwa emosi tersebut akan hilang jika dibiarkan, tanpa ada usaha untuk mencari jalan keluar atau metode penyelesaian masalah yang sesuai. Meski pelaku pernikahan dini belum memiliki stabilitas emosi yang baik, namun beberapa pelaku pernikahan dini telah mampu untuk menjaga stabilitas emosi mereka dengan cara menenangkan diri terlebih dahulu dan menyelesaikan permasalahan yang menjadi sumber emosi.&#x0D; &#x0D;",

      "title": "Family rituals in postdivorce families: The role of family structure and relationship quality for parents' and stepparents' attendance at children's birthdays",
      "abstract": "Objective: To investigate if divorced parents celebrate their children’s birthdays with their respective ex-partner and current partner, and whether they do so “jointly” with both. Background: Family rituals like birthday celebrations are important and meaningful events in people’s lives, but little is known about who partakes in these in contemporary postdivorce families. Method: We assessed whether divorced parents celebrated their child’s birthday together with their ex-partner (i.e., the child’s other biological parent), current partner (i.e., the child’s stepparent), and jointly with both. Dutch Data (N=2,451) was analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Most parents celebrated the child’s birthday without the ex-partner, but with the current partner. One quarter celebrated with both. The ex-partners’ presence was more likely when parents’ and their current partners’ relationship with the ex-partner was good; and less likely when parents had repartnered and when the ex-partner had sole custody or additional biological or stepchildren. The presence of the current partner was more likely in case of coresidence with the biological parent and when the ex-partner had a new partner; and less likely when the ex-partner had sole custody and when parents’ relationship with the ex-partner was good. Conclusions: Child-related family rituals mostly involve the “new” stepparent rather than both biological parents. The effects of relationship quality, co-residence, repartnering, and having additional biological or stepchildren highlight the importance of (step)parents’ willingness to interact with each other, structural opportunities for parent-child interactions, and parents’ shifting loyalties from their ex-partner to their new family.",

      "title": "Managing Service Delivery Systems and the Role of Parents during Their Children's Transitions",
      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of rapid change for young people and their families. It is a time of physical maturation, psychological growth, and the development of life plans. Teenagers must cope with a variety of adaptive tasks during this transition including the emergence of increasing self-direction and independence from family, the creation of an expanded self-concept, the development of social and romantic relationships, the definition of an occupational identity and the pursuit of vocational interests (Germain, 1991). This role change from adolescent to adult often includes graduation from school, employment, greater responsibility, and becoming more economically and socially independent. Adolescents with disabilities face the same multitude of changes, yet encounter additional challenges making this transitional period more troublesome. Recent studies have shown that outcomes for young adults with disabilities fall significantly short of their non-disabled peers. These outcomes include higher drop out rates (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1995), low attendance rates in post secondary schools (Horn & Berktold, 1999) and high unemployment (Louis Harris & Associates, 1998). In addition, youth with disabilities may rely more on family members rather than peers for social interaction (Dane, 1993). Limitations in social activities may ultimately affect self-esteem and self-concept in a negative way and thus create social isolation (McGraw-Schuchman, 1994). Finally, research indicates that individuals with disabilities also demonstrate low levels of self-determination (Wehmeyer, Agran, & Hughes, 1998). This enormous period of change has an impact not only on the young adult with a disability, but also on their families. This particular research chose to focus on the role of family members, specifically parents, during their young adults' transitions. Since the 1980s, research has helped rehabilitation professionals to understand the nature of the transition process for youth with disabilities and their families. The often-cited research by Ferguson, Ferguson, and Jones (1988) identified three simultaneous transition processes that families experience as their children with disabilities planned to leave high school. These included (a) the bureaucratic transition defined as the change from the special education system to the adult community service system; (b) the family life transition defined as the disruption of established routines needed to accommodate the changing life of the individual; and (c) the status transition, which involves all of the cultural implications that accompany the move from child to adult (Ferguson et al., 1988). The convergence of changes in personal status, family life, and systems relationships (Ferguson et al., 1988) makes the transition from school to adult life a time when family members explore and adopt a variety of unique roles. Through an extensive review of the literature, Hanley-Maxwell, Pogoloff, and Whitney-Thomas (1998) found that family members often take on the roles of organizational member and political advocate, service developer, the recipient of professional decisions, teacher and learner, family member and decision maker, and their child's problem source. Parents have also been found to continue in a nurturing role as they facilitate the transition from school-to-work by proactively engaging in work readiness activities, supporting education through interaction with school, and promoting good work values (Way & Rossman, 1996). Lehmann (1998) found that mothers of students with disabilities played a much more active role in the lives and transitions of their children and that they did not see their support roles as diminishing over time, compared to mothers of children without disabilities. Finally, Thorin, Yovanoff, and Irvin (1996) found that parents of young adults with disabilities wanted to create opportunities for independence while assuring safety and wanted to provide stability and predictability while remaining flexible to meet the child's ever changing needs. …",

      "title": "When Men Become Fathers: Men’s Identity at the Transition to Parenthood",
      "abstract": "Men in the transition to parenthood have to integrate fatherhood into their self-concepts and identities. Contemporary societies, in particular, provide two contradictory discourses for fathersto-be: (1) discourses which state that fathers are to take care of financial providing (as breadwinners), and (2) over the last decades, discourses that describe highly involved and caring fathers. Most men adopt the traditional position of a breadwinning identity and describe themselves as responsible for financial care. As a consequence they tend to show little attentiveness to their children’s needs. Still, some men take up nontraditional practices and engage in child caring. We found two types of identities for such involved fathers: the feminized fatherhood identity and the distinctive fatherhood identity. Paternal identities were formed within the discourses provided by their social environment. The identity of feminized fatherhood is characterized by rejection of other concepts, but also by a devaluation of their own position as marginalized men. The distinctive fatherhood identity, in contrast, is defined by negation of hegemonic concepts and a positive valuation of difference.",

      "abstract": "The article presents the results of the theoretical and empirical research of the reflection of parental attitude by children who are raised in full and non-existent families. At the theoretical level, the psychological conditions of the development of the family are analyzed, which are the implementation of functions by adult family members (parents), peculiarities of the family’s psychological climate, characteristics of marital relations. It is established that the changed composition and structure of the family influence the development of the child’s personality in the cognitive, intellectual, emotional and behavioural spheres. It is determined that the structural components of the family are its composition, a number of members, family functions, role structure and interpersonal relationships, cohesion, hierarchy, flexibility, external and internal boundaries of the family. As a separate type, a destructive (incomplete) family is identified as being in a modified structure (one or both parents is absent), the harmony of infamily relationships is disturbed, a marked imbalance in the implementation of family functions, and the inversion of roles is present. Empirically revealed significant differences in the reflection of parental attitudes by children from full and part-time families throughout the teenage period. It has been found that younger teens from destructive families are much less likely to reflect such types of parenting attitudes as adoption; cooperation; symbiosis in comparison with the interviewed teenagers from full families. It was stated that younger teens from full families considerably less often reflect such types of parenting attitudes as authoritarian hypersocialization and disability, compared to those surveyed by adolescents from single-parent families. In the group of the studied middle-aged adolescents, a similar tendency has been established: adolescents from destructive families show a decrease in average values of acceptance rates; cooperation; Symbiosis against the background of increase of average values of indicators on the scale of authoritarian hypersocialization and disability as compared to respondents of the control group. It is shown that there is a tendency to decrease the average values of indicators of teenagers from destructive families in comparison with adolescents from full families and in senior adolescents.&#x0D;",

      "abstract": "With population ageing, the demand for home care of the disabled elderly is increasing and a large part of care is provided by informal caregivers. This paper focuses on the determinants of care provision by children to an old, single and disabled parent. We focus on two-child families and apply a semi-structural methodology, already implemented on European data (survey SHARE). It makes it possible to distinguish between two types of determinants: structural determinants (individual, parental and family characteristics) and interactions (effect of the care provision of one child on the care provision of the other). The estimation of this model on data of the French survey Handicap Sante Menages (2008) highlights two distinct behaviors according to sibling rank. Indeed, if the care decisions of both children are sensitive to the characteristics of their parent, the older child reacts more on the sibling composition, whereas the younger child's decision is much more influenced by her personal characteristics. Interactions are found to be asymmetric: when the sibling provides care, the elder is more likely to be caregiver, whereas it is the reverse for the younger child. These differences are interpreted as follows: in two-child families, the older child provides care as a response of a socially-assigned role, whereas the younger child decides through a trade-off between the advantages and the opportunity costs of care provision",

      "abstract": "Muchas personas mayores, si no se ven debilitadas por dańos cerebrales, pueden mantener un sentimiento de bienestar hasta el final de sus días. Otras luchan duramente por encontrar significado. Las historias y factores personales como el impacto del estatus social y económico, las experiencias tempranas, la salud, el apoyo familiar y un sentido de la espiritualidad, por supuesto, juegan un papel importante a la hora de determinar la resiliencia existencial de los mayores. Al margen de los factores personales, la mayoría de los mayores comparten dos quejas comunes: la experiencia de un sentido creciente de inercia y el temor a estar solos. Estas aflicciones parecen desarrollarse en la última etapa de la vida y parecen más prevalentes en un contexto de cuidados en el domicilio. En ausencia de una estructura familiar de apoyo o en caso de salud delicada, muchas personas mayores se ven forzadas a recibir cuidados en régimen institucional como alternativa final. Desafortunadamente, esta alternativa tiene muy mala reputación, pero no resulta extrańo cuando, incluso en caso de óptimos cuidados en el hogar, parece imponerse un sentido de atemporalidad. En el mejor de los casos, los cuidados domiciliarios deberían ofrecer, además de una buena asistencia básica, un escenario de lucha con la eterna pregunta, \"Cuál es el sentido de la vida?\"- una cuestión que cambia radicalmente y alcanza una clase de complejidad completamente diferente al hacernos mayores y no poder ya movernos por el mundo como solíamos hacer. En este artículo, describo cómo pueden ayudar los grupos de psicodrama a personas mayores a transformar algunos de los desafíos del sentimiento creciente de soledad y falta de sentido que soportan muchos mayores institucionalizados en esta última etapa de la vida. Los ejemplos que se presentan pertenecen a un grupo de psicodrama de frecuencia semanal con participantes de 75 a 94 ańos de edad. El proyecto de 5 ańos (1), financiado por el ayuntamiento del sur de Estocolmo (2) ha representado una oportunidad única para plantear cómo un intercambio terapéutico significativo puede ayudar a los mayores institucionalizados a enfrentarse con la edad y la enfermedad.

The research focus was on the adjustment of substitute family system after admission of a child 4 – 7 years old. The method used was grounded theory (Strauss & Corbin, 1999). The data were obtained by interviewing members of three substitute families. 13 interviews were analyzed on the level of open, axial and selective coding. Acceptance was the core category of the theory evolved. There were three dimensions of acceptance: acceptance of the children as own, acceptance of the specificity of the family, and acceptance of the family by children. Acceptance of the children as own was influenced by children’s characteristics. Negative characteristics and their perception as strange lowered the level of acceptance of children as own. The strategies used were effort to change children, accommodation to children and devotion to children. All the strategies were working in relating to children. Acceptance of the specificity of the family was influenced by children’s level of adaptation. The strategies used were solving problems and getting an outside help, which both led to gaining competencies of parents or ability to identify as a substitute family. From the children’s perspective there were strategies identified, that enabled them to accept their actual family and belong in it.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims for to get the principle of the dwelling space planning for the intellectual disabled persons, by analysis on the research data about daily living schedule and questionnaire about behavior in housing. The available style of dwelling life is classified 3 types as follows, l) the specializing type for public and private space, 2) the partial type in public or private space, and 3) the spreading to housing type. The specializing type have problems for adaptability to circumstances because of the tendency to holding to the norm on living activities. The partial type and the spreading type have to be free from the persisting in their own behavior by the way of differentiation or continuation on living space for the arrangement their available style to be stabilizing and suitable in dwelling life with family or roommates.",

      "abstract": "Few moral obligations are more keenly felt or more energetically asserted than the duties of parents toward children. In part this is because of the intimacy of the relationship. If we treat those closest to us badly, how can we be expected to treat anyone well? In part it is because of children’s neediness and vulnerability. People depend on others throughout their lifespan, but after infancy one is never again in the position of both being utterly helpless and having a whole life to lose. The urgency of parental duty may also reflect cultural influences. We see around us countless ways in which lives can go terribly wrong. If there is any way for parents to immunize children against tragically flawed choices, it seems obvious that they have a duty to do so.",

The family as an institution enabled mankind to face successfully the adverse conditions to which it was subjected for thousand of years. Now the role of the family is changing, but this raises the problem of whether to accept a new way of life or follow traditions. No uniform solution is applicable to all places or to all s ocial strata within each country. It is necessary to limit the number of unwanted children that cannot be properly raised, but most women can only resort to abortion, which is unlawful and dangerous. Education in family planning must begin in primary school and promoted among parents. It is necessary to explain that the tradition of early marriage must be stopped, and parents must wait until they are able to p lan their family responsibly and to support and educate their children.",

      "abstract": "Beliefs about intergenerational obligations to assist older adults are known to be influenced by contextual variables such as the type of kin relationship (i.e., stepparent, parent) between older and younger adults. One contextual variable that has not been studied is the degree to which older individuals are seen as culpable for their problems. If older kin are perceived to be at fault for their problems, are they seen as less deserving of help than if they are not to blame? Do judgments about being at fault for problems affect beliefs about helping parents differently than beliefs about helping stepparents? A random national sample of 229 men and 274 women responded to vignettes about an older parent or stepparent who needed help managing diabetes, which was presented as either the consequence of the older adult's actions or as an inherited illness. Respondents were asked about younger family members' obligations to help older adults, how much help younger adults and public agencies should provide, and how much older adults were responsible for themselves. The effects of older adults' marital status and sex of both adults also were examined. Obligations to stepparents were less than obligations to parents. The amount of help respondents thought should be provided was moderated by older adults' marital status. Obligations and aid to parents and stepparents generally were not affected by the older adults' culpability for the problems.",

Compared to matched control dyads, disabled children were passive and lacking in assertiveness, while their siblings were correspondingly more directive. Interaction in disabled dyads was predominantly hierarchical in nature with disabled children assuming the role of the younger child regardless of age or birth order. Control dyads were more egalitarian, with members taking turns in initiating the interaction. Maternal intervention was higher in disabled dyads, particularly among younger groups where social skills were poorly developed.",

Despite widespread belief that contact with the birth family is beneficial for children and young people in care, this aspect of children's care experience has not received a great deal of attention. In this article I review the literature and draw on research I have undertaken to explore the views of children and young people in care, foster parents, and social work practitioners. The complexity of belonging to more than one family is discussed and tensions in relation to contact with the birth family are identified. It becomes clear that each situation is unique and that there is no \"rule of thumb\" that can be applied. Five key variables are identified: child or young person's developmental stage and history; child or young person's views and wishes; type of placement and future goals; cultural factors; and work with birth families. Practice guidelines in relation to these are developed in the final section.",

      "abstract": "After one's family, the workplace stands at the center of most adults' lives. We spend half our waking hours each day in the presence of others with whom we share a tangle of social relationships. Just as one cannot choose one's family, most of us have no control over who our supervisors or our coworkers are. Nonetheless, we are expected to maintain harmonious relationships with others, even with those who may be competitors for advancement or resources. In other cases, we attempt to foster closer relationships with coworkers we happen to like. It is also the case that relationships between employees can change as their institutional roles change. The workplace, therefore, can be characterized as a complex social milieu in which actors pursue a multitude of diverse agendas, and even innocent or well-meaning statements may be scrutinized by their recipients for subtext or multiple messages. These issues are exacerbated in computer-mediated communication (e.g., e-mail and social media), which typically lacks the contextual cues of face-to-face interaction. Given all of this, it is easy to see how workplace communication can lead to miscommunication.",

Poverty during childhood means a bad start to life and often has long-term effects on an adolescent's social and health development. Health problems are more frequent among preschool-age children from socially disadvantaged families. They are also more often affected by accidents and dental problems. In adolescence, links can be established between the social situation and psychosocial well-being, pain incidence and health behaviour. However, poverty does not inevitably go hand-in-hand with health problems. A stable and supporting social environment -- particularly in families, peer groups and schools -- promotes the development of a positive self-image and social skills, thus empowering the child to deal with demanding living conditions. Measures of social and health policy aimed at lessening the effects of poverty on health must start here.",

In addition, about 350,000 children live with foster families in this country during any given year. These children and their families have inherent vulnerabilities and problems that pediatricians may overlook. Significant numbers of foster children and adoptees are seen with behavioral, learning, and psychiatric problems. It is important that continuing counseling be available to the adoptive family, commencing prior to the adoption procedure and following throughout the early adulthood of the adoptee. ADOPTION Uniqueness of Adoptio Adoption is a situation with emotions which can be best comprehended by those in the adoptive triad itself: the birth-parents, the adoptee, and the adoptive-parents. In the adoptive procedure a mother has given up a child she has borne; parents adopt the child of an unfamiliar background, and, unlike his peers, the child knows that he was not born to the parents who have reared him. Many adoption agencies have in the past advised the adoptive-parents to raise the child as their own, love him as their own, and concurrently remind him periodically that he is not their own! Frequently no further counseling would be suggested for these families.",

An in-depth understanding of fetal and neonatal physiology and the molecular basis of pathological processes, concurrent with advancements in biomedical technology, have impacted favorably upon the survival of the newborn. However, extremely premature infants at the threshold of viability, infants diagnosed with potentially lethal congenital malformations, including chromosomal abnormalities, and neonates suffering from profound intrapartum and postnatal insults present difficult moral, ethical, cultural and social challenges for both families and caregivers in regard to providing or withholding life supportive measures. The decision to withhold or terminate treatment for an infant is based on defining the issues central to this process, including: the values and rights of the infant as an individual, the values of the family and the medical caregivers and the cultural influences and societal values that shape the moral arguments that affect one's judgment. Part of the challenge resides in the complexity of defining who is or should be responsible for making difficult decisions resulting in the death of a newborn since fundamentally this type of decision is at odds with human nature even in situations where the end of life would mean no further suffering for the infant.",

One can devote much of their life to helping others, or live selfishly and prioritize their personal interests. Social interaction in any society is influenced by the psychological, social, and political conditions that the society experiences. The more a climate of warmth, empathy, and stability prevails, the more positive the relationships between individuals will be, and the opposite leads to negative relationships. Today, our Iraqi society needs social cohesion and positive relationships between its members more than ever, due to the unjust economic blockade that the country suffers from, which has led to negative behavior and attitudes among its youth. Ethics are the guardian of the individual and the foundation of a civilized society. It is not enough for the teacher to guide individuals on virtues, as a good education requires a long process of continuous commitment, and depends largely on a good family environment. The current research aims to identify the aspects of social interaction among preschool children and to clarify the importance of social interaction. Children begin interacting from the earliest days of their lives, and this interaction grows until the preschool stage, where they acquire the ability to communicate effectively.",

      "abstract": "Aims: This symposium will explore diverse health-related social co-regulation processes a) by concentrating on contexts where they occur, i.e., couples and close others; b) by addressing - yet also going beyond social support and taking up less-well understood co-regulation processes such as transmission, social control, and dyadic planning; c) by investigating distal and proximal health-related criteria including health behaviour, physiological outcomes, or mortality; and d) by investigating subjectively as well as objectively assessed outcome indicators. \nRationale: To better understand the well-established link between social embeddedness and survival, it is important to recognise the diversity of potential connecting pathways. We hold that social co-regulation of health should be studied where it occurs, i.e., within the social context; that different means of how persons interact to regulate each other’s health should be addressed; and that different types of proximal health-related outcomes should be taken into account, while making an effort to capture them in meaningful and possibly unbiased ways. \nSummary: Gawrilow and colleagues present insights into relations between daily received social support from friends and family and physical activity in young adults. Stadler and colleagues investigate how caregiver support processes are linked with survival in blood and lymphoid cancer patients after transplant. Ditzen and colleagues focus on positive and negative co-regulation mechanisms of couples’ intertwined physiological stress parameters in daily life. Scholz and Berli address social control and Knoll and colleagues investigate dyadic planning as spousal co-regulation strategies to enhance daily physical activity. Finally, Revenson will discuss findings and suggest future directions for the investigation of links between social co-regulation and health.",

      "abstract": "Door grote veranderingen die in onze wereld plaatsvinden moeten dieren en mensen hun gedrag aanpassen aan onbekende situaties. Het succes hiervan hangt af van zowel de gebeurtenis als van het individu. De ontwikkeling van gedrag wordt sterk beinvloed door de vroege omgeving. Belangrijke ontwikkelingsprocessen zijn ouderlijke effecten, imprinting en sociaal leren, maar deze zijn kwetsbaar voor onvoldoende of schadelijke invloeden vooral vanuit de habitat, ouders, voeding en sociale omgeving. Een studie met stekelbaarzen liet zien dat kleine verschillen tijdens de vroege omgeving al kunnen leiden tot aantoonbare verschillen in coping gedrag, zoals exploratie en sociaal- en neurotisch gedrag. Een vervolgstudie gaf aan dat het soort omgeving dat dieren ervaren tijdens hun ontwikkeling, huisvesting en experimenten van grote invloed op het coping gedrag is. Dit kan een probleem zijn voor onderzoek naar diergedrag. Ook menselijk gedrag werd bestudeerd, om oorzaak en gevolg van intergenerationele transmissie van coping gedrag – het lijken op je ouders in persoonlijkheid – beter te begrijpen. Vaderlijke afwijzing op elfjarige leeftijd was gerelateerd aan minder gelijkenis met beide ouders op zestienjarige leeftijd. Jongeren die toen meer op hun ouders leken, ervaarden in het algemeen meer welzijn en minder depressieve symptomen op negentienjarige leeftijd. Ouderlijke depressie had geen effect op dit verband. Hoewel sommige effecten van de vroege omgeving omkeerbaar zijn, is dit niet altijd het geval. Zowel dieren als mensen blijken niet helemaal vrij om zich op de meest adaptieve manier te ontwikkelen: de beschikbare opties worden beinvloed dor de condities die tijdens het vroege leven ervaren werden.",

      "abstract": "The concept of resilience as relative good outcome despite the experience of situations that have been shown to carry a major risk for the development of psychopathology” (Rutter, 2000), is currently significant regarding children living in vulnerable families, or children who suffered the trauma of being removed from their families for a defined period of life (foster care or residential care) or definitively (adoption). \r\nUnderstanding protective factors is of utmost importance for educators and social workers, whose professional goal is supporting and fostering identity development and construction processes within different contexts of education: parents within family, teachers in schools and social workers in the local community.\r\nAdopting the less common perspective of “learning from the Holocaust” and not the most ordinary of “studying and teaching the Holocaust”, the analysis of life stories of resilient Holocaust child survivors (aspects of life before and after Holocaust such as parental style, social networks, peer relationship, community, school, formal-informal help, ecological system) can become a very favourable research context to enhance educational knowledge on constitutional process of human development. \r\nThe project aimed to longitudinally study life trajectory of Holocaust child survivors (particularly Hidden Children) in order to learn from them and to identify protective factors that enabled them to develop and grow and that can be used by social care practitioners working with vulnerable children and families, in order to foster similar resilience responses among children currently in out-of home-care,\r\nThe hypotheses guiding the project claimed that:\r\n-\tsocial work establishment can learn valuable lessons from life stories of hidden child survivors of the Holocaust who developed resilience;\r\n-\tunderstanding of protective factors in human development can be improved through the long term analysis of life stories of resilient individuals and can allow us to grasp the knowledge of those elements that can foster resilience in children in out-of-home care;\r\n-\tthere are aspects (axiological, behavioral, relational, cognitive, social, affective) belonging to Jewish culture, that could contribute to foster the survivors’ ability to arise, rebuild their lives and resist traumatic events;\r\n-\tthere are some links between the experiences of hidden child survivors and children nowadays out of home - although we are aware of the singularity of the different experiences.\r\nSince we were interested on subjective perspective of individual and her or his subjective truth the research has been carried out along the lines of qualitative approach and particularly on narrative research with Holocaust survivors. Research results do not aim to be generalized in a statistical way, on the contrary, they will be used to enhance social work knowledge by in-depth meeting with individuals’ biographies. \r\nThe units of study consisted in textual narrative material collected through 19 semi-structured in depth interviews with resilient survivors – mostly hidden children, 1 child refugee and 3 child deportees (collected at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington D.C., Yad Vashem, Jerusalem, and in Italy) and 2 published biographies.\r\nThe interviews lasted 1 hour and a half on average and transcription is about 10 single spaced sheets each interview. Textual data collected have been codified analyzed through handmade and software (Atlas.ti, www.atlasti.com) content analysis.\r\nThe results give interesting reflection on social work with children out-of-home, particularly about the topic of multiple belonging and attachments, and the issue of helping child to integrate his/her different identities into a single unique story.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020), a person is considered a teenager in the age range of 10-19 years who is experiencing physical, emotional and social changes and is susceptible to mental health problems due to exposure to poverty, abuse and violent behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the emotional development of children who are starting to grow into teenagers. Adolescents who have detrimental social interaction skills find it difficult to establish friendships and prefer to be alone, like to be hostile, angry, withdrawn, and tend not to have many friends. These problems can disrupt friendships between people and can result in a separate groups into individuals. This problem must also be resolved immediately, otherwise we will definitely be the ones who suffer. Another problem that arises is when we want to get rid of a toxic friend, sometimes we feel sorry for those who used to do everything with us, but are now separated, which makes them lonely. However, if we choose to continue our friendship with someone who is toxic, it will be our party who suffers, both mentally and physically. The research objectives of this study are 1). To find out what causes toxic friendship. 2). To find out what impacts arise from toxic friendship. 3). To find out how to overcome toxic friendship behavior. The approach used by researchers is a qualitative approach with a descriptive method that is flexible, flexible and open, and focuses more on describing the toxic phenomenon that is the focus of the research, and in its implementation, data and theory are explored as deeply as possible so that the findings can be described in full, In this research, researchers also used the Mils &amp; Hubberman method, the activities were data reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. Data Reduction is conducting research in the field by observing the behavior of teenagers affected by toxic friendship. conducted in-depth interviews with teenage members of the Qutbu Karomatul Atkiya Mosque. Based on research conducted by conducting interviews with several informants who had the required criteria, the results of this research will explain the impact of toxic friendship on teenagers at the Qutbu Karomatul Atkiya Mosque, focusing on several indicators. namely insecurity, depression and low self-confidence. Based on the results of interviews with the subjects, it was stated that Alvin, Reza and Janu were victims of toxic friendship who were affected by several impacts from their own friends.",

      "title": "Children and parental divorce: The meaning of small effects — A reply",
      "abstract": "AbstractAbstractThe commentary on my earlier review of Australian studies of parental divorce raises a number of important points. One of these is the evaluation of strength of association. I argue that the effect sizes found for the association between parental divorce and several social and psychological outcomes have been understated and can be shown to be equal to those of other important early-life and contemporary risk factors for mental health problems. A second issue is the research direction required to establish those factors which mediate or moderate the impact of parental separation for children. I suggest that the following questions need to be addressed: (a) What factors operating in childhood ameliorate or exacerbate the social and psychological problems associated with parental divorce? (b) What behavioural signs identify those children who develop long-term problems? (c) What circumstances in adolescence and adulthood operate as risk and protective factors for the onset and persistence of adult difficulties?",

Typically, parents are more forward-looking than their children and, hence, care about investments in human capital to a larger extent. In this paper we consider the parent-child health-related interaction, when the parent is altruistic and forward-looking and the child is egoistic and short-sighted. The child receives a monetary transfer, from the parent, which is used to finance either health-unrelated consumption or unhealthy behaviour. We apply a simple differential-game approach, assuming linear-state preferences, and study equilibrium time-paths of (a) the parental transfer, (b) the unhealthy behaviour, and (c) the stock of child health capital. We distinguish between the case in which the child is perfectly myopic and the case in which he or she is forward looking.",

      "abstract": "Normative, widely circulated discourses about the value of outdoor, natural play for children overwhelmingly marginalize the experiences of families with disabled children, who can often experience outdoor/natural play as a site of hard work, heartache, dread, resignation and inadequacy. This paper presents findings from research with 60 North London families with children aged 5–16 who have a statutory 'Statement of Special Needs'. Focusing on these families' experiences of visiting designated, newly refurbished accessible natural play-spaces in two local country parks, the paper highlights: (i) the multiple, compound social-material 'barriers to fun' encountered in these spaces; (ii) the profound emotional-affective impacts of such barriers, most notably in terms of feelings of 'resignation' and 'dread'; (iii) parents'/carers' sadness occasioned by perceived 'failures' to 'live up to' normative ideals of parenting and family engagement with outdoor play and urban natures; (iv) nevertheless, the possibility of moments of family joy, love and 'special' time, afforded via families' 'hard work' and 'keeping going through hard times'. Through an engagement with recent conceptualizations of everyday geographies of disabilities, the paper suggests that these qualitative experiences complicate some chief, normative ways of knowing outdoor play, urban natures and barriers to accessibility.",

We used qualitative content analysis to explore how contemporary Canadian and American films depicted coresiding young adults and their similarly aged, residentially independent siblings with respect to various markers of adulthood. We found that coresiding characters were largely portrayed as developmentally immature both socially (e.g., full-time work) and characterologically (e.g., relational competence). In contrast, residentially independent siblings were overwhelmingly cast as developmentally on time. We argue that these depictions and contrasts reinforce a stigmatized coresider trope, framing the traits and actions of coresiders in terms of atypical development and attributing this living arrangement to individual faults. Implications for social attitudes and the wellbeing of emerging adults are discussed.",

Sauer, 1979; Peters, 1988]. Formerly, the main issue was living together in groups, self-determination, and destigmatizing life in a home; more recently, since the amendments of the new law on the protection of youth (KJHG) that came into force in 1991, the emphasis has been not so much the child's well-being or the right of young people to self-determination as the family in need. Accordingly, the alternative of growing up in a home became less a sanction or a dramatic termination of a family gone wrong than one of a wide range of options offered from counseling and social-welfare group work to social-pedagogical aid to families.",

Históricamente las familias adoptivas han tenido poca visibilidad social, debido a que esta condición tiene un matiz de abandono, que, en aras de proteger al niño o niña que la vive, se intenta ocultar, negar o restar importancia. Sin embargo, la separación –que puede ser dramática- y la posible institucionalización pueden generar traumas que requieran atención psicológica, médica y educativa especializada. Los profesionales de la salud mental deben contemplar a la triada de la adopción, compuesta por la familia biológica, la creatura y la familia adoptiva e implica retos en cada una de sus aristas. La madre biológica tiene una importante presencia en el acto de cesión, lo cual puede implicar desde desinterés hasta un profundo dolor. Los padres adoptivos, regularmente viven un diagnóstico de infertilidad, con su consecuente dolor emocional y si no viven un proceso de duelo, podrán cuidar y querer a la creatura, mas no hijarla, es decir, generar vínculos emocionales sanos con él o ella, debido a no haber renunciado al hijo biológico. También deben saber responder a las preguntas que el hijo o hija haga a diferentes edades, ya que es el personaje principal en esta triada y necesita contar con personas preparadas, -familia, docentes, profesionales de la salud- para acompañarle en la asunción de su adopción y en la búsqueda de sus orígenes, lo cual si bien es un derecho para toda persona, en su caso está sujeto a la preparación emocional de sus nuevos padres. Cada elemento de la triada tiene necesidades y derechos que la sociedad necesita conocer a través de información científica y ética que permita su visibilización como una forma válida de ser familia.",

Some species provide no care past fertilization; others have male‐only care, female‐only care, biparental care, or cooperative care; within‐species flexibility can also be observed. Care patterns are evolutionary outcomes that feature multiple types of conflict over parental investment. The recipient benefits if it receives more care; however, if the parent or alloparent saves some of the effort, its current or future fitness may be improved at the expense of the offspring. In addition to parent–offspring conflict, there is also conflict between potential caregivers. The diversity of care patterns in nonhuman primates and humans can in principle be analyzed with the same set of conceptual tools as for other animals. In humans, two aspects stand out as being relatively unique: first, the role of grandmothers that associates with the evolution of menopause; and, second, the demographic transition featuring increasing investment per child.",

Emerging adults had to make quick decisions about where and with whom to shelter in place. In this grounded theory study, we explored how 22 young adults, predominantly living in the United States, navigated relationship decisions during the pandemic. The results suggest that participants were intentional about their choices, particularly in terms of moving in together (or not). The pandemic sometimes changed the timing of cohabitation or the pace of dating relationships; however, these decisions unfolded in tandem with common developmental tasks, such as college graduation and launching a career. More broadly, our findings suggest that participants’ responses to the pandemic both reflected core aspects of emerging adulthood (e.g., instability, feeling in-between) and also challenged them (e.g., other focus, limited exploration).",

Le QD, considéré comme un marqueur fiable de risque pour le développement de l’enfant, est abaissé de manière significative dans les familles les plus désorganisées. Dans les familles moins désorganisées, c’est essentiellement le QD sociabilité qui est inférieur à celui des autres groupes témoins (enfants élevés en pouponnière, en crèche, et dans des familles normales). Par ailleurs, les dysfonctionnements les plus fréquemment rencontrés dans le groupe familial ont été un holding , un handling et une présentation de l’objet inadéquats, une imprévisibilité parentale, un environnement désorganisé ou envahi, une identification des parents à l’observateur avec un risque de forçage, et un manque d’intimité avec une absence de pare-excitation. Les visites à domicile apparaissent comme un outil indispensable pour travailler avec les familles en grande difficulté éducative.",

The relationships between residents and caregivers in long-term care facilities may develop into relationships that are more typically familial than professional. With these emerging family-like relationships, the interpersonal pattern interactions may be healthy or unhealthy and may create opportunities for growth or pathology-producing patterns. This article illustrates how applying Peplau's concept of need-pattern integrations in the long-term care setting has the potential to enhance understanding, and subsequently guide interactions, between younger residents and caregivers. The potential is greatest when interactions are guided.",

An understanding of development during middle age helps put into perspective the mystifying and unusual behavior shown by a minority of middle-aged adults. Levinson delineates alternating phases of structure-building periods (six to eight years) with transitional upheavals of four to five years' duration. The latter includes one in the early 40s and again in the 50s. Vaillant emphasizes a career consolidation stage between Erikson's young adulthood (intimacy) and the generativity stage of the 50s. This consolidation stage corresponds in many ways to Levinson's transitional stage of the 40s. Vaillant also makes the point that maturity in midlife is reflected by the changes in the use of more mature adaptive mechanisms (corresponding somewhat to Hamburg's coping behavior) as the adult moves toward the 60s. Development tasks during middle age include adjusting to bodily changes; achieving career goals; readjusting to the marital dyad, adult children, and aging parents; and planning for security in old age.",

The avant garde and countercultural families combined the strongest sex egalitarian beliefs, with commitment to a proactive, questioning orientation toward society, and relative stability in family life-style choice. Children in the avant garde and countercultural families also displayed non-sex-typed knowledge of objects and occupations more often than did children in the other families, but all children showed knowledge of sex-typed schemas as well. Only scattered differences were found on other measures of children's sex-typed preferences or in sex-typed behavior. The form of the family or domestic unit (single parent, married couple, unmarried couple, or commune) was not related to sex typing, and socioeconomic measures had little effect, compared to nonconventional family types. Girls had more flexible sex-typing training and displayed non-sex-typed schemas more than boys across family types, conventional and nonconventional alike.",

      "title": "Supporting aspects and problems of having pets and implications for nursing: A descriptive study",
      "abstract": "Pet ownership by elderly people is very common. This phenomenological study investigated why elderly people keep pets and what illness of the animals or their loss means to them. Nine women and three men owning either cats, dogs, or birds participated in this study. Their average age was 84. The results confirm on the one hand that elderly people experience happiness and joy thanks to having pets, giving them an ingenious social function as well as helping overcome the frequent passivity of old age. The problems arising with the ownership of animals are accident endangering (falls) and overexertion. An additional concern is the support of the animals during illness of the owner. The loss of animals is often connected with serious grief reaction and disorganisation of daily life. Serious, long-lasting, and pathological grief reactions were shown after a forced separation from the pet. Four recommendations for nursing practice resulted from this study: to approve and support the ownership of pets and domestic animals as a factor of the \"good old age\"; to accept the pets as part of the 'family' and integrate them into nursing work, to encourage the owner to plan the future of the pet. Finally, to help overcome the loss of pets and animals a specific nursing therapeutic treatment is required.",

      "abstract": "Guided by family systems theory, we focused on families where young children have experienced paternal incarceration (n = 775 families). We examined how characteristics of mothers and fathers at two levels of the family system–individual (i.e., depression) and relational (i.e., support/affection, constructive conflict, destructive conflict, and coparenting)—were associated with internalizing and externalizing child behavior problems in a sample of families with fathers who had been previously incarcerated. Using path analysis, we found a positive association between paternal depressive symptoms and child internalizing behaviors, as well as a positive association between maternal and paternal destructive conflict and children's internalizing and externalizing child behaviors. Other relational characteristics, including support and affection, constructive conflict and coparenting alliance were not significantly related to children's behavior problems. Interventions that target families with children of previously incarcerated fathers should support parents as individuals and as couples to benefit the entire family system by reducing child behavior problems.",

As a result of analysis by utilizing Q methodology, stress recognition type of adoptive families was confirmed to be 4 types including ‘a type of feeling burden for new family formation(type 1)’, ‘a type of lacking psychosocial support(type 2)``, ‘a type of being subsided by prejudiced social recognition(type 3)``, and ‘a type of being tension by internalized confidentiality(type 4)``. Type 1 is characterized by having biological children or infertility and open adoption, and adoptive families recognized a strong stress in terms of parent`s role or responsibility, lack of support or support system of governmental or social, and attention of the people who cast special eyes on adoptive families. Type 2 is characterized by infertility and open adoption, and adoptive families recognized a strong stress in inadequate of governmental policy or system, lack of social support system and concern about the situation or behavior to be experienced by child through adoption. Type 3 is characterized by secret adoption even under infertility, and adoptive families recognized a strong stress in social discrimination or prejudice for the adoption. Type 4 is characterized by infertility or secondary infertility and limited open adoption, and adoptive families recognized a strong stress for fear of adoptive truth being known to the child and having to endure traumatic and hard process by the child who got to know adoptive truth. Based on above analysis result, the implication for social welfare required for pursuing a stabilized and successful adaptation of adoptive families were suggested.",

      "title": "Millennials and Their Parents: Implications of the New Young Adulthood for Midlife Adults",
      "abstract": "Abstract The period of young adulthood has transformed dramatically over the past few decades. Today, scholars refer to “emerging adulthood” and “transitions to adulthood” to describe adults in their 20s. Prolonged youth has brought concomitant prolonged parenthood. This article addresses 3 areas of change in parent/child ties, increased (a) contact between generations, (b) support from parents to grown children as well as coresidence and (c) affection between the generations. We apply the Multidimensional Intergenerational Support Model (MISM) to explain these changes, considering societal (e.g., economic, technological), cultural, family demographic (e.g., fertility, stepparenting), relationship, and psychological (normative beliefs, affection) factors. Several theoretical perspectives (e.g., life course theory, family systems theory) suggest that these changes may have implications for the midlife parents’ well-being. For example, parents may incur deleterious effects from (a) grown children’s problems or (b) their own normative beliefs that offspring should be independent. Parents may benefit via opportunities for generativity with young adult offspring. Furthermore, current patterns may affect future parental aging. As parents incur declines of late life, they may be able to turn to caregivers with whom they have intimate bonds. Alternately, parents may be less able to obtain such care due to demographic changes involving grown children raising their own children later or who have never fully launched. It is important to consider shifts in the nature of young adulthood to prepare for midlife parents’ future aging.",

Children born prematurely show characteristics that, in a circular process, influence interaction. Bonding disorders are more frequent among former premature infants and make first separations difficult. Parental traumatic experience may lead to over-protection and over-investment mechanisms that can damage the process of separation and individuation in the child. Disorders (psychomotor instability, behavioural problems...) may then appear in these children during the first socializations (day-nursery, pre-school). These disorders can cause a resurgence of the traumatic experience in the parents.In the clinical practice, these mechanisms are observed.

These family members constitute an intergenerational triad, displaying a variety of relationship patterns based on emotional closeness or distance. The most common configuration in three-generation families was all-three inter-generational members emotionally close or connected, and comments about relationships reflected problem solving, communication, and emotional management. Families in which the parent was close to and linked both adjacent generations were also frequent, and comments showed a clear parenting hierarchy with grandmother as secondary. Few families had weak, disconnected relationships between all three triad members or an emotionally isolated parent: These patterns were related to low grandmother and grandchild well-being.

Verschiedene Theorieansatze werden in der vorliegenden Studie vergleichen im Rahmen eines komplexen Erklarungsmodells analysiert. Empirische Grundlage sind Daten einer Eltern-Kind-Befragung (N=457), die 1997 in drei deutschen Stadten durchgefuhrt wurde. Im Fokus des Interesses steht die Erklarung fremdenfeindlicher Einstellungen. Die Ergebnisse belegen einen dominanten Effekt direkter Transmissionsprozesse fur die Ausbildung fremdenfeindlicher Einstellungen von Jugendlichen. Gewalttatige Verhaltensweise, die vergleichend analysiert wurden, werden hingegen starker durch die Interaktionsstrukturen innerhalb der Familie erklart. (DIPF/Orig.)\nThe following study analyses different influences on the development of political socialisation. Often the family is seen as a decisive factor. According to different models of transmission, the early childhood or the adolescence are the formative phases for the development of political attitudes. One could distinguish direct and indirect transmission models. One can find also models that see not in the family, but in societal developments decisive factors that mobilize the development of specific political orientations. The following study compares the explanative power of different theoretical models. Empirical basis are data from a questionnaire study of parents and their children conducted in 1997 in three German cities. Focus of interest is the explanation of xenophobic attitudes. The results confirm a dominant effect of direct transmission processes for the development of xenophobic attitudes. In contrast indirect effect of interaction modes in the family have a decisive effect on deviant behaviour. (DIPF/Orig.)",

      "title": "Family violence: Walking the tight rope between maternal alienation and child safety",
      "abstract": "AbstractMothers are often alienated from their children when child abuse is suspected or confirmed, whether she is the primary abuser of the child or not. An abusive or violent partner often initiates the process of maternal alienation from children as a control mechanism. When the co-occurrence of maternal and child abuse is not recognised, nurses and health professionals risk further alienating a mother from her child/ren, which can have detrimental effects in both the short and long term. Evidence shows that when mothers are supported and have the necessary resources there is a reduction in the violence and abuse she and her children experience; this occurs even in situations where the mother is the primary abuser of her children. The family-centred care philosophy, which is widely accepted as the best approach to nursing care for children and their families, creates tension for nurses caring for children who are the victims of abuse as this care generally occurs away from the context of the family. This fragmented approach to caring for abused children can inadvertently undermine the mother-child relationship and further contribute to maternal alienation. This paper discusses the complexity of family violence for nurses negotiating the 'tight rope' between the prime concern for the safety of children and further contributing to maternal alienation, within a New Zealand context. The premise that restoration of the mother–child relationship is paramount for the long-term wellbeing of both the child/ren and the mother provides the basis for discussing implications for nursing practice.Key Words: maternal alienationchild abusefamily violenceco-occurrence of maternal & child abuse",

      "abstract": "This study addressed the potential impact of serial migration for parent-children relationships and for children's psychological well-being. The experience of being separated from their parents during childhood and reunited with them at a later time was retrospectively examined for 48 individuals. A series of measures (e.g., self-esteem, parental identification) associated with appraisals at critical time periods during serial migration (separation, reunion, current) revealed that serial migration can potentially disrupt parent-child bonding and unfavorably affect children's self-esteem and behavior. Time did not appear to be wholly effective in repairing rifts in the parent-child relationship. Risk factors for less successful reunions included lengthy separations and the addition of new members to the family unit in the child's absence.",

En ella, los hijos estan preocupados en censurar, criticar y rechazar a uno de sus progenitores, descalificacion que es injustificada y/o exagerada. Otras manifestaciones sintomaticas del sindrome son: justificaciones para el desprecio debiles y absurdas, ausencia de ambivalencia, los menores no muestran sentimientos encontrados, presencia de argumentos prestados …\r\n entre otras.\r\nEn este trabajo se analizan 3 casos de familias inmersas en Sindrome de Alienacion Parental, procedentes del Punto de Encuentro Familiar de la Cruz Roja de Castellon, y que en su mayoria fueron finalmente derivados a servicios de mediacion.

      "title": "Can we help older adults to feel at home in a residential care facility? What we can learn from health care personnel",
      "abstract": "Most older adults wish to age in place—living, and ultimately dying, in their own home. However, at some point, some older adults need to move to a residential care facility (RCF), such as a nursing home or an assisted living facility, due to the worsening of their physical and/or cognitive conditions, the loss of family relationships, or the inability of their family members to take care of them. Moving to an RCF is a critical moment in an older adult's life, as it separates them from significant people and objects in their life, disrupts their habits, and breaks their connection with their local community. These changes can negatively affect the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being of older adults if they fail to create a new home in the novel environment.1 For older adults, feeling a sense of being \"at home\" is a multifactorial phenomenon influenced by several psychological, social, and built-environmental aspects.2 Health care personnel who provide care in RCFs, and the directors and managers responsible for organization of care and resource allocation, have an important role in fostering the sense of \"home\" for older adults residing in RCFs, as highlighted by the qualitative systematic review published in this issue of JBI Evidence Synthesis.3 This review synthesized the evidence derived from 7 qualitative studies from Europe and North America that explored the experiences of health care personnel in promoting a sense of home for older adults in RCFs using a meta-aggregative approach, which is the method endorsed by JBI for qualitative synthesis. This approach enables the creation of generalizable statements in the form of recommendations to guide practitioners and policy-makers.4 We learned from this review that physical factors (eg, building structure, design), work organizational features, and care culture of the RCFs, as well as national, regional, and local regulations, can influence the creation of a sense of home in older adults residing in these settings.3 If we want to make older adults feel at home in a care facility, we must create a home-like environment and not a hospital-like environment. This involves offering large, private rooms with en-suite bathrooms for each resident and common areas that resemble domestic spaces, such as private or common kitchens, television lounges, sitting rooms, dining rooms, and accessible outdoor spaces. We should allow older residents to bring furniture or other personal artefacts to foster familiarity with the place and continuity of life. These environmental standards should be included in national and local regulations and guidelines, along with safety standards to guarantee that the creation of a sense of home is assured in all RCFs. Moreover, we should replace a hospital-like work model with a home-like work model, which includes flexible organization of daily activities that respects residents' autonomy, freedom of choice, and personal habits. Participation in domestic and recreational activities should be promoted according to residents' preferences to make them feel like active members of the facility community. The maintenance of meaningful, reciprocal relationships between residents and family members, staff, and other residents creates a sense of familiarity and belonging to a larger community. We should embrace a person-centered rather than a patient-centered care model in RCFs. Residents should not be thought of as sick patients requiring medical care and assistance, but as persons with wishes and the potentiality of further growth who want to live a meaningful life, regardless of physical or cognitive impairments. If we want to make older adult residents feel at home in RCFs, we must not only provide a shelter, but we must listen to the experiences of health care personnel and help create an ambience that promotes meaningful relationships, a sense of purpose, and a fulfilling community. This review3 presents the available evidence on the sentiments of health care personnel regarding older people aging in RCFs. Although the level of confidence in the findings was classified as low due to dependability and credibility issues, evidence from this review seemingly reflects many of our own views about getting older and living our best lives, and supports a realistic and empathic way forward.",

The present study examined the possibilities that (a) lower levels of cohesion and adaptability may be optimal for remarried families, (b) cohesion and adaptability may be less important for coping and stress in stepfamilies than in first married families, and (c) patterns of relationships between the two sets of variables may be different for the two family types. A series of analyses relating cohesion and adaptability to family stress and coping styles revealed that high levels of family cohesion and adaptability are equally if not more important for stepfamilies as they are for biological families in reference to family stress and coping.",

Attitudes of 1,009 randomly selected participants were elicited using a vignette that portrayed a situation adult (step)children experience in post-divorce families. Findings suggest that, (a) adult children are obligated to help their divorced parents, (b) kinship is not a sufficient reason for most people to attribute obligations to adult children, although familial obligation is the most frequently offered rationale for helping divorced parents, (c) adult stepchildren are perceived to be responsible to help their stepparents, (d) there is consensus regarding the type of help that should and should not be given by (step)children to (step)parents, (e) adult (step) children are not perceived to be obligated to provide physicalcaregiving for (step)parents, (f) relationship quality is an important criterion for attributing responsibilities to stepchildren, and (g) older adults differ from younger adults in their beliefs about intergenerational obligations.

When parents are unable to carry on with the immediate care of the child, the kinship network often steps in quite naturally and without any involvement from social workers or the State. In 1989, the new Children Young Persons and their Families Act in New Zealand placed the primary responsibility for children in crisis with their kinship network; family conferences would be called, and the people within the child's network would be asked to decide upon the best course of action. In societies where the State has little role to play, there may still be disputes within the kinship network about who knows the child's needs best, or who within the extended family group should actually be caring for the child.",

The cause of the disorder is the psychological characteristics of the child, emotional stress caused by the need for constant child care. The fact that a child is born «not like everyone else» is the cause of severe stress experienced by parents, primarily the mother. Mothers often experience hysterics and depression. The fears that overcome women about their unborn child give rise to feelings of loneliness, loss and a feeling of «the end of life.» Mothers are with their children constantly. Often, such mothers are characterized by a decrease in mental tone and low self-esteem, which manifests itself in a loss of taste for life, professional career prospects, and the inability to realize their own creative plans. The authors, studying the factors influencing the formation of psychoemotional characteristics of parents, in particular mothers raising children with special needs, identified some problems in the formation of their psycho-emotional state: special stereotypical attitudes towards children with special needs and their mothers in families; problems of inter-spousal relations and distribution of responsibilities between them; problems of child upbringing and socialization.",

The similar pattern of response in this group of children suggests a biologically determined cause.

The majority of the mothers did not understand this natural phenomenon and regarded the clinging and crying of the 1-year-old as evidence of spoiled or regressed behavior. The pediatrician can be helpful to a mother by anticipating and explaining separation responses, by indicating their universality, and by giving specific recommendations for gradual changes to modify these reactions.",

      "abstract": "The long (and hard) way to adulthood of the Italian youth ABSTRACT: All the western societies are currently facing an important process of demographic and social transformation, typically indicated as Second Demographic Transition. This process is characterized from important changes in the sexual and contraception spheres, from radical modifications (both quantitative and qualitative) of the family structures, from an emphasized marriages instability, from a marked reduction of the birth rate and, above all, from a redefinition of all the social times related to the formation of the family (average age of exit from the origin nucleus, average age at the wedding, average age at parenthood, etc.). Among the other European countries, Italy maintains some peculiar characters, especially about the great value still recognized to the family and the wedding and the persistence of a strong tie between parents and sons, confirmed by the intergenerational solidarity system which is still very important in the Country and from the living choices done from the young leavers (for instance, the housing proximity) that confirm their will to maintain tight relationships with the family of origin. A deep change in the events’ calendar which define times and ways of entrance, permanence and exit from the various stages of the life cycle is going on in Italy, especially with regard to transition to adulthood, which appears to be more and more postponed and also characterized from remarkable changes in the motivation of the exit from the origin family and in the subsequent family and reproductive intentions of young Italians. In the present contribution we will attempt to analyze characters, times and ways of the long (and difficult) transition to the adult state of the Italian young people, using the informative base represented from the Istat Multipurpose Surveys. For such a purpose there’ll be analyzed, in particular, the motivations of the long permanence and those of exit from the origin nucleus and the young people opinions about some aspects regarding the family.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Millions of families are affected by elder family financial exploitation (EFFE), but the consequences for lifelong intergenerational family relationships and family functioning remain largely unexamined (i.e., parent/child, siblings). This study examines the consequences of experiencing EFFE on the quality of family relationships from the perspective of non-victim, non-perpetrator concerned family members (CFMs). Data from a larger EFFE mixed-methods study were utilized. A voluntary sample of 28 CFMs who had experienced EFFE participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews and brief surveys. Analysis included identifying quality of family relationship themes from data related to differences EFFE has made in their family. Participating CFMs were primarily adult children of older victims, and siblings of the primary perpetrators. The findings reflect three patterns of changes in quality of family relationships between the CFMs and other family members, including: (a) Restoring trust and recovery within the family, (b) Alliances and taking sides, and (c) Estrangement and cutoff. While families were never the same after experiencing the exploitation, for some was a healing process to accept the family situation and restore and repair trust. Redefining who would be family moving forward was a focus for some families when perpetrators and CFMs took sides and formed allies with others. In the most dramatic changes, siblings, parents and others became cutoff and isolated from other family members. While a loss of relationship quality was common, strengthening of relationships also occurred. Understanding EFFE from an ecological family systems perspective can help to inform needed EFFE interventions, both processes and outcomes.",

      "title": "Family-centred care for hospitalized children aged 0-12 Years: A systematic review of qualitative studies",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of the review is to synthesise the existing evidence on family and/or health providers' experience of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children aged 0-12 years (excluding premature neonates). (*Some sections of this protocol are adopted or adapted from the Cochrane Systematic Review of family-centred care in hospitalised children 0-12 years (2007)1 and its update (2012)2 and are published here with permission from Wiley. A more detailed discussion of the development of the concept of family-centred care is available in these publications.) Background Family-centred care is defined as \"a way of caring for children and their families within health services which ensures that care is planned around the whole family, not just the individual child/person, and in which all the family members are recognized as care recipients\".3, p.1318 A number of related terms have been used to describe the attributes of family-centred care;4 these include partnership-in-care,5 parental involvement,6 nurse-parent partnership,3 parental participation,7 and care-by-parent.8,9 Until at least the late 1950s, hospitals worldwide tended to be bleak places for children. It was believed that visits from parents would inhibit effective care10 and were detrimental to the child, who would become distressed when the parents left.11,12 Researchers began to suggest, however, that children whose parents did not visit them suffered acute emotional trauma which may have long-term psychological consequences in adolescence and adulthood.13,14 In 1956, the British government commissioned a report into the welfare of children in hospital. The resulting report, the Platt Report15, recommended that visiting be unrestricted, that mothers stay in hospital with their child, and that training of medical and nursing staff should promote understanding of the emotional needs of children. The process of change has resulted in a humanisation of paediatrics,16,17 although the movement away from traditional approaches to health service delivery to the involvement of families in all aspects of the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care has been slow.18,19 The foundation for a family-centred approach to paediatric health care is the belief that a child's emotional and developmental needs, and overall family wellbeing, are best achieved when the service system supports diligently the ability of the family to meet the needs of their child, by involving families in the plan of care.20–22 Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of Family-Centred Care There are a range of potential benefits and difficulties associated with the provision of family-centred care. One of these is the degree to which the family is seen as responsible for the child's care. In a number of cases family-centred care has been interpreted as care that is led by parents, who are regarded as expert in the care of their child, with the health professional acting as a consultant.6,7 However, in recent years research has indicated that parents feel that they are being made totally responsible for the care of their child and the expectations of them, at least initially, are too great. In Coyne and Cowley's8 words: \"the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction\".p.893 They are much more comfortable working a truly collaborative way with health-care providers.9 The hospitalisation of a child, whether planned or unplanned, is stressful for even the most well-organised and functional family.23 The significant adjustments to both parent and healthcare provider roles when a child is hospitalised may result in understandable levels of stress.24 A number of studies report that the stress levels of parents are reduced by being more informed and involved in caring for their children while in hospital.25 However, on the other hand involvement can lead, at least in the short term, to additional stress or anxiety for both the parents and child. Parents may feel that they are expected to provide input into the care of their child beyond their expectations or capabilities, or are given more information than either the child or the family is ready to hear. Professional communication and the provision of information are key elements in the success or otherwise of family centred care. In their study of parents' information needs in relation to their chronically ill children, Hummelinck and Pollock26 highlighted the double-edged nature of information in these situations; there is a delicate balance between the positive effects and the potentially negative impact i.e. it can increase anxiety. Information was also a theme identified in Ygge's27 study of nurses' perceptions of parental involvement in hospital care. Not only did the nurses indicate that it was important to discuss with the parents what information was important to them at each stage, but that the information provided to them must be the same from all health personnel. Family centred care also requires specifically designed or adapted facilities. Verwey, et al28 found that attending to parent's physical needs was an important component in reducing stress. Ensuring aspects such as comfortable sleeping arrangements, nutritious food and time to relax away from the ward made a family's experience a more positive one. Researchers have also reported challenges when trying to implement changes which would result in meaningful family involvement in the care of their hospitalised child. Healthcare providers have reported a lack of adequate education in relation to understanding and implementing the concept of family-centred care in a practice situation, as well a lack of shared understanding of, and commitment to, family-centred care among all health professionals and families.18, 29–32 Darbyshire7 suggested that family-centred care was a wonderful idea, but difficult to implement effectively. A number of authors agree, questioning family-centred care as a model of care.31,33 and the ethics of continuing a model which is becoming increasingly described as ineffective are under scrutiny.34 Standard Models of Health Care for Children Family-centred care is regarded as different to the 'standard' models of care used in paediatric health services. In the latter, often the healthcare provider plays a major role in assessing and formulating a plan of care, based upon the perceived needs of the child and/or family. In the medical or standard model of health care, the healthcare worker plans care around the child's illness and treatment needs, and the family is generally expected to comply with treatment recommendations.35 Implementation of Family-Centred Care It is expected that the development, implementation and outcomes of family-centred models of care may differ according to the population and setting in which the models are applied. For example, the needs and outcomes for families with a chronic condition who experience long hospital stays may differ from those of families of a previously healthy young child who is admitted for a treatment procedure. Also, older children may have a greater awareness and understanding of the reasons for their hospitalisation. Therefore, models of care may reflect increased participation of the child in their hospital care. However, even if the processes of family-centred care are seen as making a difference and advantageous in their own right, reliable reassurance that they result in more good than harm should be sought. Currently there is limited systematic information on how these principles have underpinned changes in healthcare practice and service delivery when a child is hospitalised, and the effect of family-centred approaches on child and family outcomes and health service delivery.20 Several systematic reviews have been conducted on the effectiveness of family centred care but very few studies have met the inclusion criteria. Consequently no conclusions could be drawn from these reviews. Shields, et al.1 conducted a Cochrane review of the effectiveness of family-centred care including randomised control trials, before and after and cohort studies from 1960 to 2004. An update of the Cochrane review was also undertaken by Shields, et al.2 in 2012 which examined randomised control trials only from 2004 to December 2011. Furthermore, Shields, et al.36 conducted a systematic review of quasi-experimental studies on the topic published between 2004 and December 2011. A literature review by Shields37 on the topic examined qualitative studies published between 1990 and 2004. Eleven research articles were included in the review. Three main themes emerged: role negotiation, parental expectation of participation in their child's care, and issues relating to power and control. The findings revealed that family-centred models of care were influenced by negotiation between staff and families, and roles of both parents and staff within interactions that took place in hospital during a child's admission. Corlett and Twycross38 also reviewed evidence on the negation of parental roles within family-centred care. The results revealed that family participation in their child's care hindered by nurses' lack of communication and limited negotiation. Nurses did not routinely negotiate with parents even though nurses had clear ideas on what nursing care parents could be involved in. In addition, Coyne39 conducted a review of both research and literature from 1993 to 2007 on children's participation at the health service level. It was found that children were rarely involved in decision-making process and their views were rarely sought nor acknowledged. To date, there is no formal systematic review on the qualitative evidence of family-centred models of care. This systematic review aims to examine any qualitative studies from 2004 to December 2012 that address the experiences and /or perceptions related to family-centred care by families and/or health care providers. Inclusion criteria This review will consider studies that include hospitalised children aged 0-12 years (but excluding premature neonates), their family and/or health providers. Definitions: Child/children: throughout this review, the term 'child' or 'children' is used to include all newborn infants, babies and children up to the age of 12 years being cared for in hospital; and all parts of hospitals that provide a service to children. The definitions of childhood can vary, and age limits are arbitrary. For the purpose of this review the National Library of Medicine's medical subject headings were used to define the age cut off of 12 years. However, we have excluded neonates born prematurely and who are patients in a neonatal intensive or special care nursery, as their requirements for family-centred care, and the ethics and philosophies of care around this particular group, are different to those in a ward/unit where full term infants and children are nursed.40 We have excluded studies about adolescents for similar reasons. Families: throughout the review the following definition of the family will be applied: The family is a basic social unit having as its nucleus two or more persons, irrespective of age, in which each of the following conditions are present: the members are related by blood, or marriage, or adoption, or by a contract which is either explicit or implied; the members communicate with each other in terms of defined social roles such as mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt; and they adopt or create and maintain common customs and traditions. This definition has been modified from Nixon's original definition41 to allow for inclusion of significant others who do not usually cohabit with the family. Healthcare providers involved in caring for hospitalised children. For the purposes of the review, a healthcare provider will be used to describe any health professional involved in the care of hospitalised children. Phenomenon of interest The review will consider studies that investigate family and/or health providers' experience of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children. Only studies that provide clear evidence that the family and/or child were actively involved in the planning and/or delivery of health care during the child's hospitalisation will be considered for inclusion. For the purposes of the review, the minimum criteria for active involvement included evidence of collaboration between health carers and the family and/or child in the planning and/or delivery of care as soon as possible after admission or during the preadmission period. The elements of family centred care can be grouped into three clusters as follows:5 Family as a constant Culturally responsive Supporting family individuality. 'Family as a constant' can be evidenced by: Recognising family strengths Parent/professional collaboration Needs-based family support Flexible provision of health care Sharing information with families. Examples of how the family centred care model can be 'culturally responsive' include, but are not confined to, the family receiving culturally competent health care and respect being shown for family diversity. 'Supporting family individuality and need for different types of family support' can be demonstrated by: Respecting family coping methods Providing emotional support Family-to-family support Attending to developmental needs of the child and family. Further details are contained in Appendix I. Exclusions: Facilitating parent-to-parent support studies where there is no clear evidence of collaboration between the family and/or child and health care provider in the planning and/or delivery of care will be excluded. Such studies would include parental presence during health care procedures such as routine examinations, anaesthetic induction, venepuncture and post-anaesthetic recovery or bereavement team/protocols. Parental presence on these occasions without any framework of ongoing collaboration, communication, etc. does not meet the holistic principles on which family-centred care is based. Types of Outcomes This review will consider studies that include but are not confined to the following outcome measures: Experience of family-centred care models of care from family and/or health providers: clarity of role expectations nature of relationships between family and health care providers parental comfort with the extent of their degree of involvement in child's care content, consistency, timeliness, understandableness and degree to which information provided meets parent's needs family members' stress and anxiety levels adequacy of facilities for family's needs health care providers' support for the collaborative model of care adequacy of health care providers' knowledge and skills, and available time to implement family centred care. Perceptions of family-centred care models of care by family and/or health providers: how the experience is viewed degree to which expectations are being or have been met degree to which the model of care has been individualised to meet specific needs of families degree to which the model of care is implementable in actual operating contexts degree to which health care providers are committed to the model's implementation. Types of studies The review will consider qualitative studies. This includes, but is not limited to, designs such as phenomenology and grounded theory. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. There will be no limitation by publication language and databases will be searched from inception to date. A three-step search strategy will be utilised in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. The databases to be searched include: Medline CINAHL Embase PsycINFO CSA Sociological Abstracts The search for unpublished studies will include: Web of Science Conference Proceedings Australian Research Online UK Clinical Research Network: Portfolio Database Bandolier Google MedNar Initial keywords to be used will be: child/children, parent/s, health services, family centered care/family centred care Assessment of family-centredness To begin with, we will screen all potential studies for family-centredness. In order to assess relevant studies for the degree of family-centredness, this review will utilise a modified rating scale based on that developed by Trivette5 (Appendix I). These authors used the 9 elements of family-centred care, as described by the Association for the Care of Children's Health, to develop 13 evaluation items that describe the features of family-centred care. These sub-elements are further grouped into three cluster groups (Cluster 1: family as a constant; Cluster 2: culturally responsive; Cluster 3: supporting family individuality) derived from an original cluster analysis by Trivette.5 The clusters were designed to be used to help describe the model of family-centred care for individual research studies. A rating of 0 to 4 will be applied to each of the 13 sub-elements of family-centred care, as follows: 0. Article includes no evidence that the intervention either implicitly or explicitly was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 1. Article includes a minimal amount of implicit evidence that the intervention was based on the elements of family-centred care. 2. Article includes numerous instances of implicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 3. Article includes a minimal amount of explicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 4. Article includes numerous instances of explicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. The maximum possible score is 52. Two reviewers will independently score the study against Family Centredness Score Form (Appendix I). The scores from the two reviewers will be averaged as the final score for the study. One of three 'degrees of family-centredness' will be assigned to each study assessed: A study with a score of 42 or more from a possible total of 52 (80%) will be considered as having a \"high degree of family-centredness\", Those studies scoring between 50% and 80% will be classified as having a \"moderate degree of family-centredness\", Those studies scoring below 50% will be classified as having a \"low degree of family-centredness\". Those studies with a family-centeredness score of less than 50% will be excluded from the study. Assessment of methodological quality Those studies that are classified as having either a high or moderate degree of \"family centredness\" will then be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix II).42 Any disagreements that arise on either instrument - family centeredness or quality of studies - between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Qualitative data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from JBI-QARI(Appendix III).42 The data extracted will include specific details about the populations, study methods and findings of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Meta-synthesis of the qualitative findings will be undertaken. This involves aggregation or synthesis of the findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings), and categorising the findings based on similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesised findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice.

Using ANOVA, we compared adults aging solo to those with spouses at home and/or children in the same state. Adults aging solo were significantly more likely to identify non-child/spouse family, friends, neighbors and paid aides as part of their social networks. Their sources of unpaid help included siblings (33%), friends (32%), and non-family (e.g., neighbors (23%)). Adults aging solo were more likely to use paid caregivers, despite having lower incomes than married peers. Interventions to support adults aging solo should incorporate diverse social/help networks.",

L’évaluation de la fréquence de ces relations, ainsi que l’analyse de l’influence des facteurs socio-démographiques et environnementaux fera l’objet d’une comparaison avec la population dite valide, cette dernière étant censée représenter «l’étiage moyen» qui permet de mesurer et de quantifier les écarts. Nous considérons en effet que toute mesure d’un désavantage, d’une discrimination, d’une exclusion ou d’un déficit ne peut se faire dans l’absolu, mais nécessite au contraire un ou plusieurs points de référence. Nous reconnaissons humblement ici, qu’en ce faisant, nous avons, au moins pour partie, cédé au présupposé dominant dans nos sociétés qui fait de la «normalité» et de la «validité» la référence absolue du comportement social et plus généralement humain.

The application of this shared orientation to the intergenerational family role suggests that social background and related roles, subjective meanings and self-feelings, as well as exchange processes influence the interaction of adult children and their elderly parents. Data are derived from a national sample of elderly widows and married persons. Findings include: (I) marital status creates differences in the character and importance of the intergenerational role; (2) the subjective significance attributed to adult children is a major factor which influences patterns of intergenerational interaction; and (3) exchange patterns appear to be more important in influencing the self-feelings of widows than married persons.",

The physical changes of puberty are generally seen as the starting point of adolescence, whilst the end is less clearly delineated. Adolescence ends with attainment of 'full maturity', and a range of social and cultural influences – including the legal age of majority – may influence this. In developed societies these tend to delay progression to adulthood. The extension of compulsory schooling and development of further education, with its economic consequences, generally contributes to a delay in reaching full independence. This may in turn lead to difficulties adjusting to the responsibilities of the next stage of life (Parry-Jones 1995).",

      "abstract": "Depression is usually discussed as an adult problem; however there is a need to recognize it being a significant problem for children. Rarely is depression focused on how it affects parenting and child outcomes, particularly for young children.Often women are victims of violence, and the devastating effects of depression are significant in such households. However one must not ignore, the effect depression has on parenting, where in these contexts, women themselves, become the perpetrators of violence. When mothers are not well-2 central parental functions are threatened: the ability to foster healthy relationships and to carry out the practical functions of parenting2.When this is not carried out, one sees obvious reductions in young children’s behavioral, cognitive, and social and emotional functioning. Neuroscience is clearly evident that the primary ingredient for healthy early brain development is the quality of the earliest relationships from a baby’s primary caregiver.",

The current study focused on male cohabiting partners (MCPs) who can serve as “social stepfathers” and examined the association of coparent support and conflict with their positive parenting behavior (i.e., acceptance, firm control, and monitoring) of adolescents. Participants were 121 low-income urban Black cohabiting stepfamilies (mother, MCP, adolescent). The mother and MCP completed measures on coparenting support and conflict, and the young adolescent completed measures on MCP parenting. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), support, but not conflict, was associated with positive parenting. Support and conflict did not interact to influence parenting. The findings suggest that fathering in these families is contextually sensitive and that support from a mother is central for MCPs to engage in positive parenting of adolescents.",

Yet this disorder has a major impact not only on the identified patient, but also on the spouse or partner (the coaddict) and on the family as a whole. Moreover, the family unit is the context in which the sexual addict continues to live, and the mental health of the partner has a significant impact on the sexual addict's recovery. Increasing evidence points to a family history of addiction or dysfunction as a primary contributor to both sexual addiction and coaddiction in adulthood. When compulsive sexual behaviors are present within a family, treatment of both members of the couple improves the couple's relationship as well as the mental health of each partner. In addition, treatment of children in such a family can help break the cycle of sexual addiction and prevent its perpetuation into the next generation.",

      "title": "Étude longitudinale de facteurs associés aux symptômes de troubles intériorisés et extériorisés en début de scolarisation chez des enfants adoptés de l'étranger",
      "abstract": "Les enfants adoptes de l'etranger connaissent souvent, avant leur adoption, de graves conditions de privation. Ces privations sont de trois ordres : 1) manque de soins medicaux et d'hygiene, et malnutrition; 2) niveau de stimulation insuffisant; 3) absence de relations interpersonnelles stables et de liens privilegies avec un donneur de soin. Ces conditions peuvent affecter le developpement physique, intellectuel et socioaffectif des enfants pendant plusieurs annees, et ceci meme apres l'adoption. Les enfants adoptes de l'etranger presentent, en effet, plus de problemes de comportement que leurs pairs non adoptes pendant l'enfance. Mais ces problemes ne seraient pas uniquement lies a leurs conditions de vie avant l'adoption. Le milieu familial dans lequel evoluent ces enfants jouerait egalement un role important dans leur developpement psychosocial. Cette these de doctorat a pour but de mieux documenter les problemes de comportement en debut de scolarisation des enfants adoptes de l'etranger en ayant recours a une mesure d'autoevaluation et en examinant l'influence de leurs milieux pre et post adoption sur le developpement de ces problemes. La these, qui comporte deux articles, s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une etude longitudinale entreprise par Pomerleau et ses collegues (2005). Le premier article presente une analyse comparative des symptomes de troubles interiorises et exteriorises en debut de scolarisation d'enfants adoptes de l'etranger et d'un groupe d'enfants non adoptes . Sont aussi examines les liens entre les evaluations des enfants et celles de leur mere adoptive et entre les conditions de vie preadoption des enfants et leurs problemes de comportement a l'âge scolaire. L'echantillon est compose de 95 enfants adoptes de l'etranger et de leurs meres. Les enfants ont ete evalues pour la premiere fois deux semaines apres leur arrivee dans leur famille adoptive (âge moyen = 11 mois). L'etat de sante des enfants a leur arrivee (poids, taille, perimetre crânien, signes d'atteinte neurologique) et leur niveau de developpement cognitif et moteur servent d'indices de leurs conditions de vie preadoption. A l'âge de 7 ans, les problemes de comportement des enfants ont ete evalues a l'aide du Dominique interactif, une mesure d'autoevaluation, et du Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) complete par leur mere. Les resultats revelent une seule difference significative entre les enfants adoptes de l'etranger et ceux du groupe de comparaison : les enfants adoptes rapportent plus de symptomes de phobie specifique que leurs pairs. On note egalement une correlation significative entre les symptomes de troubles exteriorises tels qu'evalues par les meres adoptives et les enfants eux-memes mais aucune correlation en ce qui a trait aux symptomes de troubles interiorises. Les problemes de comportement des enfants adoptes sont aussi lies a leur etat de sante a leur arrivee dans leur famille adoptive. De facon plus precise, un faible rapport poids/taille et taille/âge au moment de l'adoption et un perimetre crânien sous le 5e percentile, des indices de malnutrition et de sous stimulation, sont correles aux problemes de comportement des enfants a l'âge scolaire. Le second article examine l'influence des conditions de vie preadoption et du niveau de stress parental des meres sur les problemes de comportement en debut de scolarisation des enfants adoptes de l'etranger. L'un de ses objectifs est egalement d'examiner l'effet du stress maternel sur les liens entre les problemes de comportement des enfants a l'âge scolaire et leur etat au moment de l'adoption, tel que mesure par leurs poids, taille, perimetre crânien, signes d'atteinte neurologique, niveau de developpement cognitif et moteur et âge a l'arrivee. L'echantillon est le meme que celui de l'article precedent, soit 95 enfants adoptes de l'etranger et leurs meres. L'etat de sante physique et le niveau de developpement psychologique a l'arrivee des enfants au Quebec servent d'indicateur de leurs conditions de vie preadoption. Les problemes de comportement ont ete evalues en debut de scolarisation par les enfants eux-memes a l'aide du Dominique interactif et par leur mere qui ont complete le Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) ainsi que l'indice de stress parental (PSI). Les indices de malnutrition et de sous stimulation recueillis a l'arrivee, tel un faible rapport poids/taille, un perimetre crânien sous le 5e percentile, ainsi que des signes d'atteinte neurologique, constituent des facteurs de risque pour le developpement de symptomes de troubles interiorises et exteriorises a l'âge scolaire et le stress parental des meres adoptives agit comme mediateur de cette relation. Les conditions de privation dans lesquelles evoluent les enfants avant leur adoption, soit la malnutrition et la sous stimulation, ont un effet sur leurs problemes de comportement en debut de scolarisation mais cet effet semble, en partie, indirect. Le stress parental qu'eprouvent les meres explique une bonne partie de ces relations. Il apparait donc essentiel de mieux comprendre les facteurs qui peuvent agir sur le stress parental des meres adoptives. Les resultats obtenus portent egalement a croire que des interventions visant a reduire le stress maternel auraient un effet positif sur l'adaptation psychologique des enfants adoptes de l'etranger. Il faut cependant souligner que les enfants adoptes de l'etranger par des familles quebecoises ne presentent, pour la plupart, aucun probleme de comportement en debut de scolarisation. Les resultats de la presente these confirment donc que, malgre les privations qu'ils ont connues avant leur adoption, les enfants adoptes de l'etranger beneficient du milieu stimulant et chaleureux offert par leur famille adoptive.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : Adoption internationale, etude longitudinale, problemes de comportement, stress parental.",

      "abstract": "1Nowadays, the words family or families bring to mind people and their numerous subjective outlooks, people who in their unique situations move along the pathways of complex, “mobile” lives, that are often not fully or properly shared as they were intended. Often, rapid changes are “imposed” within time limits (of daily life and all other manner of reasons), so, for nearly all of us, we feel rushed and this leads to a sense of widespread and undefined discomfort which has now become normal in today’s society. Because this is so commonplace it leads us to believe that we cannot ask for help on which to base purpose-built actions and/or specific services. However, this widespread and undefined discomfort, that often finds expression in identity crises, psychosomatic disorders and difficulties in relationships and so on, runs the risk of turning into a more serious uneasiness; a slow, constant imbalance of one’s mental and emotional wellbeing that must be safeguarded in one’s “normal” spheres of action. That is why the Tuscan project actions for family education are so important in their role as structured educational services for early childhood. The project can, and must, become a place in which the education of the young goes hand in hand with training for parents. By its very nature this is an education in how to change and develop oneself and adapt to the circumstances in which we live, the capacity to transform alongside other people. The actions have been planned and implemented as an integral part of the education services. The family education actions are aimed at socalled normal families (but do exclude those with disabled children, those with social difficulties etc). The actions are planned by consultants (educators, pedagogical coordinators, pedagogues, psychologists, paediatricians etc.) working in concert and parents. The plans have been",

      "abstract": "The world of the child is becoming noisier and noisier. Compared to the mid-fifties environ-mental noise levels (sources such as road traffic, aircraft) increased substantially, causing higher noise levels during day- and night-time at home, at school and during out- and indoors leisure time activities. Also, children spend increasingly more time in situations with (many) other children, such as in day care institutions and kindergartens, with high noise levels due to a com-bination of loud voices, loud toys, and bad acoustics. In an unknown percentage of households, nowadays television or audio-equipment is turned on for the whole day, thus creating an ever-lasting noisy environment for the child. Children may be more annoyed or otherwise adversely affected by noise than adults, in part because they possess less well-developed coping responses, and are often less able to control their environments. It is unknown to which extent aggressive behaviour, helplessness, and hyper-activity are (in part) a consequence of the everlasting noise exposure of the young and older child",

      "title": "Care of the abandoned child.",
      "abstract": "Care of abandoned children in India is discussed in terms of reasons for abandonment, the physical condition of the children, and legal categories. The options available currently are the cottage system, sponsorship programs, foster care, or adoption. Child-care and rehabilitation that may be necessary is specified as is the importance of maintaining records. The gaps in child-care are exposed. The role of nongovernmental organization (NGOs) and new legislation in closing the gaps is presented. Abandonment is usually a direct result of poverty, but it can also be caused by mental or physical handicaps or illegitimacy. The numbers of abandoned children may reach 2 million. 40-60% of abandoned infants die during monsoons and summers. The legal categories are privately abandoned, children on remand, or court-committed children. The cottage system emphasizes deinstitutionalization, but there remains a great demand for care. Sponsorship aims to strengthen the family unit to prevent abandonment. Foster care provides an alternative family substitute, but is known only theoretically. Childcare may involve instant hospitalization, care is an institution, or foster care with a suitable family. Nursery care requires discipline in hygiene, sanitation, maintenance of individual medical records, and a general cheerful atmosphere. Records are important for the child in later life and for adoption. Rehabilitation is a sociolegal process which must be done properly or it can jeopardize a child's future security. Despite the Supreme Court guidelines of 1984, there is no uniform system of adoption practices, and the child's interests are overlooked when adoptions are promoted. NGOs play an important role in making social welfare programs work. However their efforts are of limited help without government support and legislation. There is a lack of proper legislation which is outside the control of political and religious interests; e.g., Hindu law only permits adoption of one child of each sex. Malpractice exists because of the lack of uniform legislation and implementation, and restrictive and delaying tactics are just as harmful to the child. Trafficking in children to foreigners is still profitable. Suggestions include uniform and appropriate legislation, collaborative effort of NGOs and government-endorsed implementation, promotion of innovative and preventive measures to reduce abandonment, and development of an extensive program to provide safeguards against the exploitation of women.",

      "title": "American Families: Trends and Correlates",
      "abstract": "Discussion focused on the nature of the roles of the family, a review of the major demographic changes (marriage, cohabitation, nonfamily households, remarriage, fertility, teenage pregnancy, and female employment) affecting the American family in the past decades, and the nature of the impact on women, men, and children. There were four major trends identified: 1) increased proportions of children living in single-parent families due to high rates of divorce and increased childbearing outside of marriage; 2) increased proportions of adults in nontraditional living arrangements; 3) increased female labor force participation during all stages of the life cycle; and 4) decreased proportions of children and increased proportions of older people out of total population due to declining mortality and fertility rates. Family formation arises out of childbearing and childrearing roles, the need for companionship and emotional support, and the opportunities for specialization and trade, and the economies of scale. The costs of family living may include the potential for disagreement, conflict, loss of privacy, and time and money. There were a number of reasons identified for not maintaining traditional families consisting of a married couple with children. The trends were for later age at marriage: 24.4 years in 1992 for women, increased cohabitation (almost 50% cohabiting prior to first marriage in 1985-86), decreased number of married couple households, and increased number of adults in non-family households. The divorce rate has risen over the past 100 years with peaks in the 1970s; the reasons were identified as increased baby boomers and new marriages, increased labor participation of women, and changes in gender roles. The stabilization and slight decline in rates may be due to a natural leveling, the likelihood of greater stability within new marriages, and the aging of the baby boomers. An anticipated increase in divorce rates in the future was also justified. Remarriage rates varied by gender, age at separation/divorce, presence of children, race/ethnicity, and education. Fertility remained stable at 1.8 during the late 1970s and early 1980s and increased slightly to 2.0 in 1989. IN 1990, there were 25% out-of-wedlock births compared to 5% in 1960. About 12% of births in 1989 were to teenagers. There has been an increase in female-headed households, the median income of which in 1992 was $13,012, or 33% of married couple income.",

Paul Ricoeur) to show how \nthis labour of aging is taken on the by residents of homes for the elderly, either \nstrategically, tactically or under the constraint of biographical accident (handicap, \ninvalidating illness, loss of partner, etc.).

Prácticamente depende exclusivamente de la madre, hasta que el niño se desprenderá de su tutela desde aproximadamente a los 2 años. A partir de ese momento se puede decir que se inicia el proceso de socialización cuando el niño empieza a relacionarse con otros niños y adultos de su entorno inmediato, lo cual es una necesidad para potenciar sus capacidades físicas y mentales que serán determinantes para su futuro porque aprenderá a coexistir con otras personas y superar su egocentrismo. Sin embargo, hay niños que no tienen experiencias previas y pasan dificultades de adaptación en la escuela mostrando actitudes agresivas con sus compañeros, aislándose de los demás o comportándose huraños y llorando inconsolablemente reclamando la presencia de su madre o de un familiar cercano. Este problema ético e ideológico sobre todo entre los sectores más vulnerables de la sociedad ecuatoriana fue abordado por la investigación cuyos resultados son de validez tanto para la comunidad educativa escolar como un aporte que de seguro incrementó el bagaje académico-científico de la Universidad y la comunidad científica en general.",

Stepfamilies often have to negotiate such complexities as being spread across multiple households, dealing with stigma, clarifying unclear roles for family members, and negotiating a lack of legal status between the stepparent and stepchildren. The ways that stepfamilies develop, co‐parent, and self‐disclose have been found to be affected by these factors and often differ from nuclear family dynamics. Less is currently known concerning how stepfamily members communicate with individuals outside the stepfamily system.",

      "abstract": "This research will address the perception that nurses working in a pediatric setting have of their contribution to the process of consent for care. Data analysis reveals an extension of the more conventional definition: here, the very concept of consent is perceived as to include the dimension of a process initiated and continued in dialogue and negotiation. Participants hardly spoke about autonomy but mostly of constantly repeated and renegotiated consent to individual or even routine acts of care. The intent of the nurse is less to obtain the patient’s permission for the caregiver to do his or her job with immunity, in legal terms; it is more to empower the child and his or her parents so as to obtain a collaboration to enable co-management of the disease. Very often, nurses discussed the importance for them of teamwork as the logical way to design their work. It is also logical to extend to parents and children an invitation to participate in the therapeutic team. This is not to say that everything always goes smoothly. The child or the parent may raise opposition. Value conflicts then arise: conflicts and moral distress among nurses generated by the confrontation of beliefs and cultural and religious values different from those the nurse would more easily be comfortable with. But often, the nurse demonstrated a great cultural and religious sensitivity, and even would seek advice from colleagues who could know, more than she, about the value systems that",

      "title": "Influence des adultes sur la représentation multisensorielle de la familiarité sociale dans le cerveau d’un oiseau chanteur",
      "abstract": "Les animaux sociaux apprennent a percevoir leur environnement social au cours du developpement et leurs competences et preferences sociales semblent resulter d’une plus grande exposition a – et donc d’une plus grande familiarite avec – certains signaux plutot que d’autres. Or, familiarite et integration multisensorielle semblent etre intimement liees. De plus, la capacite a differencier et categoriser des individus familiers et non familiers et a construire une representation multisensorielle des individus familiers semble emerger d’interactions sociales successives, en particulier avec des modeles adultes experimentes. Chez diverses especes, les adultes modelent en effet le comportement social des jeunes, notamment en focalisant l’attention de ces derniers sur des signaux multisensoriels. Cela amene a se demander quelle representation des individus familiers des animaux prives de modeles adultes peuvent construire. Dans cette etude, nous montrons que des etourneaux prives d’experience avec des adultes ne semblent pas developper de representation multisensorielle des etourneaux familiers et non familiers. Des enregistrements electrophysiologiques de l’activite neuronale dans l’aire auditive primaire de ces oiseaux, en reponse a des signaux auditifs ou audio-visuels familiers ou non, montrent que, bien que les stimuli visuels modulent les reponses auditives (comme c’est aussi le cas chez les etourneaux sauvages), cette modulation n’est pas influencee par la familiarite. Les etourneaux prives de modeles adultes semblent donc incapables de discriminer des individus familiers et non familiers. Ceci suggere que les adultes influencent le developpement, dans le cerveau, d’une representation multisensorielle des individus familiers, sans doute en focalisant l’attention des jeunes sur des signaux multisensoriels pertinents. La presence d’adultes pendant le developpement apparait donc cruciale pour l’acquisition de competences sociales essentielles (comme le fait de construire une representation multisensorielle des individus familiers), et ce au niveau meme des substrats cerebraux qui les sous-tendent.",

      "title": "Asylum, Children as Seekers of",
      "abstract": "Broadly speaking, an asylum seeker can be defined or described as a person who has left their country of origin and formally applied for asylum in another country, which has not yet been granted. Historically, children’s involvement in seeking asylum has been subsumed under family or kin migration. Consequently, children were largely treated as objects travelling with adults, or their experience conflated with those of women and mothers. However, the last 20 years has seen a gradual shift away from this perspective to understanding children’s role in migration as people with both feelings and agency in their own right, separate from the adults around them. In turn, there is now significant attention paid to children who seek asylum alone (see also Unaccompanied entry). In some situations, children may hope or expect to join kin who are already settled in the destination country. Perhaps rarer, are children sent ahead of adults who later hope to join them once asylum is achieved. In some asylum situations, children born in the country their family migrated to, face the prospect of being able to stay behind whilst their parents are deported.",

      "abstract": "Everyday patterns of interaction can strengthen or undermine bonds between family members. This naturalistic observation study focused on an understudied facet of family life: opportunities for interaction among dual-earner family members after work and family members' responses to these opportunities. Thirty dual-earner couples and their children were observed and video-recorded in their homes throughout two weekday afternoons and evenings. Two interaction opportunities were analyzed: (1) the behavior of family members toward a parent returning home from work and (2) the physical proximity of family members throughout the evening. Three main findings emerged. Women, who tended to return home before men, were greeted with positive behavior and reports of the day's information from family members. Men, in contrast, returned home later in the day and received positive behavior or no acknowledgment from family members distracted by other activities. Throughout the evening, mothers spent more time with children whereas fathers spent more time alone. Couples were seldom together without their children. The implications of observed interaction patterns and the contribution of naturalistic observation methods to the study of family relationships are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Physical abuse of children is caused by a variety of interacting and interlocking forces. Child abuse is as old as time itself. The practice of infanticide was widely accepted among ancient and prehistoric peoples as a legitimate means of dealing with unwanted children. A hyperactive child can become a focal point of the parents' aggression. Some people make excellent partners but cannot take into a relationship a third person - a child. The child then becomes a symbol of the broken relationship. Poverty is not in itself a cause of abuse, but the stress and lack of support and resources which characterize extreme social disadvantage can reduce the parents' general adaptation and self-control, thereby increasing the likelihood of family violence. To work effectively in the field of child abuse the worker needs to integrate into one holistic approach the operation of the law and the skills of his/her social work profession - the Integration of Law and Social Work.",

Research questions were addressed from a nationwide sample of 593 adults parenting at least one child. Findings highlight the heightened severity of conflict in the couple relationship relative to equivalent topics appearing in parent–child subsystems as well as topics with greater conflict severity between parents and adolescents (e.g., being distant) and topics with greater severity between parents and younger children (e.g., food/picky eating). Salient sources of conflict in present-day families (e.g., technology/phone use in the parent–adolescent subsystem, mood and tempers in all subsystems) were also identified. Findings from the study illustrate ways in which conflict topics appear similarly and differently across distinct family subsystems as well as which conflict topics have changed in families over time and those that have remained constant.",

      "abstract": "Although they yearn for it, not all families can live together in their daily life. Many factors are causing some families to decide to live a long-distance relationship (LDR). This issue certainly will bring new problems in the provision of stimulation in the development of children’s emotional-social intelligence. Children need stimulation from both parents to get their emotional-social development improved optimally. The introduction of digital literacy at an early age can be one of the creative and effective solutions for a long-distance family relationship to optimize their children’s emotional-social stimulation. There are several things parents need to consider when introducing digital literacy in early childhood, including; 1) agreement from both parents; 2) schedule or time to communicate; 3) child-friendly simple application; 4) communication time limit, and 5) accompaniment for children during communication",

      "title": "The family in Italy: Cultural changes and implications for treatment",
      "abstract": "In Italy family is characterized by strong ties and is based on mutual aid of all its members. In the last 20 years, the structure of families has been significantly influenced by demographic, economic and professional changes, determining a transition from a patriarchal to a nuclear family model, with a higher number of single-parent families, single-person households, childless couples, same-sex couples. However, this transition has been slower than that occurring in other countries, probably as an ongoing impact of prevalent Catholic ideology. Major demographic changes in Italian families include, 1) a decrease in the number of marriages, delays in getting married and an high number of civil ceremonies, 2) a reduced birth rate; Italy is becoming one of the European countries with lowest growth rate, and with an increasing number of births out of wedlock, 3) an increased marital instability, with a constantly growing number of legal separations. Like many countries, relatives in Italy are highly involved in the care of patients with physical and mental disorders. There are a number of psychosocial interventions used in Italy including the 'Milan Systemic Approach' and family psycho-educational interventions. However, there are difficulties in implementing these interventions which are highlighted in this paper. We recommend research strategies to identify the best options to involve families in the care of mentally ill patients and to adequately support them.",

      "abstract": "In this study, 42 participants (including newlyweds, parents of newlyweds, and siblings of newlyweds) were interviewed about their relationships with their in-laws. Most of the participants reported that they liked their in-laws and wanted to maintain good relationships with them, while only four of the participants reported problematic inlaw relationships. However, participants reported differing levels of discomfort with their in-laws when their routines differed for everyday life, holiday celebrations, religious practice, gift-giving, and interpersonal interactions. Families rarely communicated their routines directly. Instead they continued with their everyday routines and expected the newcomer to fit in. The newcomers found it easy to adjust to some routines that were similar to their own, but they felt confused or rebellious in response to other routines. The newcomers attempted to create roles for themselves in their spouse's families, and sometimes both the newcomer and the family of the spouse learned new values, created new routines, and found new ways to interact. Participants also reported that tensions existed between the married couple and their larger families regarding how much time the couple should spend with their families. These findings suggest that problematic inlaw relationships may be due to differences in family routines and communication patterns.",

      "abstract": "In cooperative breeders, parents that receive help with offspring care may either maintain their own effort or reduce it in compensation so that offspring gain little. Here, I build on an approach developed by McNamara et al. (McNamara, Gasson, and Houston 1999. Incorporating rules for responding into evolutionary games. Nature. 401: 368–371 and McNamara, Szekely, Webb, and Houston 2003. Should young ever be better off with one parent than with two? Behav Ecol. 14: 301–310.) to model behavioral negotiation over care in a cooperatively breeding species. I show that parental responsiveness to helper effort should vary with the shape of the parental cost function and that sex differences in the costs of care can give rise to sex differences in response to helpers. Such differences in responsiveness have major implications for the evolution of helping effort. When load lightening occurs, help may benefit mothers or fathers as much as offspring and to different degrees depending on the behavior of the 2. Consequently, when considering the influence of relatedness on helping effort, it is not only the relatedness of helpers to the young they assist that matters. Whether maternal or paternal kin help more, for instance, should reflect the relative degree of compensation by female and male parents. To understand helping, one must consider the whole pattern of relatedness among family members, as well as the ways in which they respond to one another.",

      "abstract": "Polygamous family structures present unique challenges to early childhood development, particularly in terms of emotional security, social adaptability, and access to paternal care, yet remain underexplored in academic research. This study explores the role of fathering in shaping early childhood adjustment within polygamous family structures. It investigates how different levels of paternal involvement, such as caregiving, emotional support, and educational engagement, affect children's social and emotional development. Using a qualitative case study approach, data were collected through interviews, observations, and documentation involving two fathers who live separately from one or more of their wives and serve as the sole economic providers in their households. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns of fathering practices and their relation to children's adjustment outcomes. Findings reveal stark contrasts between the two parenting approaches. One father demonstrated high engagement, shared household responsibilities, and fostered autonomy in educational decision-making, contributing to the child’s emotional security and social adaptability. In contrast, the other father adhered to traditional and authoritative roles, fully delegating caregiving to his wives and limiting his children’s external social exposure, which may hinder their emotional development and peer interaction. This study highlights the importance of culturally contextualized fathering and calls for inclusive parenting programs that accommodate diverse family structures, especially within polygamous contexts. However, the study is limited by its small sample size and context-specific focus, which may constrain the broader applicability of its conclusions. Future research is recommended to involve more diverse participants across regions and apply longitudinal methods to explore long-term patterns of fathering and early childhood development within varied family configurations.",

One‐year‐olds' coordinated actions appeared more coincidental than cooperative whereas older children appeared to be more actively cooperating toward a shared goal.

The second study looked at same-sex marriage support from the perspectives of family members of recently married same-sex couples, involving participants from Canada and the US. Those who supported individuals in same-sex marriages were typically very happy for them, and any concerns were specific to the couple. Additionally, most felt they had always been supportive of same-sex marriage and identified key life experiences influencing their views, such as having open-minded parents, higher levels of education, and personal and/or professional interactions with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals in which they got to know the individuals on more than just a surface level.",

      "abstract": "A critical arena of family change, the stepfamily, affects a large per centage of American families, and yet has been virtually ignored as a family law issue. It is estimated that about one-fourth of the children born will live with a stepparent before they reach majority.1 Initially fashioned for traditional family relations, federal and state legislation are in many ways out of touch with the current needs and emerging patterns of stepfamilies and are sometimes in conflict with each other.2 Overall there is a lack of legal recognition of the stepparent/stepchild relationship. While marriage clearly defines obligations and rights be tween the stepparent and the child's natural parent, the stepchild is not considered part of this web of rights and obligations, even when the child resides in the same household.3 With few exceptions, stepparents have no obligation during the marriage to support their stepchildren, even while they have an obligation to support their spouse, the child's parent.4 Nor do stepparents have any right of custody or control. If the marriage terminates through divorce or death, they most often have no rights of custody or visitation, no matter how longstanding their step parent role. And stepparents do not have any obligation to pay child",

      "abstract": "America has undergone a psychological revolution in the past 2 decades. 20 years ago people defined their satisfactions and problems in terms of how well they lived up to traditional work and family roles; today people have become more introspective more attentive to inner experience. Because of the continuing stream of new family scholarship as well as shifts in public attitudes toward the family each edition of this book is different from the previous one. Part of the confusion surrounding the current status of the family arises from the fact that the family is an inherently problematic area of study; there are few if any self-evident facts even statistical ones. Although anthropologists have tried to come up with a single definition of family that would hold across time and place they generally have concluded that doing so is not useful. Through reproduction and socialization the family presumably guarantees the continuation of society through time. Traditionally theories of socialization have taken either of 2 perspectives: 1) social molding--the child is likened to a blank slate or lump of clay waiting to be shaped by the environment; and 2) animal taming--the infant is a wild beast whose antisocial instincts need to be tamed by parents. Although the belief that early family experience is the most powerful influence in a childs life is widely shared by social scientists and the public it is not well supported by evidence and theory. Many of the difficulties besetting family life today are the consequences of some very positive changes: the decline of infant mortality and death rates in general the fact that people are living longer the use of birth control the spread of mass education and the increasing control of the individual over basic life decisions. Family life is bound up with the social economic and ideological circumstances of particular times and places.",

      "title": "Stepfamilies and cultural transmission dynamics in Congo Basin hunter-gatherers",
      "abstract": "Generally high rates of adult mortality coupled with cultural approval of divorce/remarriage mean that alternatives to the ‘nuclear model’ of the family can be common in contemporary hunter-gatherer communities. While many studies of hunter-gatherer societies have emphasised the flexible, cooperative nature of childcare, research has not specifically considered how step-parents navigate their unique roles in the lives of their own or their partner’s children. Additionally, research has only just begun to investigate the ways in which cooperative caretaking interacts with the dynamics of cultural evolution in hunter-gatherer societies. For instance, vertical cultural transmission (ie learning from parents) has repeatedly been shown as important among hunter-gatherers. Yet, the implications of alternative family forms for the dynamics of cultural transmission are unclear. For instance, step-parents may enhance the spread and longevity of novel cultural traits by moving from a social role associated with oblique cultural transmission to one associated with vertical transmission from the perspective of their stepchildren. In this paper, we 1) present a mathematical model of cultural transmission under conditions where step-parenting is more or less common but step-parents can transmit culture in the same way as parents versus other adults (eg through vertical versus oblique cultural transmission), and then 2) present a preliminary survey of the frequency of alternative families from two BaYaka communities in northern Republic of the Congo. Our modelling shows that remarriage and step-parenting can increase the frequency of a new cultural trait and its eventual mean frequency in a population. Validating the premise of the model, our data confirm that high rates of divorce, adult mortality and remarriage mean that many BaYaka children in our sample live with step-parents. We then discuss how our model and the demographic data can be interpreted considering the ethnographic reality of the study communities and the region, and how this provides the potential for step-parenting to facilitate cultural adaptation. We conclude that the integration of data on family diversity and demography with cultural evolutionary modelling can further our understanding of cultural transmission in hunter-gatherer societies and beyond.",

      "title": "Social Stratification, Health, and Violence in the Very Young",
      "abstract": "A bstract : Inequalities in human social groups contribute in important ways to the initiation and perpetuation of violence. Because both social inequalities and interpersonal aggression emerge in early life, it is important to study their developmental origins in the collective and individual behavior of young children. As young as 2 years of age, children assemble stable, linearly transitive dominance hierarchies when brought together in novel social groups. Just as the consequences of socioeconomic status may be due in part to experiences of social ordering per se, subjective childhood experiences of occupying a lesser or greater position on a scale of social influence may similarly affect health, safety, and behavior in early development. Children's experiences with social ordering may represent a first, formative encounter with the hierarchical social relations that affect health and susceptibility to violence over the human lifespan. We have studied the health correlates of group stressors, dominance positions, and biobehavioral reactivity within cohorts of preschool children and semi free‐ranging rhesus macaques. Social position is ascertained using naturalistic observations of critical dyadic events, and stress‐reactivity is measured using assessments of behavioral and biological responses to standardized challenges. Outcome measures, including indicators of mental and physical health and interpersonal injuries, have been assessed—in the case of children—with parent‐ and teacher‐report questionnaires, child self‐report protocols, and frequent, objective physical examinations of the child and—in the case of rhesus monkeys—with daily observations of violence‐related injuries. Results to date have suggested the following provisional conclusions: (1) Children and monkeys form stable, linearly transitive social hierarchies in which identifiable subgroups of individuals occupy dominant and subordinate social positions. (2) Individuals occupying subordinate positions within the social group show exaggerated adrenocortical and/or autonomic reactivity to challenge and disproportionate rates of chronic medical conditions or violent injuries. (3) Stress‐reactivity, naturally occurring stressors, and social position are interactively predictive of rates of morbidity. Monkeys who displayed high biobehavioral reactivity sustained disproportionate numbers of violent injuries during a confinement stressor. Children who were high in the dominance hierarchy and low in reactivity showed significantly higher rates of externalizing mental health symptoms, while those who were in subordinate social positions and high in reactivity showed higher prevalences of internalizing symptoms. In conclusion, the prevention of youth violence—and other forms of early disorder—will require a deeper, developmental understanding of the “headwaters” of aggression and victimization in early childhood and a stronger accounting of how early social inequalities set trajectories toward healthy or disordered behavior.",

      "abstract": "Little is known about the experiences of human trafficking survivors over the long term. Why do some survivors experience re-victimization while others do not? Drawing from longitudinal interviews with 64 female sex trafficking survivors in Cambodia, we use qualitative comparative analysis to compare which conditions in the lives of survivors are associated with re-exploitation and which are associated with not experiencing re-exploitation. We found there are multiple factors associated with re-exploitation tied to poverty, debt, low education, and social isolation from friends, family, and the community. Poverty is a necessary condition but is not sufficient for explaining re-exploitation on its own. Conditions contributing to the absence of re-exploitation include not having debt, not sending remittances to family, being married with children, and having social support from family, friends and/or the community. We discuss distinctions between social support for survivors (e.g., from social service organizations) and broader social protections (embedded in social and cultural institutions). Each is relevant for post-trafficking services and survivor reintegration in different ways.",

      "abstract": "Children's early years are a time when many families move home. Does residential mobility affect children's wellbeing at age five in terms of cognitive and behavioural development? The question arises as moving home is sometimes portrayed as a stressful life event adversely affecting child development, particularly if frequent. Other studies suggest a more mixed role for home moves, which may reflect good or bad changes in family circumstances. This paper first presents evidence from the first five years of the UK Millennium Cohort Study about who moved, how often and why. We find that many British families at this point in the life cycle move to improve the housing of a growing family. We then investigate the relationship between the number of moves and child outcomes. Generally, moving displays an adverse association with our three indicators of child development at age five. However the adverse association is statistically explained by changes in family structure, employment status, insecure housing tenure, and other controls for family vulnerabilities. Moving is better seen as sometimes a response to other family stressors. Differentiating moves in terms of their destination we find that moving into the 30% poorest areas, as well as 'failing' to move out of them, shows some adverse outcomes for children. After allowing for other associations with family disadvantage, also apparent in other studies of the Millennium Cohort, we find a small but significant disadvantage to living in low-income areas as well as moving within them.",

Vor dem Eintritt in das Erwachsenenleben und nach der Kindheit befindet sich die Jugendphase. Wahrend dieser Zeit stehen Jugendliche vor etlichen Entwicklungsaufgaben. Gesellschaftlicher Wandel hat zu einer Verlangerung der Jugendphase gefuhrt. Grundlegende Veranderungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt verursachen Prekaritat. Durch die Arbeitsmarktunsicherheit und die Veranderungen in der Familienstruktur sowie die verlangerte Jugendphase ergeben sich immer mehr Probleme bei der Bewaltigung der Entwicklungsaufgaben. \r\nDas Wohlbefinden der Jugendlichen steht in einem Missverhaltnis zwischen den gesellschaftlichen Erwartungen, Lebensbedingungen und den eigenen Bedurfnissen.

      "title": "SENSE OF PLACE IN DEVELOPMENTAL CONTEXT",
      "abstract": "Sense of place differs from place attachment by considering the social and geographical context of place bonds and the sensing of places, such as aesthetics and a feeling of dwelling. Insider status and local ancestry are important toward the development of a more rooted sense of place. Three contexts are used to examine the development of sense of place: residential status in the place (superficial, partial, personal, ancestral, and cultural senses of place); age stage, as in development across the life cycle, using a psychodynamic model (after Erikson and Vaillant); and development of the adult pair bond, most often in marriage. Being raised in the place affected feelings of rootedness, particularly for Maori peoples who have ties to tribal territory. Interactions were found among place and pair bonds, and multigenerational patterns were noted for ancestral and cultural senses of place, with sense of place styles passed from parent to child. Modern society, due especially to high levels of residential mobility, tends to develop more of a partial or personal sense of place among its members. Sequential stages in the development of a sense of place were most evident among those who were raised in the place and spent most of their lives there: embryonic (childhood to adolescent); commitment (early to mid adulthood); and culmination (mid adulthood to old age). These became apparent in phenomenological and statistical analyses of responses from 270 adult residents of Banks Peninsula, New Zealand, of both Maori and European descent. Additional interviews were conducted with 80 adult out-migrants from the Peninsula; brief surveys were also done of tourists, long-term campers, holiday home owners, and resident school children on Banks Peninsula. Models of place attachment need to be reconsidered, as does the value of developing a sense of place based more on ancestral and cultural connections. Such a sense of place is considered to be of benefit to individuals and to modern society. ©1998 Academic Press",

Although it is seen as a period of relaxation and tranquillity, retirement from work, also because it is associated with other relevant changes in an individual’s life related to family relationships, brings with it a number of potential risks that may trigger problems of a psychosocial nature (identity crisis, change of parental role, adaptation to new marital relationships, possible marital crisis and divorce, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideas) which, in turn, may be facilitators of fragility also on the physical side. The attention of the various governments is generally focused on the health problems of those who are retired with a view to containing public expenditure, without considering the fact that the main problems for this particular segment of the population may come from problems of reintegration into social life and occupation of leisure time. When there is no adequate adaptation to the changed conditions of life in the transition from worker to pensioner one fatally exposes oneself to the risk of progressive isolation. the reduction of social contracts, the contraction of the use of one’s cognitive functions with possible consequences in the medium to long term on one’s ability to remain self-sufficient. This would ultimately turn into a socio-medical problem, with the associated costs, when an appropriate policy of psycho-social interventions could delay the effects.",

Aunque no todos los menores tienen por qué sufrir daño psicológico o secuelas graves (como ansiedad anticipatoria, reexperimentación del hecho traumático, conflicto de lealtades o sentimientos como vergüenza, miedo o culpa), les resulta como poco un acontecimiento ansiógeno y no todos poseen las estrategias o habilidades para afrontarlo sin que les quede una huella psicológica. Afortunadamente, cada vez es más frecuente que se implementen medidas en los juzgados para amortiguar estas consecuencias. En cuanto a la intervención psicológica, se puede realizar antes, durante y después de acudir a los juzgados tanto con el menor como con los progenitores o cuidadores principales para que no sean también ellos una presión añadida para el niño o la niña.",

      "title": "LONG-TERM AND LATER-LIFE STEPGRANDPARENT-STEPGRANDCHILD RELATIONSHIPS",
      "abstract": "Stepgrandchild-stepgrandparent relationships are increasingly common as a result of relatively high rates of divorce and remarriage and improved longevity. Positive intergenerational step-relationships can strengthen feelings of family solidarity and promote the social, emotional, and physical well-being of stepfamily members, yet little is known about how stepgrandchildren or stepgrandparents define and develop roles and relationships following remarriage. Guided by a developmental life course change perspective and grounded theory methods, we interviewed 41 stepgrandchildren about their relationships with 61 stepgrandparents. Some stepgrandchildren (N = 24) acquired stepgrandparents when they were adolescents or young adults (i.e., a biological grandparent remarried in later-life), while other stepgrandchildren (N = 37) acquired stepgrandparents before birth (i.e., a biological grandparent remarried when a parent of the stepgrandchild was young). Attention to variations in the ways in which stepgrandparents were acquired allowed for systematic examination of relational processes and contextual factors that affected stepgrandchild-stepgrandparent relationships in different family structures. Findings revealed that stepgrandchildren’s closeness to stepgrandparents was influenced by factors such as timing of life transitions (e.g., when in individuals’ life courses intergenerational relationships began), stepgrandparents’ roles in the life of the middle-generation parent and the quality of those relationships, whether or not the stepfamily defined the stepgrandparent as kin (e.g., through the use of claiming language), intergenerational contact frequency, stepgrandparents’ affinity-building and how stepgrandchildren responded to stepgrandparents’ efforts. Findings underscore the importance of attending to context when examining processes that affect intergenerational step-relationship development. Implications for researchers, practitioners, and educators are discussed.",

      "title": "Adolescent Identity Development in Foster Care",
      "abstract": "Adolescent Identity Development in Foster Care* Susan M. Kools** This study examined the impact of long-term foster care on adolescents. Dimensional analysis was used to investigate adolescent perceptions of impact. Foster care was found to have a negative impact on identity development. The institutional structure of group foster care, diminished status, and stereotypical view of the foster child, contribute to devaluation of the adolescent's self by others. Suggestions for clinical practice and program development are made to reduce devaluating experiences and promote normative adolescent development. Children and adolescents are growing up in a variety of family constellations today. For a growing number, longterm foster care provides a substitution for the context of their biological families. While originally conceived as a temporary respite for troubled families until reunification could be achieved, it has become increasingly used as a permanent living arrangement for many children. Foster care is defined as residence in a supervised setting outside the biological family as mandated by the social services or juvenile justice system. Foster care placements for children and adolescents include foster family care, group homes, and various forms of residential treatment. Foster care placement is most often precipitated by stressful family circumstances that endanger a child and/or deem the biological parent(s) unable or unavailable to adequately care for the child. These include child abuse and neglect, parental substance abuse, and family homelessness (Barker & Aptekar, 1990; Children's Defense Fund, 1995; U.S. Congress, 1990a; U.S. Congress, 1990b; White & Benedict, 1985). Nearly 500,000 children are currently in foster care in the United States. If the increases continue, this number could approach 840,000 by the end of the decade (American Public Welfare Association, 1995; U.S. Congress, 1990a). Further, although length of stay in placement can vary widely from days to years, it is becoming typical for a child to spend from several years to the duration of childhood in foster care. Current estimates are that 40% of children remain in foster care for more than 2 years, with an average stay of 5 years (Pothier & Kools, 1992; U.S. Congress, 1990a). Finally, a trajectory characterized by multiple placement transitions is now commonplace for the foster care population. Up to 55% of children in foster care experience 3 or more placements (Byles, 1980; Fanshel & Shinn, 1978; Runyan & Gould, 1985a.1985b). Most theoretical and empirical literature on normative child and adolescent development places the developing child within the context of the family system. In their study of African American adolescents in foster care, Gavazzi, Alfred, and McKenry (1996) noted that there has been little emphasis on the developmental impact of living in an alternate environment like foster care. As the foster care system has rapidly grown, it has come under scrutiny and it has been suggested that growing up in foster care has multiple negative consequences for the child (Halfon, Berkowitz, & Klee, 1992; U.S. Congress, 1990a). While the impact of foster care on overall functioning, development, and wellbeing has yet to be adequately determined, investigators have begun to gather evidence that severe functional impairment is suffered by children in foster care as a group, including poor academic achievement, behavioral and emotional problems, and health-related problems (Frank, 1980; Gil & Bogart, 1982; Halfon, Mendoca, & Berkowitz, 1995; Hochstadt, Jaudes, Zimo, & Schachter, 1987; Klee & Halfon, 1987; Pardeck, 1983; Runyan & Gould, 1985a, 1985b; Simms, 1991; Simms & Halfon, 1994; U.S. Government Accounting Office, 1995). Most of these studies were based on retrospective case record review. Very few researchers have interviewed children in foster care to explore their thoughts and feelings about their status as foster children or their placement experiences. …",

      "title": "Childhood Publics",
      "abstract": "Childhood publics are the ways in which children are connected through issues of common care and concern and the processes of mediation that can connect children and give these issues a broader audience. The term “childhood publics” came to the fore with the publication of Children’s Participation, Childhood Publics, and Social Change: A Review, cited under Children and the Public Sphere. Publics, a key phenomenon of modernity, emerge in everyday life and at the margins of institutional life and the market. In childhood, this might bring researchers to focus on the peripheries of schooling and of family life, the settings and times of leisure and play both in person and online, and/or the in-between-institutional times and spaces, such as walking to and from school or a friend’s place, when children themselves may be left largely to their own devices, with little to no adult supervision and input. Finding such spaces and times is itself a challenge, and it might be that childhood publics is only ever partial and/or relies on intergenerational solidarities. For example, younger children are far more dependent on an adult presence and mediated by adult interlocutors, because childhood and youth itself as increasingly instrumentalized and the spaces and times for idling, boredom, daydreaming, meandering, plotting, alone and together, have shrunk considerably within the family (children’s, especially middle-class children’s, timetables are full with extracurricular activities), but also because the funding for public infrastructures which all children, but especially those from lower-income families, might access in order to congregate (e.g., youth centers) has steadily declined in postindustrialized societies. Concerns over children’s safety in cities, children’s restricted access to their own income and availability, and age restrictions on places where children could meet all mean that meeting places like streets and squares and cafes, traditional locations of publics formation, might need to be rethought in childhood publics. Children are also vastly underrepresented and under-researched as cultural producers. At the same time, a range of online spaces have emerged where some publics formation can take place, although again, such spaces may pose (typically, age) restrictions on younger children; safety over their use is also an issue. Developing an understanding of publics requires unpacking the relationship between public and private, the personal and the political, as well as modes and media of connection in children’s lives both in person and online, all of which are covered in this article. There is also a key question of how adult interlocutors might understand and act on children’s speech acts and other forms of expression. Finally, as a phenomenon of modernity much of the initial literature on the topic has been written with a Western context in mind. This does not mean that publics do not exist outside the postindustrialized democracies; instead it is a reminder to be mindful of their historical and cultural specificity of writing and research on the topic and to be sensitive to local variations. The entry starts by introducing key readings on publics, followed by historical and contemporary examples of childhood publics, before proceeding to cover analytical dimensions of childhood publics and closing with an overview of publics-creating methodologies with children. The entry has been written with a global childhood publics in mind, and where available and accessible, international examples have been included.",

Transitions can be stressful and often include changes as part of early intervention or special education services. It is important to understand these transitions because the support families receive can influence child and family well-being. Therefore, we interviewed parents ( N = 28) across a rural U.S. state about their experiences of transition over time. Using thematic analysis, three common themes emerged: (a) change is constant, (b) positive relationships support changing needs and priorities, and (c) parents need more support, information, or access to services or providers. Parents reported relationships and collaboration with providers to be important, yet insufficient, in supporting transitions. Rurality added some challenges to parents’ experiences with transition. Recommendations include empowering families, providing more access and/or removing barriers to services, and building family efficacy through family-focused services.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, under the influence of cultural and social transformations, the quality and form of parental involvement in stimulating the cognitive activity of children has been changing. In meeting social and cultural demands, parents often engage in searching for innovative forms of education. They are increasingly often guided by trends and popularity, abandoning traditional methods of supporting children in their cognitive development. Therefore, parents often choose modern proposals, diversified in terms of quantity and quality, advertised in the mass media and promoted by teachers, psychologists and sometimes also by their acquaintances. Parents' involvement in stimulating the cognitive activity of their child is a complex process, which encounters various limitations and impediments in everyday life. They result, among others, from diminishing the role of play in the family, of free time spent together, from reducing the number of children in the family to only one, from a high speed of life, the domination of new information and communication technologies, a lack of time, following the trends, excessive, parental ambitions inadequate to the child's capabilities, their requirements towards the child and realization of their own dreams. Under such conditions, stimulating the cognitive activity of a child does not always bring expected results that are directly proportional to time and money invested. On the contrary, it is often difficult for parents to see clear, measurable effects. This is particularly true in situations when parents resign from simple, traditional, proved methods of supporting their child in cognitive development and follow fashion, striving for satisfaction of their own, excessive ambitions. The choice of specific forms of stimulating cognitive activity of a child and parents' approach determine, to a high extent, not only the quality of their role in this process, but also the efficiency of undertaken activities.",

      "title": "Family-centred care for hospitalized children aged 0-12 Years: A systematic review of qualitative studies",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of the review is to synthesise the existing evidence on family and/or health providers' experience of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children aged 0-12 years (excluding premature neonates). (*Some sections of this protocol are adopted or adapted from the Cochrane Systematic Review of family-centred care in hospitalised children 0-12 years (2007)1 and its update (2012)2 and are published here with permission from Wiley. A more detailed discussion of the development of the concept of family-centred care is available in these publications.) Background Family-centred care is defined as “a way of caring for children and their families within health services which ensures that care is planned around the whole family, not just the individual child/person, and in which all the family members are recognized as care recipients”.3, p.1318 A number of related terms have been used to describe the attributes of family-centred care;4 these include partnership-in-care,5 parental involvement,6 nurse-parent partnership,3 parental participation,7 and care-by-parent.8,9 Until at least the late 1950s, hospitals worldwide tended to be bleak places for children. It was believed that visits from parents would inhibit effective care10 and were detrimental to the child, who would become distressed when the parents left.11,12 Researchers began to suggest, however, that children whose parents did not visit them suffered acute emotional trauma which may have long-term psychological consequences in adolescence and adulthood.13,14 In 1956, the British government commissioned a report into the welfare of children in hospital. The resulting report, the Platt Report15, recommended that visiting be unrestricted, that mothers stay in hospital with their child, and that training of medical and nursing staff should promote understanding of the emotional needs of children. The process of change has resulted in a humanisation of paediatrics,16,17 although the movement away from traditional approaches to health service delivery to the involvement of families in all aspects of the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care has been slow.18,19 The foundation for a family-centred approach to paediatric health care is the belief that a child's emotional and developmental needs, and overall family wellbeing, are best achieved when the service system supports diligently the ability of the family to meet the needs of their child, by involving families in the plan of care.20–22 Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of Family-Centred Care There are a range of potential benefits and difficulties associated with the provision of family-centred care. One of these is the degree to which the family is seen as responsible for the child's care. In a number of cases family-centred care has been interpreted as care that is led by parents, who are regarded as expert in the care of their child, with the health professional acting as a consultant.6,7 However, in recent years research has indicated that parents feel that they are being made totally responsible for the care of their child and the expectations of them, at least initially, are too great. In Coyne and Cowley's8 words: “the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction”.p.893 They are much more comfortable working a truly collaborative way with health-care providers.9 The hospitalisation of a child, whether planned or unplanned, is stressful for even the most well-organised and functional family.23 The significant adjustments to both parent and healthcare provider roles when a child is hospitalised may result in understandable levels of stress.24 A number of studies report that the stress levels of parents are reduced by being more informed and involved in caring for their children while in hospital.25 However, on the other hand involvement can lead, at least in the short term, to additional stress or anxiety for both the parents and child. Parents may feel that they are expected to provide input into the care of their child beyond their expectations or capabilities, or are given more information than either the child or the family is ready to hear. Professional communication and the provision of information are key elements in the success or otherwise of family centred care. In their study of parents' information needs in relation to their chronically ill children, Hummelinck and Pollock26 highlighted the double-edged nature of information in these situations; there is a delicate balance between the positive effects and the potentially negative impact i.e. it can increase anxiety. Information was also a theme identified in Ygge's27 study of nurses' perceptions of parental involvement in hospital care. Not only did the nurses indicate that it was important to discuss with the parents what information was important to them at each stage, but that the information provided to them must be the same from all health personnel. Family centred care also requires specifically designed or adapted facilities. Verwey, et al28 found that attending to parent's physical needs was an important component in reducing stress. Ensuring aspects such as comfortable sleeping arrangements, nutritious food and time to relax away from the ward made a family's experience a more positive one. Researchers have also reported challenges when trying to implement changes which would result in meaningful family involvement in the care of their hospitalised child. Healthcare providers have reported a lack of adequate education in relation to understanding and implementing the concept of family-centred care in a practice situation, as well a lack of shared understanding of, and commitment to, family-centred care among all health professionals and families.18, 29–32 Darbyshire7 suggested that family-centred care was a wonderful idea, but difficult to implement effectively. A number of authors agree, questioning family-centred care as a model of care.31,33 and the ethics of continuing a model which is becoming increasingly described as ineffective are under scrutiny.34 Standard Models of Health Care for Children Family-centred care is regarded as different to the ‘standard’ models of care used in paediatric health services. In the latter, often the healthcare provider plays a major role in assessing and formulating a plan of care, based upon the perceived needs of the child and/or family. In the medical or standard model of health care, the healthcare worker plans care around the child's illness and treatment needs, and the family is generally expected to comply with treatment recommendations.35 Implementation of Family-Centred Care It is expected that the development, implementation and outcomes of family-centred models of care may differ according to the population and setting in which the models are applied. For example, the needs and outcomes for families with a chronic condition who experience long hospital stays may differ from those of families of a previously healthy young child who is admitted for a treatment procedure. Also, older children may have a greater awareness and understanding of the reasons for their hospitalisation. Therefore, models of care may reflect increased participation of the child in their hospital care. However, even if the processes of family-centred care are seen as making a difference and advantageous in their own right, reliable reassurance that they result in more good than harm should be sought. Currently there is limited systematic information on how these principles have underpinned changes in healthcare practice and service delivery when a child is hospitalised, and the effect of family-centred approaches on child and family outcomes and health service delivery.20 Several systematic reviews have been conducted on the effectiveness of family centred care but very few studies have met the inclusion criteria. Consequently no conclusions could be drawn from these reviews. Shields, et al.1 conducted a Cochrane review of the effectiveness of family-centred care including randomised control trials, before and after and cohort studies from 1960 to 2004. An update of the Cochrane review was also undertaken by Shields, et al.2 in 2012 which examined randomised control trials only from 2004 to December 2011. Furthermore, Shields, et al.36 conducted a systematic review of quasi-experimental studies on the topic published between 2004 and December 2011. A literature review by Shields37 on the topic examined qualitative studies published between 1990 and 2004. Eleven research articles were included in the review. Three main themes emerged: role negotiation, parental expectation of participation in their child's care, and issues relating to power and control. The findings revealed that family-centred models of care were influenced by negotiation between staff and families, and roles of both parents and staff within interactions that took place in hospital during a child's admission. Corlett and Twycross38 also reviewed evidence on the negation of parental roles within family-centred care. The results revealed that family participation in their child's care hindered by nurses' lack of communication and limited negotiation. Nurses did not routinely negotiate with parents even though nurses had clear ideas on what nursing care parents could be involved in. In addition, Coyne39 conducted a review of both research and literature from 1993 to 2007 on children's participation at the health service level. It was found that children were rarely involved in decision-making process and their views were rarely sought nor acknowledged. To date, there is no formal systematic review on the qualitative evidence of family-centred models of care. This systematic review aims to examine any qualitative studies from 2004 to December 2012 that address the experiences and /or perceptions related to family-centred care by families and/or health care providers. Inclusion criteria This review will consider studies that include hospitalised children aged 0-12 years (but excluding premature neonates), their family and/or health providers. Definitions: Child/children: throughout this review, the term ‘child’ or ‘children’ is used to include all newborn infants, babies and children up to the age of 12 years being cared for in hospital; and all parts of hospitals that provide a service to children. The definitions of childhood can vary, and age limits are arbitrary. For the purpose of this review the National Library of Medicine's medical subject headings were used to define the age cut off of 12 years. However, we have excluded neonates born prematurely and who are patients in a neonatal intensive or special care nursery, as their requirements for family-centred care, and the ethics and philosophies of care around this particular group, are different to those in a ward/unit where full term infants and children are nursed.40 We have excluded studies about adolescents for similar reasons. Families: throughout the review the following definition of the family will be applied: The family is a basic social unit having as its nucleus two or more persons, irrespective of age, in which each of the following conditions are present: the members are related by blood, or marriage, or adoption, or by a contract which is either explicit or implied; the members communicate with each other in terms of defined social roles such as mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, son, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt; and they adopt or create and maintain common customs and traditions. This definition has been modified from Nixon's original definition41 to allow for inclusion of significant others who do not usually cohabit with the family. Healthcare providers involved in caring for hospitalised children. For the purposes of the review, a healthcare provider will be used to describe any health professional involved in the care of hospitalised children. Phenomenon of interest The review will consider studies that investigate family and/or health providers' experience of family-centred models of care for hospitalised children. Only studies that provide clear evidence that the family and/or child were actively involved in the planning and/or delivery of health care during the child's hospitalisation will be considered for inclusion. For the purposes of the review, the minimum criteria for active involvement included evidence of collaboration between health carers and the family and/or child in the planning and/or delivery of care as soon as possible after admission or during the preadmission period. The elements of family centred care can be grouped into three clusters as follows:5 Family as a constant Culturally responsive Supporting family individuality. ‘Family as a constant’ can be evidenced by: Recognising family strengths Parent/professional collaboration Needs-based family support Flexible provision of health care Sharing information with families. Examples of how the family centred care model can be ‘culturally responsive’ include, but are not confined to, the family receiving culturally competent health care and respect being shown for family diversity. ‘Supporting family individuality and need for different types of family support’ can be demonstrated by: Respecting family coping methods Providing emotional support Family-to-family support Attending to developmental needs of the child and family. Further details are contained in Appendix I. Exclusions: Facilitating parent-to-parent support studies where there is no clear evidence of collaboration between the family and/or child and health care provider in the planning and/or delivery of care will be excluded. Such studies would include parental presence during health care procedures such as routine examinations, anaesthetic induction, venepuncture and post-anaesthetic recovery or bereavement team/protocols. Parental presence on these occasions without any framework of ongoing collaboration, communication, etc. does not meet the holistic principles on which family-centred care is based. Types of Outcomes This review will consider studies that include but are not confined to the following outcome measures: Experience of family-centred care models of care from family and/or health providers: clarity of role expectations nature of relationships between family and health care providers parental comfort with the extent of their degree of involvement in child's care content, consistency, timeliness, understandableness and degree to which information provided meets parent's needs family members' stress and anxiety levels adequacy of facilities for family's needs health care providers' support for the collaborative model of care adequacy of health care providers' knowledge and skills, and available time to implement family centred care. Perceptions of family-centred care models of care by family and/or health providers: how the experience is viewed degree to which expectations are being or have been met degree to which the model of care has been individualised to meet specific needs of families degree to which the model of care is implementable in actual operating contexts degree to which health care providers are committed to the model's implementation. Types of studies The review will consider qualitative studies. This includes, but is not limited to, designs such as phenomenology and grounded theory. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. There will be no limitation by publication language and databases will be searched from inception to date. A three-step search strategy will be utilised in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. The databases to be searched include: Medline CINAHL Embase PsycINFO CSA Sociological Abstracts The search for unpublished studies will include: Web of Science Conference Proceedings Australian Research Online UK Clinical Research Network: Portfolio Database Bandolier Google MedNar Initial keywords to be used will be: child/children, parent/s, health services, family centered care/family centred care Assessment of family-centredness To begin with, we will screen all potential studies for family-centredness. In order to assess relevant studies for the degree of family-centredness, this review will utilise a modified rating scale based on that developed by Trivette5 (Appendix I). These authors used the 9 elements of family-centred care, as described by the Association for the Care of Children's Health, to develop 13 evaluation items that describe the features of family-centred care. These sub-elements are further grouped into three cluster groups (Cluster 1: family as a constant; Cluster 2: culturally responsive; Cluster 3: supporting family individuality) derived from an original cluster analysis by Trivette.5 The clusters were designed to be used to help describe the model of family-centred care for individual research studies. A rating of 0 to 4 will be applied to each of the 13 sub-elements of family-centred care, as follows: 0. Article includes no evidence that the intervention either implicitly or explicitly was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 1. Article includes a minimal amount of implicit evidence that the intervention was based on the elements of family-centred care. 2. Article includes numerous instances of implicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 3. Article includes a minimal amount of explicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. 4. Article includes numerous instances of explicit evidence that the intervention was based upon the elements of family-centred care. The maximum possible score is 52. Two reviewers will independently score the study against Family Centredness Score Form (Appendix I). The scores from the two reviewers will be averaged as the final score for the study. One of three ‘degrees of family-centredness’ will be assigned to each study assessed: A study with a score of 42 or more from a possible total of 52 (80%) will be considered as having a “high degree of family-centredness”, Those studies scoring between 50% and 80% will be classified as having a “moderate degree of family-centredness”, Those studies scoring below 50% will be classified as having a “low degree of family-centredness”. Those studies with a family-centeredness score of less than 50% will be excluded from the study. Assessment of methodological quality Those studies that are classified as having either a high or moderate degree of “family centredness” will then be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) (Appendix II).42 Any disagreements that arise on either instrument - family centeredness or quality of studies - between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. Data collection Qualitative data will be extracted from papers included in the review using the standardised data extraction tool from JBI-QARI(Appendix III).42 The data extracted will include specific details about the populations, study methods and findings of significance to the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Meta-synthesis of the qualitative findings will be undertaken. This involves aggregation or synthesis of the findings to generate a set of statements that represent that aggregation through assembling the findings (Level 1 findings), and categorising the findings based on similarity in meaning (Level 2 findings). These categories are then subjected to a meta-synthesis to produce a single comprehensive set of synthesised findings (Level 3 findings) that can be used as a basis for evidence-based practice.

Constituyen a las (MS) individuos que se autoidentifican como Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales, Transgénero y otras posibilidades (Braun, 2021). Esta minoría conforma la comunidad LGBTIQ+, y a lo largo de la historia ha enfrentado rechazo tanto por parte de la sociedad como de sus propios familiares. Este rechazo ha traído consigo problemas psicológicos y sociales en la comunidad de las MS, que podrían estar relacionados con la falta de apoyo por parte de sus familiares, amigos y la sociedad que los rodea. Las personas cuya identidad no encaja con la dicotomía sexo/género normativo pueden verse afectadas en su salud física, mental, social y sexual debido a la discriminación en una cultura heteronormada. Estas dificultades de adaptación social se dan en todos los ámbitos y áreas de su vida, como educación, empleo, hogar y el uso de los sistemas de salud (Boza y Nicholson, 2014).",

      "title": "Child Abuse In Odisha",
      "abstract": "Everyday many children are becoming the victims of abuse one form or other. Children have limited resources of their own to combat traumatic experiences. Moreover, exposure to “western thinking” has brought about changes in attitudes towards traditional methods of guidance, discipline, and other child-rearing practices (Mullati, 1995; Sinha, 1984, 1988). However, because traditional attitudes have not been completely abandoned, many parents alternate between permissive and strict (authoritarian) child rearing, thus creating anxiety and confusion in children and making them more vulnerable to behavioral or emotional disorders (Bharat, 1997). Many parents unknowingly are abusing their children by using severe punishment and being inconsistent and arbitrary. Some factors contributing to child abuse and neglect include low socio-economic status, illiteracy, malnutrition, cultural customs and taboos, lack of social justice, and gender inequality. Child support is a critical concern for both regional and national policy makers.",

Antisociality is a heterogeneous concept that includes a variety of behaviors, such as fighting, vandalism, concealment, disobedience and irritability. Over the period 2000â€“2016, the number of crimes against children, child welfare registrations and children in foster care increased significantly. Sexual abuse towards children is a prevalent and worrisome social phenomenon, especially among girls. The socioemotional development of the child exposed to domestic violence is disrupted and the socioemotional profile varies according to whether the mother has left the violent partner, and also according to her stress. Family history of psychoactive substance use is a robust risk factor for increased use by adolescents and adults. In the context of socialization, peers come to play an important role, second only to family.",

Nous découvrons souvent des antécédents d’abus sexuels chez des adolescents et des adultes consultant pour des troubles de l’humeur, des conduites addictives ou des troubles de l’identité sexuelle. Ces patients n’ont bénéficié d’aucune prise en charge psychologique car les parents ont « oublié » rapidement cet événement. Ainsi, toute réparation devient impossible : la réparation judiciaire n’a pas été déclenchée, ni celle liée à la reconnaissance par l’entourage familial, du préjudice subi voire du traumatisme. Les réactions des parents sont déterminantes pour encourager ou bloquer le processus de « guérison ». L’enfant « non soutenu », peut développer de la rancune envers ses parents. La demande d’explication reste pendante et va influencer le devenir psychologique de l’adulte qu’il sera, mais également la qualité de ses relations avec ses parents. Le silence de ces derniers est en général sous-tendu par des considérations socioculturelles comme le jugement des autres, la résignation, ou encore la volonté divine.",

      "title": "Premature birth: An Enigma for the Society?",
      "abstract": "Infants born preterm are at greater risk than infants born at term for mortality and a variety of health and developmental problems. Complications include acute respiratory, gastrointestinal, immunologic, central nervous system, hearing, and vision problems, as well as longer-term motor, cognitive, visual, hearing, behavioral, social-emotional, health, and growth problems. The birth of a preterm infant can also bring considerable emotional and economic costs to families and have implications for public-sector services, such as health insurance, educational, and other social support systems. The greatest risk of mortality and morbidity is for those infants born at the earliest gestational ages. However, those infants born nearer to term represent the greatest number of infants born preterm and also experience more complications than infants born at term. Preterm birth is a complex cluster of problems with a set of overlapping factors of influence. Its causes may include individual-level behavioral and psychosocial factors, neighborhood characteristics, environmental exposures, medical conditions, infertility treatments, biological factors and genetics. Many of these factors occur in combination, particularly in those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups. The empirical investigation was carried out to draw correlation between preterm birth and eventuality. This paper deals with various issues related to the premature deliveries from socio-biological perspectives.",

      "title": "Measuring Informal Care: A Synthesis of European Practices and a New Proposal",
      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly shown that a large number of independently living oldest \nelderly are cared for by family members, friends or neighbours. This care is given \neither in combination with professional home care or without and it obviously \nreduces the financial burden for the state’s health and social security system. \nSeveral authors suggest that, although very high levels of informal care are still \npresent in Europe, this pattern will change in the near future. In view of monitoring \nthe trends, we need sound and standardised procedures of measurement. The \npaper deals with the measurement of “informal care”. By “informal care”, we mean \ncare provided by family members, friends and neighbours. Organised voluntary \nwork is not included. \nThe paper first describes sociological and socio-demographic research where \ninformal care is a major theme. The study of (a) intergenerational relations, of (b) \nthe relationship between formal and informal care, and of (c) social capital, \nincluding the analysis of living conditions of informal carers and the study of the \ncombination of “care and career”. We argue that there is a shift in measuring \ninformal carers from the point of view of the care receiver towards the perspective \nof the care provider. \nHowever, looking at the procedures used in counting the proportion of informal \ncarers from the carer’s perspective in European research, a large variety is apparent. \nAny sound international comparison is therefore jeopardised. We describe the \navailable methods in the second section. \nThe paper proceeds with the presentation of a method developed in Belgium \n(Flemish region), in 2003. This method is based on the description of performed \ncare tasks in the field of socio-emotional work, housekeeping and personal care. It \nallows the development of age and gender (and other) specific indicators. \nFurthermore it enables a risk-type analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of this \napproach are discussed.",

In the realm of \"action-driven\" agency, animals experiencing age-related changes, neurological issues, or recovering from injuries may struggle with changes to their mobility. Competence is a higher-order psychological Need of animals. Social interactions can be a major source of caretaker-independent ways for animals to acquire rewards and also to manage their own processes.

The mothers allowed child care responsibilities to have precedence over employment demands in some, but not all of the conflict situations. The mother herself generally managed the situations related to her child's health or attendance at child's important activities. Experience with dual responsibilities, family life cycle stage, and ability to take time off from work for family matters without negative consequences were significant variables in determining whether the mother performed the child care herself or sought assistance.",

In a cross‐sectional sample, parents were found to have more traditional gender‐role stereotypes than nonparents with a wish to have a child and nonparents without the wish to have a child. This suggests that gender‐role stereotypes increase after the transition into parenthood. In a longitudinal sample, parents were followed for 4 years after the first birthday of their youngest child. The authors found that implicit gender‐role stereotypes and behavior became increasingly traditional over time in most parents, except for the following two groups: (a) Fathers with highly traditional gender‐role stereotypes did not show change over time and (b) older, highly educated mothers who worked relatively many hours outside the home and who had an egalitarian task division at home, remained egalitarian in their gender‐role stereotypes over time.",

      "abstract": "Hintergrund Die Lebenswelt von Pflegeheimbewohner*innen mit Demenz beschränkt sich fast ausschließlich auf ihr Zimmer. Dies lässt neben einem geringen Ausmaß an körperlicher Aktivität und kognitiven Stimuli, auch auf mangelnde sozialer Teilhabe in der Alltagswelt von Pflegeheimbewohner*innen mit Demenz schließen. Bislang existieren jedoch lediglich einige wenige Studien, die sich mit sozialer Eingebundenheit und Freundschaften dieser Zielgruppe befassen. Auch wenn es im Pflegeheimalltag scheinbar die Möglichkeit für Bewohner*innen gäbe, miteinander in soziale Interaktion zu treten, ist dies real nicht der Fall: Beobachtungsstudien zeigen, dass sich Bewohner*innen auch wenn sie sich in Gemeinschaftsräumen aufhalten, meist schweigend nebeneinandersitzen und auch im Rahmen von strukturierten Aktivitäten keine Interaktionen zwischen ihnen stattfinden. Somit ist es wenig überraschend, dass nahe Beziehungen zwischen Pflegeheimbewohner*innen selten sind, wenngleich sie diese Freundschaften als im höchsten Maße wichtig für ihre Lebensqualität im Pflegeheim ansehen.",

      "title": "Depression Following Major Life Transitions in Women: A Review and Theory",
      "abstract": "Depression can occur due to common major life transitions, such as giving birth, menopause, retirement, empty-nest transition, and midlife crisis. Although some of these transitions are perceived as positive (e.g., giving birth), they may still lead to depression. We conducted a systematic literature review of the factors underlying the occurrence of depression following major life transition in some individuals. This review shows that major common life transitions can cause depression if they are sudden, major, and lead to loss (or change) of life roles (e.g., no longer doing motherly or fatherly chores after children leave family home). Accordingly, we provide a theoretical framework that explains depression caused by transitions in women. One of the most potential therapeutic methods of ameliorating depression associated with life transitions is either helping individuals accept their new roles (e.g., accepting new role as a mother to ameliorate postpartum depression symptoms) or providing them with novel life roles (e.g., volunteering after retirement or children leave family home) may help them overcome their illness.",

      "abstract": "Using data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Surveys, this study investigated divorced and widowed parents' ( N = 350) decision making about living arrangements after repartnering: Twenty‐eight percent lived apart together ( LAT ) and others lived together (remarried or cohabiting). The focus was on determinants of LAT : Women, older respondents, residents of larger cities, and parents of 2 or more children are more apt to LAT . On the basis of additional qualitative interviews with LAT respondents ( n = 25), the reasons for LAT were investigated. Data showed that many children are involved in pure boundary work in an effort to guarantee the continuation of their family. Other (step)children use the sabotage or refusal types of boundary work, not accepting the new partner or excluding a parent from contact, especially with grandchildren. Many of these efforts are successful. To preserve the ties with their children, parents often adapt their decision making about the living arrangements with a new partner accordingly .",

When the family as a whole is engaged in healthy behaviors, all the individual members are more likely to be in good physical health. The health of the family as a functional unit is influenced by the family's cohesion, flexibility, and communication (as shown by the circumplex model of family systems). Breakdowns in any of these areas can affect both physical and mental health. A family's reaction to a stressful event such as a health diagnosis can lead to improvement or crisis for the individuals and the family (as shown by the ABC‐X model of family stress). External sociocultural factors also impact the health of families, including social support, socioeconomic or minority status, and community resources. The patient‐centered medical home model and the community‐based participatory research model are emerging frameworks for healthcare and research that recognize the embeddedness of the individual in the family.",

To answer this question I develop a dynamic framework of ideological transmission in families in which parents are biased towards children’s traits and socioeconomic activities are modeled in the shape of a trust‐matching process. I model how children are educated to a specific ideological trait that later in life will influence the well‐being of the family. Compared to the existing literature, my model yields two new results. First, paternalistic preferences in children’s education at time t are a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure the preservation of heterogeneity in the long‐run distribution of traits. Second, my model is able to reproduce historical events in which a reversal of parents’ evaluation of traits has been observed. Assuming myopic agents does not change the qualitative results of the model.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Determining custody arrangements for children when parents have separated or divorced is becoming a commonplace experience in the west, especially in English‐speaking countries. In general, the guiding principle in family law for the determination of postseparation arrangements for children is that of the “best interests of the child.” The current understanding of this principle stresses the importance of the ongoing involvement of both biological parents in their children's lives. Hence, joint legal custody has become normative, as has regular and frequent contact, if not equal shared care. However, the emphasis given to the quantity of time in debates over residence and contact can detract attention from more important issues, like the quality of parenting children receive; their exposure to conflict, violence, and/or abuse; and children's developmental needs. Issues raised by social parents and wider kin have also been largely neglected.",

      "title": "JAPANESE PSYCHOLOGY THROUGH JAPANESE LITERATURE",
      "abstract": "Few studies of personality and culture pay heed to the development of individuals after they have come of age. Most empirical research focuses upon what happens to children and youth on their way to becoming adults. And the whole vocabulary of the field is built around a notion of “doing to” persons in a junior position, in order to “socialize” or “enculturate” them. Child training, for example, is investigated in terms of what happens to children but not in terms of its effect upon their parents. This child-centered bias means that the usual personality and culture models are of little help when one seeks to understand normal growth in relatively self-aware and self-directing adults. A curve of standard stages of psychogenesis may be useful when studying infants. Adult development, however, can be better understood as a web of interpersonal contingencies of change. Two important features of this are: a) an adult's awareness of career pathways, stages, and potentials; and b) an adult's obligation to care for others in a circle of consociates—Erikson's notion of “generativity” seen in wider compass. I sketch an interpersonal approach to adult development, and illustrate portions of it by analyzing the best-selling Japanese novel of 1972, A Man in Ecstasy.",

Durante este proceso, ellos deben enfrentar una serie de cambios en su entorno, como la alteración de las rutinas familiares, el desequilibrio emocional de los padres y la pérdida total o parcial de la relación con un progenitor. El nivel de estrés que experimentan depende de las características personales de cada niño, y de cómo los padres y otros adultos significativos manejen la situación, especialmente durante el primer tiempo del proceso de separación. Los niños preescolares tienen una fuente adicional de ansiedad, debido a que poseen un pensamiento transductivo, egocéntrico y causalista mágico, que les&#x0D; lleva a construir fantasías de abandono y daño, y explicaciones donde se autoculpan por lo que ocurre en la familia. Por esta razón, se destaca la necesidad de apoyarlos emocionalmente y facilitar una comunicación fluida que los clarifique, tanto con los padres en la familia como en su Jardín Infantil. Un enfoque preventivo de las dificultades en el desarrollo de los niños preescolares involucra necesariamente a las educadoras de nivel prebásico, cuyo rol fundamental es, por un lado, contenerlos emocionalmente; y por otro, proveerles un ambiente estable, consistente y predecible, que les permita experimentar seguridad y un sentido de control sobre su entorno, que no tienen en sus hogares.

Se parte de una perspectiva ecológica-sistémica y de los modelos teóricos sistémicos de la aculturación por ser enfoques claves en la comprensión del fenómeno. Metodología. Se ha utilizado una metodología cualitativa. Se realizaron tres grupos de entrevistas en profundidad a nueve padres y madres migrantes con al menos un hijo/a menor de doce años residiendo con ellos en Canarias, procedentes de Cuba, Venezuela y Colombia, usuarios/as de servicios comunitarios (ONG y Servicios Sociales de base) de Tenerife. Resultados. Los resultados han revelado la presencia de tres constructos principales en el discurso: la familia, los sistemas formales de apoyo y el ajuste cultural divididos en once temas. En la familia, se destacan diferencias en las pautas educativas, considerándose estrictos y rígidos en la educación de sus hijos/as, problemas de conciliación de la vida laboral y familiar, desempleo, precariedad económica y vivienda, necesidad de regular su situación administrativa, falta de apoyos informales (e.g. de la familia extensa) y la resiliencia familiar adquirida tras la migración. En los apoyos formales de sanidad, educación, servicios sociales y comunitarios perciben barreras de acceso, pero buena calidad en la atención tanto para ellos como para sus hijos e hijas. Finalmente, se ha constatado el choque cultural en las figuras parentales, la socialización bicultural en los hijos e hijas y la sensación de seguridad del entorno en el país de acogida. Discusión. Se manifiesta en el discurso la relación de interdependencia e influencia bidireccional que existe entre los sistemas y el proceso de aculturación. Se confirma que la experiencia migratoria produce modificaciones en el sistema familiar, la relevancia de las redes apoyos institucionales en su bienestar social y los ajustes culturales de los progenitores como de sus hijos/as para la adaptación de ambas culturas. Conclusiones. Se destacan cambios en el ejercicio parental en los distintos sistemas tras la migración, la necesidad de mejoras en la implicación institucional y el apoyo profesional a las familias migrantes en su función parental tras experimentar un proceso migratorio, destacándose para ello el papel fundamental del Trabajo Social.",

In this investigation, 210 participants (71 men and 139 women) read typeset obituaries describing the suicidal death of an 18-year-old young man or young woman. Survivors were described as mother and father, father and stepmother, or mother and stepfather. Ratings (derived from previous studies of the social perception of survivors) were obtained to reflect the impressions participants had of the stepparents. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated a main effect for status of parents (i.e., stepparents versus biological parents). Although there were no reliable differences on several items, stepparents were viewed as having been less “close” to the young person, as taking less time to “recover psychologically” from the loss, and stepmothers were rated as less “likable.” These findings suggest that even in situations (i.e., the suicidal death of a child) where social perceptions are likely to be more negative toward any bereaved parent, stepparents may face an additional burden of negative social perception.",

A family-centered framework for evaluating these policies and practices can provide direction that will help reduce these tensions.

School refusal covers a very heterogeneous set of problems ranging from refusal of schooling - in terms of engagement in learning or in situations of evaluation, in relation to knowledge - to school phobia or anxious school refusal. Furthermore, the clinical form of children and adolescents refusing school is determined by a wide range of factors - individual, family, school and cultural - that interact with each other and change over time. In the context of a multidimensional approach, the apprehension of school refusal involves a dialogue between the family, health professionals and the various players in national education. This approach makes it possible to think about the developmental trajectory of the child and lead to the establishment of a personalized care project.Refus scolaire. Le refus scolaire recouvre un ensemble très hétérogène de problématiques allant du refus de la scolarité – en termes d’engagement dans les apprentissages ou dans les situations d’évaluation, de rapport au savoir – à la phobie scolaire ou refus scolaire anxieux.

Parents are an important member of the family system, and their parental child-rearing gender-role attitudes (PCGA) will have a significant impact on their children’s social adjustment. This study used a sampling method to compare the intergenerational differences between family members’ PCGA, identity with parents and social adjustment in single- and two-parent families through 931 single-parent families and 3732 two-parent families in Suzhou, China. The study explored the mediating role of children’s identity with parents on parents’ PCGA and children’s social adjustment in different family structures. The results showed that: (1) parents’ masculinity rearing, femininity rearing of PCGA and children’s social adjustment in two-parent families were significantly higher than those in single-parent families; (2) children’s identity with parents mediated the relationship between femininity rearing of parents’ PCGA and children’s social adjustment; (3) the mediated model of children’s identity with parents was found to be significantly different between single-parent and two-parent families.",

      "title": "Differential Effects of Pet Presence and Pet-Bonding on Young Children",
      "abstract": "Pets have been shown to influence human development, but whether the effect is due to the presence of a pet or to the person's relationship with a pet is uncertain. Mothers rated their young children's companion animal bond (relationship) and social competence on a parental questionnaire, and a researcher assessed the children's empathy, cooperation, and intelligence during home visits. Significant correlations were noted between the children's bonds with their companion animals and their scores on the social competency scales as well as their empathy scores. The lack of similar significant pet presence (“ownership”) correlations supports the hypothesis that the children's relationships with their pets are more important than just the presence of one or more pets in their homes.",

Cela peut engendrer une perte de confiance en soi et une baisse de l’estime de soi qui peut s’averer etre un obstacle en ce qui concerne la reinsertion sociale et professionnelle. En parallele, les professionnels exercant aupres de ce public rencontrent des difficultes dues a un nombre de SDF qui ne cesse d’augmenter et a un manque de Centres d’ Hebergement d’Urgence (CHU). Le travail fait avec ce public peut etre parfois difficile car ils sont confrontes a plusieurs problematique : sante, logement, social… Ce qui m’amene a m’interroger sur les pratiques professionnelles qui sont mises en avant aupres de ce public pour permettre l’evolution du sentiment d’exclusion tout en favorisant la reinsertion sociale et professionnelle. \r\nJe m’interroge donc sur: Les pratiques professionnelles peuvent-elles faire evoluer le sentiment d’exclusion des SDF ? Si oui comment ? Ce changement permet-il alors leur reinsertion sociale et professionnelle ?",

      "abstract": "An understanding of social factors that create the diversity among caregivers and the implications of the diversity for meeting caregivers' needs are critical for practitioners charged with developing and implementing support services. There is a general consensus within the literature that one family member serves as the primary source of care for an impaired elderly person although others in the family and friend network may serve as \"secondary caregivers\". Spouses and adult children who are primary caregivers also differ in the way they share care responsibilities with other family members who may participate in the caregiving process as backup or secondary sources of care. The sex of the caregivers involved tends to be associated with the patterns of care sharing. The differences in care constellations between families with spouse primary caregivers vs. adult-children likely account for cultural differences that have been observed in care patterns and use of support services.",

      "abstract": "Eine kindergerechte Sicherheitspolitik muss die Rechte und Beduerfnisse der Kinder beruecksichtigen, sie muss ihre gesunde Entwicklung foerdern und darf diese nicht behindern. Der Rueckgang der Kinderunfaelle ist auf einen deutlichen Rueckgang bei den fuenf- bis neunjaehrigen Kindern beschraenkt und dies nur, wenn sie zu Fuss gehen. Bei den anderen Altersgruppen und Mobilitaetsarten blieb die Anzahl der Unfaelle mehr oder weniger konstant. Die Wirksamkeit der bisherigen Massnahmen ist mehr als fraglich. Die eigentliche Ursache des Rueckgangs wird verschwiegen: Juengere Kinder werden nicht mehr alleine auf die gelassen, der motorisierte Strassenverkehr hat die Kinder aus dem urspruenglichen Lebensraum Strasse vertrieben. Verschiedene Beispiele fuer die bewusste Vertreibung durch verkehrstechnische und gesetzliche Massnahmen werden geschildert (Gestaltung von Knotenpunkten als Kreisverkehre anstelle ampelgesicherter Uebergaenge, Aufhebung von Fussgaengerstreifen, vermehrter Druck auf die Verantwortlichen zur Beaufsichtigung der Kinder im Strassenverkehr). Unter dem Vorwand der Unfallvermeidung wird eine Verhinderungs- und Vertreibungspolitik betrieben. Weitere Beispiele zeigen, wie ungeschickt Verkehrssicherheitsgremien Kinderinteressen wahrnehmen und vertreten (Einkleidung von Kindern mit Werbemitteln, Abschiebung von Verantwortung fuer die Sicherheit der Kinder auf die Eltern). Kinder, die in durch den Strassenverkehr gefaehrdeten Wohnumfeldern aufwachsen, weisen bereits mit fuenf Jahren deutliche Defizite auf in Bezug auf ihre motorische und soziale Entwicklung und auf ihre Selbststaendigkeit. Der Strassenverkehr muss den Kindern jenen Raum zur Verfuegung stellen, den sie fuer eine gesunde Entwicklung brauchen. Wohngebiete muessen grundsaetzlich in Tempo-30-Zonen integriert werden. Ein fein veraesteltes Netz von Fusswegen und Trampelpfaden muss die verschiedenen Begegnungszonen miteinander verbinden. Das am 1. September 2005 in der Schweiz gegruendete Netzwerk Kind und Verkehr betrachtet als wichtigstes Ziel, ein fuer Kinder gesundes Lebensumfeld durchzusetzen. Gemeinsam mit den uebrigen zustaendigen Organisationen soll ein Weg zur Realisierung einer kindgerechten Sicherheitspolitik gesucht werden.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades significant changes in terms of relationships and family took place. Beck and Beck-Gernsheim argue that individuals increasingly shape their own biography and that who belongs to the family and who does not, in an individualized society has become an individual choice of the family members. An example of a late modern family with elective affinities is a single parent foster family, where singles choose to take in a child that they have no biological relation with. In the literature, this specific family form is only discussed to a limited extent. In this exploratory, qualitative study fourteen single foster mothers are asked about their experiences as single foster parents and how they deal with the challenges of foster parenting through in-depth interviews. Three areas of tension were found: the tension between self-centered motives to foster and the perception of foster care as a social engagement, the tension between the temporary nature of foster care and the extent to which the foster parents attach to their foster child and the tension between the private aspect of foster care and its institutional side. These experiences of tension and the ways in which two different, identified types of respondents deal with them are discussed by means of the theoretical framework of elective affinities of Beck-Gernsheim.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the dynamics of custodial conflicts is important for reducing the level of such conflicts and improving the upbringing conditions for the children involved. The parents in these cases care for children living in two households, and our approach therefore draws on the knowledge of how ‘ordinary’ parents proceed in sharing care within and between locations. The paper is based on qualitative interviews with 15 Norwegian parents who were in contact with the child protection service during their custodial disagreements, indicating a high level of conflict and concerns about inadequate care. When describing and reflecting upon their practices of care, the parents speak from two main positions: as a concerned parent or an accused parent. These positions imply different approaches on how to share care, which offer insight into the mechanisms of getting stuck. Although the concerned parent worries about the child's well‐being while staying with the other parent and thereby aims to take a continuous responsibility across households, the accused parent perceives the co‐parent's involvement as undue and negotiates increased distance in parenting. Focusing on practices of care may contribute to turning the attention away from conflicts between former partners and towards the child's situation.",

Likewise, divorced families also are viewed more negatively than intact families. To see whether a combination of suicide plus divorce led adolescents have particularly negative views, 120 high school students read one of four versions of a newspaper article about a teen!s death. The teen was described as having lived either with both parents (I) or with his divorced mother (D), and as having died either from a rare disease (VI) or by suicide (S). As compared to VI teens and their parents, D teens and their parents were seen as more psychologically disturbed; and S parents were seen as more (a) to blame, (b) sad and depressed, (c) ashamed, and (d) in need of professional psychological help. As compared to I teens and their parents, D teens and their parents were seen as more psychologically disturbed, and, in the case of fathers, more unlikeable. Surprisingly, these students expected to have less trouble expressing sympathy to divorced parents than to intact parents. However, a combination of divorce and suicide did not exacerbate the negative perceptions and anticipated reactions of these high school students.",

Se realizaron entrevistas en profundidad empleando análisis de contenido y se definieron las siguientes categorías de investigación: motivaciones, dificultades, emociones del cuidador, postergación por el bien del otro, redes de apoyo familiares, emociones asociadas al diagnóstico, religión, institucionalización, expectativas de cuidado de enfermería, acceso a beneficios del estado y muerte. Los resultados muestran que la mayoría de los cuidadores son mujeres, sin apoyo familiar, que tienen un vínculo sentimental con la persona cuidada, y que sus motivaciones para desempeñar esta labor son el cariño y la obligación. Se observó postergación por parte del cuidador dedicándose por completo a esta labor, abandonando actividades ajenas al cuidado y experimentando sobrecarga acompañada de limitaciones económicas debido a los bajos ingresos que reciben.",

      "title": "Motivation for Money and Care that Adult Children Provide for Parents: Evidence from 'Point-Blank' Survey Questions",
      "abstract": "When adult children provide care for their aging parents, they often do so at great expense to themselves incurring psychic, monetary, emotional, and even physical costs, in conjunction with care that is labor intensive and, at the extreme, unrelenting. While the nature of parent care and the profile of care giving children are well described in the literatures of the social sciences, we still lack insight into why adult children undertake parent care without compensation or compulsion. In this paper, we adopt a novel, direct question approach using newly available data from a special module fielded in the 2000 Health and Retirement Study that included questions on motivations for, and concerns with, the provision of familial assistance. Transfers are not always provided free of pressure from other family members, for example, and familial norms of obligations and traditions appear to matter for many respondents. These findings suggest that the standard set of economic considerations - utility interdependence, budget constraints, exchange, and the like - are insufficient for a complete understanding of private transfer behavior. Though one must always be skeptical about reading too much into what people say about why they do the things they do (or think they will do) we nonetheless conclude that point-blank questions offer, at the very least, a worthwhile complement to the more conventional methods for unraveling motivations for private, intergenerational transfers.",

A total of 1,078 adolescents/young adults (459 males and 619 females) participated. We found a curvilinear pattern in the bond between daughters and their parents. For most of the boys, there was a deterioration in the parental bond during the transition from early to midadolescence, which does not subsequently improve. The general conclusion, however, is that adolescents and young adults maintain a rather good and reasonably stable relationship with their parents. Parents prove to be of lasting importance for the well-being of their growing children. For adult children, the parental bond appears to be as important for their well-being as having a partner or a best friend.",

      "title": "THE NEED FOR FAMILY-CENTERED HOME CARE IN HOME-BASED DEMENTIA CARE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Family caregivers, paid caregivers, and geriatricians frequently work together to care for people with dementia living at home, yet little is known about the paid caregiver role in home-based dementia care. We conducted repeated, one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with the care team (i.e., family caregiver, paid caregiver, geriatrician) of 9 people living at home with dementia over 6 months to explore multiple perspectives on paid caregivers’ role in care over time. In all, 29 unique respondents participated in 75 interviews that were analyzed using the framework method of analysis. Results revealed nuanced and highly individual care arrangements where paid caregiver roles in care varied significantly, though changes to this role over time were minimal. Families were the key players in defining the paid caregivers’ role regardless of home care agency involvement or source of paid caregiver payment (i.e., Medicaid-funded vs. privately paid) and geriatricians frequently deferred to family caregivers to determine how they should engage with paid caregivers. While paid caregivers often described their emotional connection to their clients, family caregivers and geriatricians rarely described this as an important aspect of paid care. To meet the nuanced care needs of people with dementia, home care needs to be centered around the unique needs of both people with dementia and their family caregivers. Rather than provide prescriptive standards for home care, family-centered home care should facilitate improved communication and clear expectation setting to be sure that care best meets the unique care needs of people with dementia living at home.",

      "abstract": "N’existe-t-il aucune limite aux formes des systèmes sociaux que les animaux peuvent produire pour s’adapter à leur environnement, ou bien des contraintes définissent-elles l’espace des possibles, restreignant les systèmes sociaux à un nombre fini de formes ? L’étude des sociétés de macaques révèle qu’elles sont constituées par un ensemble de traits covariants. Le niveau d’asymétrie des conflits, l’intensité de l’agression, la fréquence des réconciliations, le degré de permissivité de la mère, l’importance des liens de parenté ou le tempérament individuel varient de manière corrélée d’une espèce à l’autre. Le couplage des traits comportementaux à différents niveaux du génotype et du phénotype a pour effet de circonscrire les macaques à un nombre limité de styles sociaux. Ceux-ci s’ordonnent sur une échelle à quatre degrés allant d’espèces caractérisées par des relations sociales intolérantes et de strictes hiérarchies, à d’autres dont les sociétés sont plus tolérantes et les rapports de dominance moins inégaux. Les différences interspécifiques observées dans le style social des macaques ne s’expliquent pas par des variations du milieu. En revanche, l’échelle de tolérance sociale montre une forte corrélation avec la phylogenèse des macaques, ce qui révèle que le coeur du système d’interconnexions particulier à chaque espèce n’a pas été modifié depuis plusieurs centaines de milliers d’années. Ces résultats nous apprennent que les liaisons entre traits comportementaux agissent comme des contraintes qui limitent la réponse évolutive des systèmes sociaux aux pressions écologiques. Résumé",

      "abstract": "For a long time, care for preterm newborn infants admitted to a neonatal unit was restricted only to the hospital staff.Fathers and mothers were visitors that had restricted hours and no autonomy over their child.Over the past few decades, newborns have had a greater chance for survival in neonatal units.As such, the negative impact of restricted parental care on establishing the bond between parents and children and its consequences, such as abandonment, abuse and neglect, has been identified. 1 Given this evidence, changes have been devised and Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) around the world have begun to open their doors to parents.However, in effect, this stimulus has mainly centered on mothers' participation.Historically, men have been excluded from childbirth and even from providing childcare and being a paternal figure, which is strongly linked to family support.However, two interconnected movements have relativized this issue: new family and gender arrangements, with a social demand for contemporary parents to exercise a more implicit and active role in parenting with regard to living with and caring for their children, and changes in health services. 2n Brazil in recent years, fathers' participation has been stimulated.Some examples include the Companion Law, which, although not specific to the father, opened up the possibility of having him present with his wife in pre-delivery, childbirth and the postpartum period; 2 GM Ordinance No. 930, which regulates neonatal hospitalization in Brazil and included the participation and protagonism of both parents in the care of hospitalized children, guaranteeing them free access and the ability to stay permanently with their child; 3 the partner's prenatal preparation, an essential strategy to give attention to pregnancy, childbirth and birth; 4 paternity leave, which has been re-discussed and extended; and the Kangaroo Method, which includes strategies aimed at the pregnant couple and the effective participation of the father in the child's hospitalization, including the kangaroo position, which has been shown to be advantageous in improving neonatal outcomes. 5hen a baby faces neonatal hospitalization, the father, in general, is the first one to ask for news, and the team does not always welcome him and encourage his participation.In this issue of the Revista Paulista de Pediatria, Soares et al. 6 discuss this issue.This important article presents multi-professional teams' perceptions and demonstrates that there are still disagreements among them.For some, the role of the father is as a provider and not as a caregiver.For others, fathers' participation should involve putting the child in a kangaroo position, changing diapers, giving the child a bath, and supporting the mother in breastfeeding.Giving voice to these professionals enables reflections on NICU practices and denotes that urgent changes need to take place.Teams committed to good clinical practice need to effectively include fathers in neonatal care as a human right, not just as a benefit for the child and the mother.",

A pesar de que Espana es un pais donde las tasas de divorcios han permanecido bajas en comparacion con otros paises europeos, en Cataluna, mas de un 13% de adolescentes de entre doce y dieciseis anos viven en un hogar monoparental. A este dato, hay que anadir otro 6% de hijos que residen con un solo progenitor y su nueva pareja (hogar reconstituido). La tendencia indica que, en los proximos anos, un mayor numero acabara residiendo en algun momento solo con la madre o tambien con su nueva pareja. Este articulo explora el papel del padre no residente en el hogar como proveedor de cuidados, apoyo economico y educativo despues de una ruptura conyugal. La investigacion previa ha relacionado la ausencia del padre biologico con niveles mas altos de angustia emocional, desvinculacion escolar y con un aumento en indice de delincuencia. A partir de una explotacion especifica de datos del Panel de Familias e Infancia, nuestra investigacion explora la frecuencia y la calidad de la interaccion entre los adolescentes y su padre no residente en el hogar habitual de los hijos. Trabajamos con una muestra de 521 adolescentes que viven en hogares monoparentales o reconstituidos (con su madre) y que fueron entrevistados en la primera ola de la encuesta (2006). Basados en analisis estadisticos, nuestros resultados muestran que el apoyo paterno tiene una influencia positiva en los resultados educativos de los adolescentes, ademas de otras influencias, cuando los vinculos se mantienen fuertes a pesar de vivir en hogares diferentes.",

In layman's terms parental alienation syndrome can be described as a mental disorder or condition where children are turned against one parent (the alienated parent) by the other parent (the alienating parent). This occurs primarily as a result of bitter divorce proceedings or in any lawsuit or dispute over parental responsibilities and rights. The purpose of this note is to explain what parental alienation syndrome entails, to discuss the recognition of this syndrome as a mental disorder or condition, and especially to indicate where and when the syndrome can occur in legal matters. The note also aims at creating an awareness of parental alienation syndrome, particularly among family advocates, social workers, lawyers and mediators. The best interests of the child as well the child's voice in divorce proceedings are discussed. The importance of divorce mediation is emphasised and an approach conducive to the conciliation and problem-solving in all matters concerning children, especially in divorce proceedings, are highlighted.",

      "title": "Zwischen Sorgerecht und Unterhaltspflicht",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, some fathers find themselves in an inconsistent situation. On the one hand, demographic changes have caused a re-definition of men s role within families who are no longer exclusively considered as providers. From a new kind of active father a family orientated, child centred attitude, a higher allocation of time towards and a more intense contact with their children is expected as well as wanted. Simultaneously, the emerging social change inter alia expressed in increasing divorce rates leads to an augmenting number of families characterised by absent fathers due to parental break-up. Thus, both developments increasing expectations towards and from fathers as well as decreasing time spend with their children within one household create an inconsistent situation for absent fathers. Studies on non-resident fathering show different individual strategies to cope with this contradiction. Despite a growing debate about post-separation families, so far, little is known about the actual non-resident fathering and its variation. The following research questions are yet to be answered: Which form and extent has fathering in terms of care and cash within post-separated families from fathers own perspective? How based on which economical, socio-demographic and institutional determinants - can the variations in non-resident fathering be explained? Answering the research question the focus lies on non-resident fathers in different contexts. The secondary analysis of three independently developed studies from Germany, Great Britain and Norway follows the principle of parallel demonstration of theory . That is, from a Rational Choice-approach different hypotheses about determinants of non-resident fathering are generally derived. These are tested on the empirical material of each nation. The research findings show a rather different form and extend of fathering for German, British and Norwegian separated fathers. This holds true for the care as well as the cash dimension. Each model of explanation shows varying determinants. Overall, the social-emotional fathering depends highly on the relationship between the parents before, during and after separation. Further, the fathers caring is determined by the distance between the parents home and the parents new partnership situation. The cash aspects cannot as easily be explained by the applied theoretical model. Findings have to be characterized as rather nationally heterogeneous. German fathers paying moral is based on their economical situation as well as by negotiation processes of maintenance. In Great Britain and Norway the explanation of maintenance practices is more complex. Other determinants proof relevance like the amicable relationship between the separated parents in the British case or the extent of contact agreed on between Norwegian parents.",

      "abstract": "La violenza filio-parentale o parental abuse è un comportamento ripetuto di minacce, aggressioni, estorsioni e altre forme di violenza esercitate dai figli nei confronti dei genitori con l'obiettivo di esercitare su di loro un controllo. È difficile valutare la diffusione del fenomeno, che è comunque sicuramente sottostimato e che appare in aumento, anche perché non è riconosciuto in quanto tale. Una ricerca sui fascicoli amministrativi del Tribunale per i minorenni di Milano rileva una prevalenza del 14% di questi comportamenti. La violenza filio-parentale in quanto tale o primaria non è direttamente riconducibile a una psicopatologia del figlio o a esperienze pregresse di abuso, ma va piuttosto inquadrata in una dinamica dei ruoli famigliari, all'interno del contesto socioculturale attuale. È necessaria un'attenta riflessione psicosociale e clinica sulla violenza filio-parentale che eviti di assimilarle ogni rivendicazione di autonomia degli adolescenti o di ridurla esclusivamente a un disturbo del figlio o a una carenza d'autorità dei genitori, tutte prospettive che possono rischiare di avere un effetto iatrogeno. Per un intervento efficace è necessario prendere in considerazione la dinamica dei ruoli affettivi famigliari e il sistema di aspettative o proiezioni reciproche nel quadro della regolazione dei bisogni evolutivi dei figli adolescenti.",

Truth-telling, or the act of disclosing factual information to patients and/or their families, is common practice in western societies and is largely related to an emphasis on respect for patient autonomy. In pediatrics, the relationship between the family and physician is often complex with multiple facets contributing to how and what information is communicated. The family often becomes the gate keeper to what information their child knows. This dynamic becomes more complex when the child transitions to adolescence and young adulthood, where the patient’s autonomy comes in conflict with that of the parents. In addition, truth-telling is not a globally accepted practice with many factors, including culture, religion, personal beliefs, and family dynamics playing a role. This can lead to conflicts between the family and the health care team who hold to the societal norms of truth telling and respect for individual autonomy. We will begin this session with a case report of a young adult with metastatic cancer being treated in a pediatric institution for whom truth-telling was resisted by the parents. We will then review the literature regarding truth-telling and disclosing prognosis to children and young adults, followed by an ethical analysis of truth-telling and how it applies to our case. Finally, we will end with a discussion of strategies health care providers can use to assess the appropriateness of truth-telling in individual cases, as well as methods for talking with children and young adults about death.",

Kinship care is among the fastest growing forms of formal and informal out-of-home care in Australia and is the preferred option for formal out-of-home care in Australia. Kinship care is defined as ‘family-based care within the child’s extended family or with close friends of the family known to the child, whether formal or informal in nature’ (United Nations General Assembly, 2010). There is common agreement that formal kinship care occurs in the instance where children have been placed with kin following some form of statutory (e.g., child protection services) intervention or court-ordered placement.",

      "title": "FAMILY ORIGINS OF VIOLENT DELINQUENTS*",
      "abstract": "Family is central to contemporary theories of delinquent and violent behavior. Yet, the processes by which families shape violent behavior in their children are not well understood. In the past, structural views posited that a weak family exposed a child to the evils of the street. More recently, functionalists have suggested that the family plays an active role in socializing youths to violent behaviors through supervision and discipline practices and modeling and reinforcement of antisocial behaviors. Integrated theories presume that socially disorganized families weaken children's conventional bonds and attachments, leading to associations with delinquent peers and in turn antisocial behavior. However, the influence of the family as a socializing environment may shift over time, and some suggest that its influence is overshadowed during adolescence by that of other social domains—schools, neighborhoods, peers, and work. This study describes the family processes and environments of (n = 98) chronically violent delinquents. Interviews with youths and their mothers assessed family social process and environments and the social domains and institutions with which they interact. Analyses of youth reports of family environments and processes yield three family types: “interactionist” families exhibiting a high degree of internal interaction and bonding; “hierarchical” families characterized by parental dominance and the presence of family bond and interaction patterns; and “antisocial” families marked by criminality and family violence. Family variables have weaker explanatory power than do other social influences on violent delinquency. The relative contributions of family supervision practices and school environment varied by crime type. Social influences outside the family appear as stronger contributors to delinquency and violence during adolescence, regardless of early childhood experiences. The results underscore the importance of integrating social policies regarding family, crime, and neighborhood.",

      "abstract": "Equal opportunity theory is based on the idea that inequality of individual achievements is a complex phenomenon. It is formed by two groups of factors: (1) one's own decisions and efforts (inequality of efforts) and (2) circumstances beyond one's control (inequality of opportunities). Therefore, wealth inequality caused by effort factors (1) is fair and is not to be compensated for, whereas differences in welfare caused by objective circumstances (2) are unfair and should be compensable (the compensation principle). This paper introduces an assessment of circumstances associated with family background: composition, psychological atmosphere, well-being, occupation, education, etc. Parents' education and two-parent status appeared to be the most important circumstances. Respondents who grew up in a two-parent family with both biological parents had a higher income than those who grew up in one-parent families or with one biological and one stepparent. The low economic status of the parental family also proved to affect the well-being of grown-up children. Thus, efforts to provide equal opportunities can have a long-term effect on social inequality and build a more just society.",

These are often children who have endured years of unhappy family life, and numerous failed foster placements, and who are thus considered ‘difficult to place’. Despite this, the residential intervention has still not fully established its validity and value in the eyes of many social workers who are reluctant to seek admissions to care even when the home circumstances warrant it (Kendrick 2003: p.138). Notwithstanding this view, such is the level of need, reflected in the number of emergency admissions, there will be very few empty beds on any given night, anywhere in the United Kingdom.

      "abstract": "Resumen Se analizan las dinamicas de socializacion y de relacion a la escuela de las familias mas alejadas de la norma escolar. La socializacion esta marcada por el respeto, por el castigo como forma de poner limites y por una alternancia entre logica de desafio y pena. Este modo de socializacion deja un amplio margen de maniobra a los hijos. En el ambito escolar se conjugan bajas expectativas con bajos recursos culturales y la concepcion de que la capacidad y el gusto por el estudio no son moldeables. La relacion con los docentes puede ser de confianza en primaria, pero a medida que los ninos fracasan y su comportamiento escolar empeora, se deteriora por el choque entre las logicas que ponen en juego las madres y los docentes. Ello produce un distanciamiento entre familias y docentes que amplia el margen de maniobra de los hijos para escapar al control parental. Palabras clave: relacion familia-escuela, practicas educativas, familias de clase obrera. Abstract SOCIALIZATION PRACTICES AND SCHOOL RELATIONS AMONG FAMILIES ESTRANGED FROM SCHOOL NORMS This paper analyzes socialization dynamics and family-school relationships among families who are very estranged from the school norms. Socialization in these families is characterized by respect, by punishment as a way of setting limits and by the alternation of challenging logic and grief. This type of socialization gives children plenty of room for maneuvering. With respect to school, low expectancies are coupled with limited cultural resources and a belief that neither a taste for study nor talent is malleable. Relationships to teachers can be trustful in primary education, but as children start to fail and their behavior worsens this connection deteriorates due to the clash between the different ways mothers and teachers handle and understand these situations. This conflict widens the family-school gap, which in turn expands the children’s capability to escape parental control. Keywords: family-school relationships, educational practices, working-class families.",

      "abstract": "24 five and seven-year old children from two social milieus (working and middle class) were told stories at home by their respective mothers and an unrelated adult. In the first session of the experiment, the mother successively told three stories to her child : Free, Elicited (by a series of drawings), and Reformulated. In the second session, an experimenter told two standard stories : Verbal and Verbal + Drawings. Mothers' stories and children 's recalls were analyzed in their lexical-syntactical and semantical aspects. Stories produced by working-class mothers contained fewer words, utterances, characters, episodes and semantical propositions than stories produced by middle- class mothers. No other formal or semantical difference between the two groups of mothers proved significant. There was no evidence of a differential adaptation of the mothers to the age of the children or to the nature of the adjunct material in the two social classes. Three factors : Social milieu, Age, and Story significantly influenced children's recall. The significant interactions Social milieu * Story and Age * Story showed that the difference between the children were greater for the Verbal + Drawings story than for the Verbal one. Finally, contrary to our expectation, the differences between the working and middle-class children did not vary as a function of age.",

      "title": "Perspectives on caring for the child and the caregiver",
      "abstract": "Caregiving is a normative aspect of parenting; however, providing care for a child with a chronic medical condition or lifelong disability comes with unique expectations, needs, and challenges.1 The medical condition or disability necessitates more hands-on care, coordination of educational services and long-term needs, as well as greater physical, emotional, and financial participation than caring for a typically developing child. These demands affect both the individual life paths of family members and the entire family system. Families are faced with stresses associated with medical uncertainty, shifts in family roles and responsibilities, changes in daily routines, and social isolation. Financial burden extends from the cost of treatment regimens to changes in employment status of the caregivers as a function of care.2 The toll is compounded in families who are socio-economically disadvantaged and have limited resources. But caregiving is also a multidimensional experience associated with benefits, such as personal growth and positive meaning-making.3 As pediatric healthcare providers, an integral and critical component of our comprehensive management of young people must encompass the primary caregivers and the family. Research shows the connection between caregiver well-being (physical and mental) and child functioning.4 Consequently, failure to detect and address caregiver and family distress may lead to further decline in the caregiver, child, and family placing additional burden on the local community and larger healthcare system. As professionals, we are in a unique position with families when caring for their child; we are bestowed with long-term trust, affording us opportunities to identify caregiver and family distress, provide support and guidance, and monitor change over time. The impact of children's healthcare needs on the caregiver has been demonstrated; however, the salient features of this relationship are less clear. Moreover, less is known about the impact on other family members, such as siblings. Our field is actively working towards identifying mediators and modifiable factors linking caregiving and family functioning and child/caregiver outcomes. A critical next step is developing multilevel interventions targeting these variables: interventions that are feasible to implement, adaptable to a variety of situational factors, and easy to integrate into the already busy daily lives of families. More research is needed on the mode of delivery of evidence-based interventions (e.g. face-to-face, Web-based) and the condition-specific and cultural needs of the child and family.5 There is a myriad of challenges facing caregivers and families. What happens when pediatric patients become adults, when their own caregivers need caregiving? With advances in medicine and technology, survival rates are increasing. Technology also requires ongoing access health services and increased need to provide round-the-clock specialized services in the home setting.5 Finding high quality comprehensive care addressing caregiver needs is challenging when the care recipient is a young person; but it is even more arduous as the pediatric patient becomes an adult – both for the caregiver and the individual with the disability. As pediatric providers, we need to maintain an open discussion regarding these issues with families and provide guidance to caregivers about current needs as well as potential future needs and expectations. The approach is not one-size-fits-all; each recommendation is tailored to the individual, family, and environment. We need to advocate for policies supporting pediatric patients and their caregivers into adulthood. Such policies serve to reinforce and facilitate the implementation, integration, and preservation of our evidence-based interventions. I encourage all of us to treat pediatric patients within the context of the family system and community; to maintain dialog and continue to assess the well-being of the child, caregiver, and other family members; and to educate our trainees and early career professionals on issues of caregiving throughout the lifespan.",

Twenty parent-child dyads (parent age ≥ 90; child age ≥ 65) living in Greater Boston participated in separate one-on-one interviews. Interviews included both standardized relationship and support assessments as well as an open-ended section, generating qualitative data about the relationship. Findings from standardized support assessments indicated that both dyad members not only reported substantial upstream support (child to parent), but also notable amounts of downstream support (parent to child), especially in the domains of emotional support, listening, advice, and socializing. Practical downstream support was present too, albeit to a lesser extent. Qualitative narratives mirrored these patterns of support exchange, demonstrating that very old parents often are not only support recipients but also act as active support providers. Further, “old relationship wounds” played a role in motivating, facilitating, or hindering support exchanges.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Following placement of a relative in a nursing home, many family members maintain an active caregiving role. Families are often an invisible force in long-term care settings. Although they do not live or work inside the facility, their influence on resident and staff functioning is profound. Psychologists working in long-term care settings are frequently asked to intervene around issues involving family members. Understanding the interactive nature of problems both within and between the resident, the family, the staff, and the larger community facilitates the development of successful psychological interventions. This article presents the psychologist's use of a systemic approach in guiding interventions with families of long-term care residents. Common concerns are reviewed, including family members' adjustment to long-term care placement and the challenges between families and staff. Case examples are used to illustrate these concerns and challenges. The use of a systemic model in family work in long-term care settings is described, and then illustrated with a case example. This case is presented to highlight the interactive nature of problems that can arise between staff and families, the impact of these problems on resident care, as well as the utility of systemic conceptualization in guiding family interventions in long-term care settings.",

Its success appears to depend not only upon the capacity of the mother to lactate, i.e. to produce milk, or on the child's ability to suckle, but perhaps more significantly, on the mother's desire to breast-feed, on the availability of sufficient reference models upon which she can base her own performance and draw upon for psycho-social support during lactation. In modern settings breast-feeding is likely to involve the mother in complex and new role situations, and to become increasingly vulnerable to the social characteristics of the environment in which she operates.",

No se registraron diferencias entre quienes habían perdido perros y gatos. La mayor edad del tutor y del animal se asoció con menor sintomatología, mientras que las muertes inesperadas, y más aún las accidentales, se ligaron a más síntomas. La mayor percepción de continuidad humano-animal se ligó a más síntomas de duelo. Los recursos de afrontamiento más útiles y disponibles fueron el apoyo de familiares y amigos, la realización de rituales funerarios y el empleo de elementos (e.g., retratos) para recordar. Se destaca la información pronóstica para incrementar la predictibilidad en casos de afecciones crónicas, así como las necesidades de apoyo emocional y de orientación espiritual para legitimar la pérdida.",

      "abstract": "Background: Extra care housing for older adults offers enrichment activities alongside social and healthcare support. We explored experiences of moving in.\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the first 18 months of living in extra care housing. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used. Themes generated were examined against an existential-phenomenological theory of well-being.\nFindings: Learning to live in an extra care community showed negotiating new relationships was not straightforward; maintaining friendships outside the community became more difficult as capacity declined. In springboard for opportunity/confinement, living in extra care provided new opportunities for social engagement and a restored sense of self. Over time horizons began to shrink as incapacities grew. Seeking care illustrated reticence to seek care, due to embarrassment and a sense of duty to one’s partner. Becoming aged presented an ontological challenge. Nevertheless, some showed a readiness for death, a sense of homecoming.\nDiscussion: An authentic later life was possible but residents required emotional and social support to live through the transition and challenges of becoming aged. Enhancement activities boosted residents’ quality of life but the range of activities could be extended to cater better for quieter, smaller scale events within the community; volunteer activity facilitators could be used here. Peer mentoring may help build new relationships and opportunities for interactive stimulation. Acknowledging the importance of feeling – empathic imagination – in caregiving may help staff and residents relate better to each other, thus helping individuals to become ontologically secure and live well to the end.",

Home Economics counsellors can support the elderly by managing their daily lives in a holistic approach. To this end, at least four types of action are possible: (i) developing an individual database on the socio-economic situation of the elderly; (ii) improving the health of the elderly by organizing nutritional literacy campaigns (iii) improving the income of the elderly through training and advisory support in starting and managing an income-generating activity; (iv) initiating/participating in an advocacy campaign for the social protection of the elderly.

      "abstract": "No dialogue about ethical interventions in the treatment of childhood obesity would be complete without including the role of family, particularly parents, in influencing their child’s diet and physical activity. However, health experts have been hesitant to address this issue. Ethical concerns for family-based interventions include parents’ rights and responsibilities to protect their children, perceptions of obesity as child abuse or neglect, and the parents’ role as decision makers on their child’s behalf because of the child’s limited capacity to comprehend the risks and benefits of treatment. Family-based interventions are programs that target parents and children in creating a healthy lifestyle, which is difficult as families are confronted with an obesogenic food environment and have sedentary behaviors. Interventions that focus on improving overall family health are an ethical and effective way to decrease childhood obesity.\r\n\r\nAt a young age, children learn to assimilate their parents’ health-related beliefs and behaviors; therefore, environment and genetics can contribute to childhood obesity. In a family with 1 overweight parent, the child has a 40% chance of becoming overweight (1). If both parents are overweight, the risk increases to 80%, compared with 7% in a family in which neither parent is overweight (1). The overweight parent is considerably more likely to diet and make disparaging remarks about himself or herself in the presence of the obese child (2). These behaviors model an unhealthy self-concept for the child, which can result in an inferior body image and low self-esteem. Therefore, incorporating the family in ethical interventions for childhood obesity is imperative.",

On the other hand don't underestimate other factors of life such as personality, society and quality of life that are also very important. Family could take a serious role in the solution of addiction problem. Shortly, I will describe the basic steps of the way of a family that has one or more drug - addicted members.\r\n\r\n• It takes a long time until family recognize the problem. Usually, family gives to the problematic behavior a lot of excuses.\r\n\r\n• When they realize the problem fear, panic, perplexity, anger and sense of guilt comes to their lives\r\n\r\n• Then a member of family (usually the mother) try to find the solution alone with many ways (doctors, lawyers, priests or Psychologists e.t.c) or try to press the drug - addicted person by saying using drugs otherwise I will die or I will stop working to stay with you. This of family reaction can be continued for a long time\r\n\r\n• All the practices of the family concern its' drug - addicted member (s)\r\n\r\n• Finally the last step, and of course the hard one, is when family focuses to the real meaning: they cannot help the addicted people rebuild their lives. But can avoid behaviors that encourage the drug - addicted to stay in the problem. Family can also take care of the needs of its other members\r\n\r\n• Family recognizes that addiction is a human behavior and can happen to almost everyone, to every kind of family.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Prior relational maintenance research primarily (a) considers only one family member’s perspective, (b) explores introspective communication, and (c) examines romantic relationships among highly resourced white samples in the United States. This study considered low-income, Latina/o/x/e immigrant families’ maintenance before, during, and after migration-related separation, using standpoint theory, social communication theory, and the long-distance relational maintenance model. We conducted semi-structured interviews with Latina/o/x/e parents and children who lived in separate countries (N = 20 dyads). Findings cast light on temporal (e.g., fathers often provided little to no notice to children of the upcoming separation, complicating the families’ ability to prospectively co-construct relational continuity) and cultural factors (e.g., endorsing traditional gender norms, relying on mothers to explain the separation to children after it had begun) in families’ maintenance processes. This study offers new insight into how families communicatively construct “ongoingness” in their bonds despite emotional, technological, and legal challenges posed by migration-related separation.",

      "abstract": "Resumen. Las mujeres víctimas de violencia de género y sus hijas e hijos sufren una doble victimización, al haber vivido en un ambiente de violencia permanente dirigida en principio hacia sus madres, pudiendo llegar a ser triple cuando son testigos de este tipo de agresividad, que llega incluso a causarles la muerte. Tras el cese de la convivencia de la pareja no dejan de sufrir, en muchos casos, empiezan un régimen de visitas con el padre biológico, situación que los expone a un nuevo tipo de riesgo hacia ellos o a la madre a través de ellas y ellos. Este tipo de violencia es la llamada violencia vicaria. Tras las reformas normativas de 2015, se siguen otorgando regímenes de visitas, estancias y comunicaciones a progenitores que infringen malos tratos a la madre y no han aumentado prácticamente las medidas de protección a los menores en estos supuestos tras casi cuatro años trascurridos desde la entrada en vigor de dichas reformas. Es cierto que la solución está en la preparación especializada, pero, mientras la deseada formación de los operadores jurídicos deja huella, hay que aplicar medidas de protección a los menores y dar un paso más tomando conciencia del daño que se está cometiendo, asumir la responsabilidad que le corresponde al Estado y articular medidas indemnizatorias al igual que en su día se hizo con las víctimas del terrorismo. Sorprendentemente, ni Ley Orgánica 1/2004, ni las legislaciones autonómicas han incluido definiciones de la violencia institucional, que conlleva la obligación de reparación del daño por parte del Estado y su traducción en indemnizaciones para las víctimas.Palabras clave: violencia, género, institucional, responsabilidad, menores.",

      "title": "TELEVISION-ONLINE VIEWING ADDICTION",
      "abstract": "Television addiction is not to be an addict of a particular television content. Television addiction is to connect to television as a tool without caring what the content is. Allegedly, something with television forces us to watch it and watch it for longer than we thought when we started. The main reasons that pose a risk in the development of television addiction: lack or abuse of caregivers as a result of the work of both parents (making the baby or child sit in front of the television most of the time, making them eat in front of the television, sleeping..If the child has a very moving or attention problem, then the caregiver turns on the television to reduce the child's movement, the caregiver turns on the TV to reduce the child's squeeze because of lack of peers around, and the child's development and learning will benefit from the idea of opening the TV by the caregiver, The fact that parents or caregivers are addicted to TV ranks as conflicts between parents, financial inadequacies, and little social and environmental support. It should also be noted that television is a tool that can help family, school and society when used consciously. Watching TV also has some social benefits. These include sharing, learning some positive attitudes, etc. countable. Watching television has important tasks in social terms such as making people aware of what is going on in the world, expanding the distribution of information, teaching new words and concepts, developing their language, evaluating their free time, making them have a good time, developing their imagination, and fully revealing their creativity by directing them. When television is used in accordance with the child's developmental characteristics, there are also benefits such as accelerating the child's language development, improving the ability to extract meaning from visuals, and gaining behaviors adopted by society through the right models. It bears similarities with the European and American public regarding the dependence of Turkish people on television. As a result of studies on television addiction, weight problems and eating habits, weakening of school performance and learning difficulties, behavior and development problems, Killing Time, Social Activity, family and Model taking, sleep disorder and emotional stress, violence problem, attention problem have emerged. In particular, dialectical behavioural therapy (DDT); different treatment methods such as motivational interviewing are considered to be effective in the treatment of addiction. Some suggestions have been made to get rid of television addiction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Children who are resilient exhibit emotional and social well‐being during and after significant stresses and adversity, even though these experiences have the potential to disrupt their functioning and healthy development (Masten, 2001). Resilience does not imply that children are unaffected by adversity, but rather that they have coped effectively with their experiences and are functioning in ways that are appropriate in the context of their family, community, and culture. Resilience is a dynamic process that changes over time depending on the balance of risk and protective factors in a child's environment. Resilience arises from a mixture of personal and environmental factors. When risk factors outweigh protective factors, children are more likely to have negative developmental outcomes. But supports in the child's environment can offset risks, and when protective factors outweigh risk factors, children are more likely to experience well‐being and resilience.",

      "title": "Family carers, ethics and dementia: an empirical study",
      "abstract": "The onset and progression of dementia can turn the moral world of carers upside down. In the face of such upheaval carers attempt to create an inhabitable moral world through the application of a range of (sometimes revised) ethical principles within a framework of meaning drawn from relationships, shared histories, and other socio-cultural reference points. These principles and reference points may be different to those of health care professionals but are not necessarily or generally as adverse or hostile to them as the quote from Participant 52 above would suggest, as the deployment of similar, if not identical, principles indicate:But when I was looking after my wife I didn't need any help, she, was the one, so everything really was gravitated toward providing or doing whatever was in her best interests, you know (Participant 33).… but its only in recent months that I've realised that it is possible to, to maintain something of the independence that, uh, she had before, uh, by giving her choices in, in often very small matters, but sometimes in quite, quite large matters, and always, always consulting her about things (Participant 7).In drawing on principles and bases to justify their actions carers attempt to present themselves as having tried to act with probity – in Baruch's terms as ‘morally adequate’ (Baruch 1981) – in the face of both adversity and the inadequacies of previously held moral beliefs. (For example, taking action that might constrain or be against the wishes of the person living with dementia the action may be justified in terms of safety or best interests.) It is possible, however, to find resonances of many different ethical theories both within and across transcripts: principalism, the ethics of care, narrative ethics, consequentialism, deontology, personalism – though this is not the language of family carers. This moral positioning is important in understanding the realization of values by everyday actors, not as the application of a neatly worked out theoretical stance but as a unique and flexible configuration of values, principles, theory, and experimentation. Essentially everyday ethics is a performative practice, a realization (making real) of values and ethical principles in social context.In identifying ethical issues and the values and reasoning behind ethical decisions the project has enhanced our understanding of the moral lives of family carers of people with dementia and has provided rich data for further ethical analysis. In so doing, it has illustrated the potential of the cyclical model of empirical ethics and, hopefully, contributed in some small way to the field.",

Grown children ( N = 592 , M age = 23.82 years, 53% female, 35% members of racial/ethnic minority groups) and their parents ( N = 399, M age = 50.67 years, 52% female; 34% members of racial/ethnic minority groups) reported on the support they exchanged with one another. Intense support involved parents' providing several types of support (e.g., financial, advice, emotional) many times a week. Parents and grown children who engaged in such frequent support viewed it as nonnormative (i.e., too much support), but grown children who received intense support reported better psychological adjustment and life satisfaction than grown children who did not receive intense support. Parents who perceived their grown children as needing too much support reported poorer life satisfaction. The discussion focuses on generational differences in the implications of intense parental involvement during young adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The social networks of older people are a significant influence on their health and wellbeing. Adult children are an important element in their parent's network and provide the majority of informal care. The morphology of personal networks alters with age, employment, gender and relationships. Not having children automatically reduces both vertical familial structure and affects the wider formal and informal social links that children can bring. Childless men are missing from gerontological, reproduction, sociological and psychological research. These fields have all mainly focused on family and women. This paper reports on an auto/biographical qualitative study framed by biographical, feminist, gerontological and lifecourse approaches. Data were gathered from semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntarily childless men aged between 49 and 82 years old. A latent thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between childlessness and individual agency, relationships and socio-cultural structures. The impact of major lifecourse events and non-events had significant implications for how childless people perform and view their social and self-identity. I argue that involuntary childlessness affects the social, emotional and relational aspects of men's lived experience across the lifecourse.",

La presente investigación descriptiva-interpretativa analiza los modelos de educación familiar y formas de ocio en adolescentes en tratamiento de drogodependencias.

Los resultados muestran la diversión con amistades como el principal motivo de consumo (94,7%), donde apenas se comparte tiempo libre familiar, hay una falta de competencias sociocomunicativas y alta conflictividad. Destacan modelos educativos autoritarios (42,1% adolescentes, 38,9% familias) y negligentes (21,1% adolescentes, 16,7% familias).

Typically, children stay in foster care for a brief period of time, during which the family completes a case plan of services targeted at rehabilitation and prevention of future child maltreatment. One factor that may facilitate a successful reunification of children with their parents—or failing that, provide an alternate route to permanency—is youth's connections with extended family. However, because foster care frequently disrupts youth's social connections, practitioners may need to take extra steps to help youth to maintain connections with their extended family.",

Changes in the demographic composition of the elderly population, including projected increases in the number of very old people and in the ratio of men to women, are discussed in the first section. The second section based on longitudinal data, concerns sociodemographic differentials in age‐related household changes, and shows that, for example, both housing tenure and density of the local elderly population seem to be associated with differentials in the probability of moving into an institution. In the third section possible influences on the supply of informal support are considered. At the moment there is no evidence that working women or the divorced are less likely than others to live with an elderly parent (including an elderly parent they care for), but further work in this area is needed.",

This article aims to better understand the family and personal situations of children in the care of child services who were exposed to violence or parental conflict. It is based on a study of the life causes of a group of 809 children born in the mid-1980s who were placed at least once in the care of social services after the age of 10. One in five of these children were identified by childhood social services as having been exposed to violence or parental conflict when they were transferred to the care of child services or shortly thereafter. Compared to other children in the care of child services, children exposed to violence or marital conflict are younger when social services first intervene. In addition, they come from very large families with a great number of parental problems (alcoholism, psychological problems, difficult childhoods, prison). Many of these children have been mistreated, and, though attempts to return them to their environment are made in the first few years, these efforts are soon abandoned, and a long and chaotic trajectory ensues.",

Empty nest syndrome can lead to feelings of depression and spur marital conflicts. It may also make individuals more prone to alcoholism and identity crisis. Other symptoms include profound despair, loss of self esteem, inactivity, difficulty in thinking and concentration, sleeplessness, loss of appetite and sexual desire, inability to deal with daily affairs, and the inability to relate to anything in a positive manner. Coping with it requires self-initiative that includes being positive about children leaving home, joining hobby groups or professional associations, discussing feelings and problems with loved ones, doing things you have always wanted to do and staying happy. Cognitive behavioral therapy and counseling helps relieve related depression. While the time when children leave home can be a hard time for parents, another school of thought believes that it is a period of relaxation, enjoyment, new freedom, a time for improving the relationships with each other and learning new activities of interest. Not much research has been done on empty nest syndrome. However, it generates a lot of interest. The present paper discusses empty nest syndrome in detail.",

      "title": "Prisoner-family ties during imprisonment: Reassessing resettlement outcomes",
      "abstract": "Prison life can be hard time for both those serving\r\ntime and for their families on the outside. Prisoners\r\nwho maintain ties with family members during\r\ntheir sentence can often see their relationships\r\ntested by the physical isolation and social strains\r\nwhich imprisonment brings and the value of a\r\nfamily support network for prisoners has been\r\nrecognised across a number of prison service\r\npolicies.1 Successive studies have shown that\r\nfamilial ties are important for prisoners as a mode\r\nof social support during their sentence, as a\r\nmotivation to behave inside prison in order to\r\nimprove their chances of early-release, as well as\r\nfor resettlement outcomes including finding\r\naccommodation, desisting from drug use, and\r\nreducing reoffending risk.2 Despite these important\r\npositive outcomes, few studies have sought to\r\nunderstand what actually happens to prisonerfamily\r\nrelationships across the course of a sentence.\r\nDuring any prison sentence a lot can happen to an\r\noffender, whether it be anxiety adapting to a\r\nsentence, victimisation, loss of privileges, or a host\r\nof other events which may impact on the overall\r\nexperience of confinement. These experiences no\r\ndoubt are dynamic and open to change, not least\r\nbecause some prisoners are able to adapt to their\r\nsentence more effectively than others.3 They also\r\nhave obvious implications for ties with family. For\r\nthe families of offenders too, life paths may\r\nchange—family members may die, new romantic\r\nrelations may be developed, and children may be\r\nborn. Taking stock of these factors, policy makers\r\nrequire a clearer insight into whether or not\r\nprisoner-family ties change during a prison\r\nsentence, and what the implications of these\r\nchanges are for resettlement outcomes such as\r\nreoffending, drug use after release, and chances of\r\ngaining employment.",

      "title": "Blind adolescents' birth order as a determinant of their perception of family functioning dimensions",
      "abstract": "While other theoreticians of personality stressed only the influence of parents in early childhood, Adler paid particular attention to a psychological position of a child among brothers/sisters. There is some empirical evidence that birth order may influence vocational choice, characteristic style of interacting with others, affiliation, anxiety, perception of parents' authority, and even intellectual capabilities. Visual impairment of a family member affects a family system and a sibling subsystem in a specific way. The goal of the research was to determine whether birth order influences perception of dimensions of family functioning in families with a blind adolescent and in families with an adolescent of typical development. The sample included 32 blind (experimental group) and 32 subjects of typical development (control group) aged 14 to 26, who lived in complete families with two or three children and without serious personal, marrital or family problems. The groups were paired by sex, age, professional status and birth order of adolescents, number of children in the family, type of family (nuclear; extended) and environment (rural; urban). A Questionnaire of socio-demographic information and a Questionnaire of situation and family relationships RADIR by Knežević were applied for data collection. First-borns made lower appraisals of each dimension of family functioning than second-born respondents. There were no statistically significant differences in the control group. Differences in the experimental group were statistically significant in the following dimensions: Activity, Democracy and Structuring time and activity. Thus, the results show that first-born child's 'dethronement' has more effect if it is associated with blindness. This can be explained by fact that it is more difficult for a blind first-born child to catch up with a second-born 'rival'.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines the role of family relationships in prisoner reintegration. Romantic partners, children, siblings, parents, and other family members are important sources of material support, informal social control, and emotional support. They provide food, clothing, housing, and transportation. They monitor behavior, provide routines that encourage prosocial behavior, and motivate efforts to stay sober and find employment. They provide emotional support when stressful events arise and emotional support that can help participants weather daily frustrations. However, these same relationships often also ease the path back toward substance abuse or crime. They create role strain and motivation for crime when formerly incarcerated people struggle to fulfill family role obligations, particularly the obligation to play the provider role. They provide opportunities to use drugs or re-engage in criminal behavior. They serve as sources of conflict and emotional stress that can lead to a return to the poor coping strategies of the past, particularly substance abuse. Relationships with family members are critical social contexts that affect the process of reintegration after release from prison.",

      "title": "Introduction: Care across Distance",
      "abstract": "Many people across The world are aging in places other than those in which they were born, for reasons that are multiple and range from forced migration to lifestyle relocation.In addition, some elderly people age in their countries of origin while their close kin, including children and grandchildren, migrate (by choice or by force) to other geographical locations.When faced with the challenges of aging in the context of migration, elderly people sometimes move back to the country from which they initially migrated, because they long to return to their old home or because they hope to access care offered by their families and/or the state (Ackers 2004).Others, however, decide to migrate in an effort to be close to and receive care from family and friends who have migrated (Deneva 2012;Díaz Gorfinkiel and Escrivá 2012).And there are those who move to faraway places where life and healthcare services are more affordable and where they hope to sustain the standard of living they had prior to retirement, although in a different sociocultural setting (Benson and O'Reilly 2009).These diverse but interrelated experiences of aging and migration generate novel convergences, expectations, and practices of eldercareprocesses that are at the heart of this edited volume.By asking questions such as \"What does it mean to care at a distance?\"and \"What does it mean to age abroad?\" the contributors to this volume investigate how migration, and the related spatialization and transnationalization of care, produce unprecedented convergences of people (such as relationships between \"care receivers\" and \"care providers\"), objects (such as institutions and regimes of care; discourses of morality, responsibility, and spirituality; kinship relations; and material sustenance), and spaces (home and exile; homeland and diaspora; and vacated, transitory, and hybrid spaces of care) that challenge our assumptions about who ought to care, and how and where care ought to happen. Ć Thinking Care and Aging across DistanceResearch on care, aging, and migration has received increased attention in the social sciences since the 1990s.The vast majority of literature originated from migration studies and social gerontology, two areas of study that for a long time had minimal overlap.Only in the early 2000s has a substantial dialogue between migration scholars and social gerontologists started to emerge (see Torres and Karl 2014).One significant research strand therein focuses on the challenging consequences of migration for older migrants, including feelings of isolation and abandonment (Amin and Ingman 2014; Gardner 2009), the high emotional toll, and continual longing for home (Baldassar 2008(Baldassar , 2014;; Gardner 2004; Xie et al. 2010).Scholars have shown that this longing for home cannot be simply resolved by migrants returning to their original home after retirement.Rather, returning home at an advanced age, after several years or decades spent abroad, is far more complex than is usually anticipated, especially when social ties with friends and neighbors have weakened over the years (Ciobanu and Ramos 2016).Complementing this focus on experiences of aging abroad and returning to the country of birth in order to age at home, another central research strand explores the experiences of the elderly who stay in place while their children migrate.This literature emphasizes the void that emerges when younger people migrate, and the lack of traditional kin-based care-related services that occur. 1 These studies also investigate the rise of novel social networks that are becoming available to the elderly who stay at home (Baldock 2000;Holmén and Furukawa 2002;Lamb 2009).They also address the children's experience of guilt for not providing care in proximity to their parents; this constant worrying about parents at home is a significant part of a contemporary migrant's experience (Amin and Ingman 2014).In exploring new ways in which care unfolds across vast spaces of migration, scholars have also focused on the development of new \"technologies of care,\" including internet-based intimacies (via Skype, for example) (Wilding 2006).New communication technologies generate new possibilities of caring across distance (for example, via webcam, see Miller and Sinanan 2014; see also Kaiser-Grolimund, this volume)-strategies that children employ from afar to preserve and at times deepen contact with their parents as well as with those in the home community who take part in eldercare, such as neighbors, friends, and relatives.These new technologies and communication strategies enable people to provide advice, share stories, and express emotions across physical distance (Mendez-Luck et al. 2009).",

      "title": "To play or to parent? An analysis of the adult–child interaction in make- believe play",
      "abstract": "The universal nature of make-believe games provides a fertile environment for \nan analysis of childhood playgrounds. For example, the game of House – a roleplaying activity that centres on the mimicking of domestic duties – requires one \nplayer to portray a role, perhaps that of the ‘chef ’, and another to portray a complementary role, perhaps that of the ‘eater’.1 Constant engagement and communication between these players is necessary for the creation and continuation of \nthe game.\n When both players in the game of House are children, the motivations, perspectives and attitudes towards the activity are relatively consistent. Each roleplayer pretends to be someone else while in some sense executing common \ndomestic practices in an enjoyable fashion. However, the interjection of adult \nparticipation into a child’s imaginary playground might entail some complexity. \nThe nature of the game may change. While the child may take the lead role in \n‘cooking’ this meal and the parent may support the illusion by ‘eating’ it, the \nparent has an obligation that trumps the activity in some notable ways – a \nparent is always a parent, and certain cultural expectations related to the child’s \nproper growth and development warrant constant consideration in this ‘real-life’ \nrole. The obligation of the parent as parent is imminent in the activity, since \nboth parent and child recognize that the former has the ability to take control \nof the game’s content and direction – or even end the game – at any time. How \ndoes this de facto parental role during participation in children’s games affect \nthe play of either the adult or the child? What ethical tensions exist?\n What follows is an analysis of the adult-child engagement and interaction in \nthe game of House, speciﬁcally related to kitchen and culinary behaviour. We \nwill begin by situating the nature of make-believe play within the literature of \nwell-known play scholars (Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois and Bernard Suits) \nand highlight its qualities when the participants are not all children. We will \nthen address ethical considerations for adults as they juggle the play-role of \n‘eater’ and the ever-present responsibilities as ‘parent’ during the game of House. \nBy doing so, we will show that signiﬁcant ethical tensions and ambiguities confront the parent who participates in the child’s imaginary world.",

      "abstract": "CONTEXTO: El nacimiento de un hijo es un acontecimiento de vital trascendencia que genera cambios y ocasiona crisis, modificando la rutina cotidiana tanto de los padres como de la familia, dicho evento requiere de un despliegue de estrategias que ayuden a afrontar el estres generado por la situacion vivida. A esas estrategias se les conocen como afrontamiento, que no es mas que una respuesta al cambio asi como la produccion de nuevas conductas que le permitan a la familia hacer frente a las diversas problematicas vividas. El nacimiento de nino pretermino es uno de los principales generadores de crisis, estres y tensiones familiares debido a que el recien nacido por no cumplir con las semanas completas en el vientre materno, presenta inmadurez en sus organos y sistemas y por ello necesita cuidados especiales. Hay diferentes caracteristicas que presentan las familias, (edad, baja escolaridad, pobre apoyo social, disfuncion familiar, bajos ingreso etc.) las cuales determinan la forma en que cada familia afronta la situacion de prematurez de su nuevo miembro. OBJETIVO: Determinar la asociacion entre las condiciones biologicas, familiares, sociales y el afrontamiento familiar de padres ante el nacimiento de un nino pretermino. METODOLOGIA: estudio transversal realizado durante el 2009; la poblacion estuvo constituida por 1 980 padres de los recien nacidos preterminos de las Unidades de cuidados intensivos de la ciudad de Cartagena, y la muestra la integraron 277 padres. Confianza del 95%, un error del 5% y una prevalencia de afrontamiento del 50%. Los padres fueron seleccionados por muestreo por conglomerados. Los instrumentos utilizados fueron el APGAR FAMILIAR, FICHA SOCIODEMOGRAFICA, y F-COPES. Para estimar la asociacion entre las variables se utilizo el programa SPSS 16.0. RESULTADOS: el 85.9% de los padres de los ninos preterminos tienen un afrontamiento eficaz; entre las variables que se asocian significativamente con el afrontamiento familiar ante el nacimiento de un nino pretermino se encontraron: el estado civil OR: 0.342 (0,120 - 0,976) y los ingresos economicos OR: 3,905 (1,682- 9,068). CONCLUSION: el afrontamiento familiar ante el nacimiento de un nino pretermino se asocio con condiciones sociales tales como: el estado civil y los ingresos economicos. Las condiciones biologicas y familiares no mostraron asociacion. (DUAZARY 2011 No. 2, 150 - 158)",

      "title": "From neighbour to carer: An exploratory study on the role of non-kin-carers in end-of-life care at home for older people living alone",
      "abstract": "Background: A growing number of older people are living in single households. They form a disadvantaged group within society as regards staying at home, most likely towards the end-of-life. It is mainly non-kin-carers who try to fulfil older people’s desire for a home death, but very little is known about the challenges they face during their involvement. Aim: Getting insight into the engagement of non-kin-carers in the support for older people living alone, and a better understanding of the challenges they have to manage in end-of-life care. Design: Exploratory qualitative design; perspectives of non-kin-carers were collected through personal in-depth interviews ( n = 15) retrospectively. Setting: Home care, urban and rural areas in Austria Findings: A slow and subtle transition into care is what characterizes non-kin-care relationships which show differences between friends and neighbours. Towards the end of life, the main challenges emerged around increased physical care needs, issues of decision-making and facing the process of dying. Prior experiences with the latter, which most of the involved carers had, influenced non-kin-carers’ steadiness to allow home death and so did reliable formal support, particularly from specialized palliative care teams. Conclusion: Support of older people living alone, in particular until the last stage of life, comes along with multiple efforts. Respectful and supporting relationships between professional carers and non-kin-carers are vital to keep non-kin-carers involved.",

      "title": "Licensing Adoptive Parents",
      "abstract": "It is at present in most jurisdictions very difficult to adopt a child in cases in which one is not already connected to the potential adoptee by ties of blood or marriage. Putting aside the financial burden that the process inevitably involves, governments and adoption agencies impose strenuous requirements on potential adoptive parents. They seek to ensure that they are able to provide the children they adopt with a stable home, that they have the financial means to see to the children’s needs, and that they have no health issues that might interfere with their being able to meet the physical requirements of child-rearing.To meet these requirements, potential adoptive parents not only must fit a set of descriptive parameters – candidates are often excluded from the outset on the basis of “demographic” characteristics such as age or income status – but also have to demonstrate competence and good intention through various tests, interviews and home visits. The process of determining potential adopters' suitability can be very demanding and intrusive, with adoption agencies delving in considerable detail into deeply private matters such as the potential adopter's past experience with parenting or being parented, the nature of her relationship with past and current partners, and even her sexuality. Moreover, adoption agencies may also insist on certain behavioral requirements, from acceptance of regular monitoring to attendance of parenting classes.This demanding process of becoming a parent through adoption contrasts markedly with alternative routes to parenting. Most obviously, it is comparatively very easy for people to become parents through sexual reproduction. Though many people in the world who want to become parents are afflicted with the inability to have children in this way, the vast majority simply needs to have sex in order to become parents. The ability to bear children is widely considered a sufficient condition, both empirically and morally, for becoming a parent. In fact, the “biological bias” surrounding parenting is so manifest, little thought is given to the idea that the act of reproduction (giving birth) can be separated – philosophically as well as practically – from the act of parenting (raising a child). Perhaps more surprisingly, even where parents require assistance though New Reproductive Technologies there is little or no consideration of the potential parent's parenting competence or intention. Instead, assessment of suitability for the procedure typically takes the form of strict medical criteria. So it would appear current practice views natural and medically assisted parenting as roughly similar, while socially assisted parenting such as adoption is taken to be an entirely different kettle of fish. The main dividing issue, it would appear, is that adoption is about parenting someone else's child instead of creating a new child – a point to which we return below.Now, to be sure, liberal democratic states impose limits on how parents who have had children “naturally” can raise their children. They must send them to school until a certain age, they must refrain from all forms of physical abuse, including, in certain jurisdictions, spanking. And while some commentators seem to detect a problem because the liberal state intervenes in what amounts to one of our most private spheres – the family – the equally liberal commitment to safeguarding children's interest seems to warrant such intervention. Nonetheless, the differences between the standards that are insisted upon in the two cases are considerable. They are so at least in two respects. First, the state intervenes to limit the parental rights of natural parents only retrospectively. It does not stand in the way of people becoming parents, but only imposes limits on what they can do once they become parents. In the case of adoptive parents, the restrictions are ex ante, as well as ex post: adoptive parents are not freed from the requirements that weigh upon natural parents simply in virtue of having passed whatever hurdles are put in their way as a condition of their becoming parents, but they also have to undergo the aforementioned kind of screening in order to become parents in the first place. Second, the requirements imposed upon prospective adoptive parents are more onerous than are the requirements placed upon natural parents. The latter seem to aim only to avoid the worst excesses, whereas the former are pitched at a much higher level. In other words, the liberal state only intervenes in the natural family where parenting is demonstrably bad (such has in cases of manifest abuse or neglect), while it explicitly regulates adoptive families to the more exacting standard of good parenting.The problem (for us) is not that there might be an inherent tension within liberal political thought (and practice) about crossing the public-private sphere, but rather that there appears to be an inconsistency in how we treat natural and adoptive parenting. For if the safeguarding of childrens' interests justifies intervention by the liberal state, we must also ask ourselves whether the level of protective (or preemptive) intervention currently visited upon parents by the state is sufficient given the interests at stake. We might think it a paradox of liberal family policy that much of justified intervention only appears to come into play after some significant harm has already occurred – at least in the case of natural parents. In addition, there are legitimate concerns about the inherent inequality of treatment of natural and adoptive parents as well as (let us not forget) children. Prima facie, it would appear differential protection regimes either unjustly treat adoptive parents in an intrusive manner or else unjustly fail to protect natural children. Our aim in this paper is to ascertain whether these different regimes – and the wide range of differences between them – can be affirmed philosophically. Thus, we will ask the question whether it is right for parenting to be governed as it presently is in most liberal democracies. To the extent that our answer to this question is negative, we will propose a range of arguments aimed at recalibrating the way in which the liberal democratic state ought to govern the institution of parenting.",

      "abstract": "Gli aspetti salienti connessi al ruolo ed al genere sessuale, vissuti dall’individuo, all’interno dei contesti sociali, sono prevalentemente legati alla generativita ed alla genitorialita. La prima, di carattere fondamentalmente biologico ed organico, l’altra, con peculiarita psicologiche e comportamentali. Entrambi i concetti sono, tra loro, correlati: la capacita generativa, pone una distinzione tra il genitore biologico e quello non biologico (come avviene nei casi di adozione o fecondazione assistita) ma, e anche legata al concetto di assunzione e gestione del ruolo paterno o materno, intesi come paternita o maternita. Se tra l’una e l’altra vi e disarmonia, la sintomatologia si manifesta attraverso l’incapacita procreativa. Per mezzo degli incontri effettuati con alcune delle coppie che hanno inoltrato la domanda di adozione, presso il Consultorio ASL RMB di S. Basilio, ho raccolto le informazioni esperenziali su soggetti di eta compresa tra i 28 ed i 50 anni. Secondo i dati forniti dal Tribunale dei minori di Roma, c’e stato un notevole incremento di richieste nel decennio relativo al 1995 - 2005: da 1.144 si e passati a 2.296 domande (Tribunale minori, 2006). Questi dati fanno supporre che il fenomeno dell’infertilita e in forte aumento. I dati ISTAT italiani considerano, esclusivamente, gli indici di natalita e di fecondita senza un’analisi precisa dell’incapacita al concepimento: le nascite per 100 abitanti (indice di natalita) sono passati da 29,4 degli anni 1930 - 1932, a 10,2 del periodo 1984 - 1986, cosi come la fecondita totale, cioe i nati vivi per 100 donne in eta riproduttiva, sono passati da 94,3 (1930 - 1932), al 41 (1984 - 86). Le coppie cercano quindi un’alternativa di soluzione alla problematica procreativa attraverso l’adozione nel tentativo di compensarla.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some children who are adopted via foster care have contact with their birth families (e.g., birth siblings), yet little research has addressed this. This chapter addresses the experiences of families who adopted their children through foster care, with attention to adoptive parents’ feelings and patterns regarding birth family contact. As this chapter details, many families involved in child welfare adoptions had complex feelings about openness. Some families had significant concerns that mitigated their willingness to pursue contact. Others were opposed to birth parent contact but, to varying degrees, were willing to pursue birth sibling contact. In some cases, contact was initiated but then halted temporarily or permanently because of the perceived risks and drawbacks associated with such contact. Yet amid a lack of contact, families often remained communicatively open with their children, and some did not rule out contact in the future.",

Across multiple samples, we augment and refine extant tradeoff measures to include minor tradeoffs (e.g., limiting networking, missing a family event) in addition to the more frequently researched major tradeoffs (e.g., quitting a job, choosing not to have children) and test their effects. Work compromising tradeoffs (i.e., sacrificing work for family/personal activities) were associated with negative self-conscious emotions and lower levels of job, career, and life satisfaction indirectly through professional self-discrepancy, suggesting that making work compromises for family affects how individuals see themselves as professionals. Family/personal compromising tradeoffs (i.e., sacrificing family/personal activities for work) were associated with negative self-conscious emotions and lower levels of job, career, family, and life satisfaction indirectly through family and professional self-discrepancy, suggesting individuals view their family and professional selves less favorably when they make family/personal compromises for work. Despite negative effects for the employees, our results suggest work tradeoffs are beneficial for spouse/partner work hours and satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective We used the Social Relations Model to inspect the individual‐ and dyad‐specific components of attachment among young adults and their parents, and examined the relationship between these components and parenting stress. Background Young adulthood is a transitional period in which the whole family is concerned with “launching” the young adult and exploring new ways to interact with and attach to one another. However, research on young adulthood attachment has primarily focused on young adults' attachment style rather than reciprocal attachments among family members. Method When the young adults were age 23, mothers, fathers, and young adults from 156 families reported their mutual attachment security. At ages 18 and 23, parents of the adolescent/young adult reported their parenting stress in interparental and parent–child relationship domains. Results Attachment in the families of young adults can be separated into three components: (1) actor effects (each family member's internal working model of attachment), (2) partner effects (characteristics of each family member as an attachment figure), and (3) relationship effects (dyad‐specific attachment between family members). Increase in parenting stress in a family subsystem (dyad of family members) predicted attachment insecurity within the subsystem. Additionally, compensatory effects across family subsystems were observed. Conclusion Attachment in the family during young adulthood is explained by family members' own characteristics as well as dyad‐specific interactions and is predicted by parenting stress in family subsystems.",

      "abstract": "Separation is a common occurrence among married couples. While some families live in single-parent households after the separation, some couples remarry and form new families, leaving their children behind. Thus, this study aimed to identify the lived experiences of individuals from broken families living apart from their parents and how these experiences have affected their social-emotional development. Furthermore, this study also seeks to identify their developed coping strategies. In this study, five (5) Filipino young adults were interviewed. Themes are achieved through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), where findings of the study have shown that (1) most individuals from broken families experienced a lack of guidance, doubting self-worth, and identity crisis, which hinders their personal growth and understanding of self; (2) they were emotionally-challenged due to feelings of insecurity to family status, and lack of belongingness; (3) the phenomenon has greatly affected their relationship with their parents, and that their relationship with their caregivers and friends are stronger than with their parents; (4) their experiences has affected their sense of trust which led them to become emotionally inarticulate, selective with friends and leans for solitude; and (5) unhealthy coping strategies hinders the individual from developing their social-emotional skills. Overall, the research findings should prompt policy-makers, and helping professionals to create interventions to help these individuals.",

Both physical and sexual abuses of children are considered in relation to the stability and nature of family life surrounding such experiences. Investigations of the social causes of child abuse have considered both biography and current social context. As children usually stay in the custody of their natural mother when couples separate, one context which may favour the occurrence of male abuse is where children are living with the natural mother and a stepfather, or father substitute. The chapter investigates the extent to which family structure and maternal affect and behaviour influence the likelihood of adult male child abuse. Family structure and current life stress have also been implicated as factors that increase the risk of both forms of child abuse.",

      "title": "Responding to Multiple Diversities in Early Childhood Education: How Far Have We Come?",
      "abstract": "How Far Have We Come? A Look at Early Childhood Education over Time\nSince its inception in the United States, early childhood care and education \nhas ostensibly been grounded in issues of social justice. With a focus on the \nwelfare of young children, particularly those of the poor, two foundational \nassumptions have guided the fi eld from the start: (1) home as the primary \nsetting for the care and education of young children, which is to be carried \nout by parents, siblings, relatives, and other family caregivers; and (2) positive early experiences and environments as essential in laying the foundation \nfor young children to become good citizens and participants in school and \nsociety. However, given pervasive conceptions of the poor as not just economically but also socially and culturally impoverished, these foundational \nassumptions have been undergirded by societal norms and beliefs about who \nis capable of providing “quality” care and education. Th ese social assumptions \nled to the development of early childhood care and education outside of the \nhome (Bloch, 1987). When families were perceived to have the inability or the \ninadequacy to care for their young, the responsibility for this care shift ed to \nthe middle-class, typically white, community, which was presumed to know \nbest what young children required in terms of moral and educational development. Indeed, an examination of the evolution of the fi eld in the United States \nreveals that “one of the original purposes of the nursery school was to serve \nas a forum for educating parents about the nature and nurture of young children,” rather than leaving parenting to “trial and error” (Powell, 1991, p. 93).",

We focus on three aspects of parent–child relationships: support, criticism and dependence. Widowed persons report significantly less criticism from and more dependence upon children than do married controls, although effects are conditional upon characteristics of the late marriage. Among the bereaved, marital warmth is associated with high levels of support from children post-loss, whereas marital strains are associated with less emotional support from and dependence on children. Widow(er)s who were highly dependent on their late spouse report lower levels of criticism from children. We discuss implications for bereavement and intergenerational relations in later life.",

Because human beings continue to communicate with other people in order to continue their life and continue their life process. Biologically, psychologically and sociologically changing dimensions of the person through the chronological age, the communication process which is necessary for the continuation of life is in the process. The most important problem of old age is the disappearance of communication, which is established and maintained with the environment, with the close ones, with the society. The disappearance of communication or inactivity may also be due to concrete reasons such as the death of a spouse in the vicinity of the elderly, such as the decease of the children, the diminution of interest or the interpretation by the person in such an abstract level. The level of communication that the person has with the environment in relation to himself and himself is directly proportional to his satisfaction with life. Along with age progression, the individual and social interactions of the person are also affected. In this article, it is emphasized the importance of finding out the reasons that obstruct communication and causing communication and developing an effective communication approach to them",

      "abstract": "This study investigates how the quality of family relationships and children’s residence arrangements are associated with stepparent-child relationship quality. Prior literature has studied these factors separately, with the role of family relationships often studied only among stepfamilies with co-resident children. Little is known about how the relevance of family relationships varies depending on where children reside. The opportunity structure (e.g., contact frequency) within which various family relationships influence each other can differ across residence arrangements. This study, therefore, investigates the roles of multiple family relationships across children’s various residence arrangements - including the more contemporary arrangement of shared residence. Multiple regression analyses with moderation techniques were conducted using the New Families in the Netherlands (NFN) survey, large-scale data collected in 2020 among divorced and separated parents with a minor or (young) adult focal child ( N = 1829). We found for each family dyad (between the biological parent and the focal child, between the biological parent and the stepparent, and between the stepparent and the other biological parent of the focal child) that a high relationship quality was associated with higher stepparent-child relationship quality. Their importance, however, varied across residence arrangements. Poor relationship quality of the biological parent-child dyad and the stepparent-other biological parent dyad was associated with a poor stepparent-child relationship, especially when the focal child was nonresident. Whereas, there was a positive association between the stepcouple relationship and stepparent-child relationship quality primarily for children living full-time with the stepfamily. Altogether, the relationship quality of various family dyads spills over to the stepparent-child dyad - though the extent of this spillover differs depending on the opportunity structure determined by children’s residence.",

      "abstract": "in isolation from family or community and models held of children influence approaches to their early learning and childcare.It is therefore important to address the nature of transition and the ways in which transitions in life may affect transitions in early childhood education and viceversa.A range of issues challenges definition of transition: it is suggested here that these issues have become more complex over the historical time in which transitions have been studied.It may be argued that there has been considerable consensus over the years about what may matter in early childhood educational transitions, but this is no longer without debate or challenge.The contested issues are frequently presented in a dichotomous way.Transitions may be single or multiple; continuous or discontinuous; suggest readiness or lack of it; highlight resilience or vulnerability; imply agency or lack of control; be visible or silenced; rest on a developmental or a sociocultural model; may infer that the child should be the site of change or conversely that the system should change to accommodate the child.Multiple perspectives are called for as the child in transition is variously understood in the context of family, relationships, identities, culture, services, and community.For a considerable time Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory was the most commonly invoked conceptual framework for the study of transitions in early education.Now other theoretical sources are being used: researchers draw on, for example, anthropology, educational theory, creativity, philosophy, and psychology and consequently new approaches and paradigms are developing.Transition in early childhood education has become a field of study in its own right.Findings of transition studies argue for acknowledgement of young children's experience before, during, and after any time of transition and illustrate the many ways in which current systems shape children's experiences.The understanding generated by research into early childhood educational transitions and the processes involved, must reach into policy and practices: a job done very well by many of the authors cited in this article",

The aim of this study is to examine the concordance of fathers' representations of their children during the transition to parenthood. The influences of demographic variables, psychological wellbeing, and personality on the stability of these representations are investigated. At 26 weeks gestational age and when infants were six months old, fathers (N = 243) completed questionnaires and the Working Model of the Child Interview during a home visit. A strong association was found between fathers' prenatal and postnatal representations. First-time fathers more often had balanced representations than fathers who already had children. Furthermore, agreeable fathers were more likely to evolve from a non-balanced prenatal representation to a balanced postnatal representation.",

Victims may be children who are sexually or physically abused, wives or live-in partners, or older relatives. Physicians are often the first points of contact for patients who have been abused, but the abuse is frequently concealed by the victims. Physicians should be alert to signs of battering such as bruises in various stages of healing, unusual behaviour in children and interpersonal difficulties in the family. There are a number of options in prevention and treatment, including referral to social service and legal authorities, calling on other resources in the family and helping the individual develop coping skills. This review also lists a large number of social agencies in Canada that are willing to help victims of abuse.",

      "title": "Les personnes âgées face à la dépendance culinaire : entre délégation et remplacement",
      "abstract": "Les pratiques alimentaires se modifient au fil du vieillissement. Parmi les nombreux facteurs qui peuvent rendre compte de ces modifications (transformations physiologiques, dégradation de l’état de santé, etc.) nous insistons ici sur les effets de la dépendance culinaire conduisant des personnes âgées ne pouvant plus assurer approvisionnement et/ou préparation des repas à les déléguer à un tiers. On distingue différentes configurations selon les liens entre aidé et aidant: conjoint, enfant, professionnel. L’analyse se base sur une enquête effectuée en 2001 par questionnaire auprès de personnes âgées de 60 ans et plus (N=800) et sur une cinquantaine d’entretiens effectués en 2006 auprès de personnes de 70 à 90 ans vivant à domicile. Les résultats statistiques montrent que la délégation du ravitaillement, totale ou partielle, augmente avec l’âge et s’exerce de plus en plus hors du cercle du ménage et de la parenté. Il s’ensuit une moindre maîtrise du choix des produits par les personnes concernées, et leur alimentation s’en trouve modifiée. Ce constat nous amène à approfondir, viades études de cas, l’impact de l’organisation domestique sur l’alimentation et à examiner de plus près la délégation de tout ou partie de la chaîne culinaire. L’analyse montre notamment que la dépendance culinaire conduit à une redéfinition des rôles conjugaux (variable selon le type d’incapacité et le sexe du dépendant) et à la nécessité dans certaines situations du recours à un tiers non conjugal (enfant, professionnel). Le sexe et le statut de l’aidant (mari/épouse; fils/fille; professionnel) et la relation entre l’aidant et la personne âgée dépendante jouent de manière centrale dans le maintien ou non des habitudes alimentaires, au regard notamment du rôle crucial de la décision féminine en matière de contenu des approvisionnements et des menus.",

The differences between parents' socialisation styles lie in the means they employ to get their message over (words, physical sanctions, example, or most usually a variable mixture of these), in the principles that inform their intentions, and in the nature of the messages themselves, both explicit and implicit.",

Extrapolating from consanguineous families, the elderly seek the support groups, which exercise fundamental functions not only by replacing, in many cases, the absence of family members already in place, but for filling spaces that the society, in general, has left empty for those ages.",

      "abstract": "Caring systems for parents in the adolescent behavioural addictions. Parents still play a major role in the life of their children during their adolescence. In case of behavioural addiction, they would often feel helpless, distressed and disqualified. Yet, they still have a major role to play to ensure the best possible development of their child, while respecting him growing into an adult. An excessive proximity might be considered as intrusive, whereas an excessive distance might be considered abandonment. Most of the time, behavioral addiction reflects a malaise among adolescents, possibly also affecting their families. General practitioners are at the forefront of the detection and support of patients and their families. There are various caring systems dedicated to families: parental counselling, family therapies (systemic therapy, multiple family or multidimensional family group therapy) and parents groups. They pursue the same objective: helping families regain a sense of capability.Prise en charge des parents dans les addictions comportementales de l’adolescent. À l’adolescence, les parents occupent encore une place importante dans la vie de leur enfant. Dans les situations d’addiction comportementale, ils se sentent souvent désemparés, démunis et disqualifiés, pourtant leur rôle est fondamental pour assurer le meilleur développement possible à leur enfant tout en respectant le futur adulte en devenir. Une trop grande proximité est vécue comme une intrusion alors qu’une trop grande distance est vécue comme un abandon. L’addiction comportementale révèle le plus souvent un mal-être chez l’adolescent et parfois dans sa famille. Le médecin traitant est en première ligne pour le dépistage et l’accompagnement du patient et de sa famille.

      "title": "Families of Enuretic Children Part I: Family Type and Age Part II: Family Culture, Structure and Organisation",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The distribution of enuresis was found to vary with social class and family setting. A model of enuretic survivors illustrates that general factors connected with social class seem most relevant to children of an age to enter school, family deviance to pre‐pubertal schoolchildren, and discontinuous family relationships to pubescent children. Trends in these data have been examined for congruence with hypotheses formulated from these findings, before seeking a larger body of material in which probability tests can be made. Structural and cultural factors differentiated between the families of five‐year‐old enuretic children and their controls. Enuretic families had made fewer extraneous marriages than the families of controls, they had less often established residential independence at marriage, and the mother had gone out to work in the child's early years somewhat more often. The elements common to deviant families differentiated between the families of ten‐year‐old enuretic children and their controls. The families of ten‐year‐old enuretic children were more often in poverty, and their mothers more often handicapped or burdened. Continence was somewhat delayed in children exposed at an early age to a wide range of social interaction and less exclusive relations with their mothers; was furthur delayed in children whose mothers were personally or socially handicapped in the maternal role; and was apparently most delayed in those who suffered total disruption of maternal relations. RÉSUMÉ Les families des enfants énurétiques On a trouvé que la distribution de l'énurésie variait avec la classe sociale et les conditions familliales. Un modèle de survivants énurétiques démontre que les facteurs généraux en connection avec la classe sociale semblent plus applicables aux enfants en âge d'entrer à l'école, les déviations familliales aux écoliers avant la puberté, et l'interruption de rapports familliaux aux enfants pubères. On a examiné si les tendances révélées dans ces données sont conformes aux théories formulées d'après trois résultats avant de rechercher une plus grande masse de matériel où Ton pourra pratiquer des calculs de probabilité. Des facteurs de structure et de culture différenciaient les families des enfants énurétiques de cinq ans de celles de leurs contrôles. Les families d'énurétiques avaient contracté moins de seconde mariages que les families des contrôles, elles avaient moins souvent établi des résidences indépendantes au moment du mariage, et la mère était partie travailler pendant les premières années de l'enfant un peu plus souvent. Les éléments communs aux families désunies différenciaient les families des enfants énurétiques de 10 ans de celles de leurs contrôles. Les families des enfants énurétiques de 10 ans étaient plus souvent pauvres, et leurs mères étaient plus souvent handicappées ou surmenées. La continence était en quelque sorte retardée chez les enfants exposés pendant leur jeune âge â une large série d'interéactions sociales et à des relations moins exclusives avec leur mêre; elle était encore plus retardée chez les enfants dont les mêres étaient handicapées personnellement ou socialement dans leur rôle maternel; et les délais les plus importants apparemment survenaient chez ceux qui souffraient d'une interruption totale des relations maternelles. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Familienverhältnisse enuretischer Kinder Es wurde festgestellt dass das Auftreten von Enuresis aufgrund sozialer Klasse und Familienumgebung variiert. Eine Aufstellung von Enuretikern zeigt dass allgemeine, mit der sozialen Stellung verbundene Faktoren den stärksten Einfluss auf Kinder im Vorschulalter, Familien‐Abweichungen auf Kinder im prepubertären Schulalter und unter‐brochene Familienverhältnisse auf pubertäre Kinder haben. Die aus disen Daten ersichtlichen Tendenzen sind auf Kongruenz mit aus drei Befunden formulierten Hypothesen untersucht worden, bevor man darangeht, einen grössen Korpus von Material zusammenzutragen, in dem Wahrscheinlichkeits‐Tests ausgeführt werden können. Struktur‐ und Kulturfaktoren differenzierten sich zwischen den Familien mit fünfjährigen enuretischen Kindern und ihren Vergleichsfamilien. Enuretische Familien hatten weniger ‘auswärtige’ Ehen geschlossen, hatten bei der Eheschliessung nicht so oft eigene Wohnungen bezogen, und während der frühen Jahre des Kindes war die Mutter etwas häufiger zu auswärtiger Verdienstarbeit gegangen. Die den abweichenden Familien gemeinsamen Elemente unterschieden sich zwischen den Familien zehnjähriger enuretischer Kinder und ihren Vergleicheobjekten. Die Familien zehnjähriger enuretischer Kinder litten öfter an Armut, und ihre Mütter waren öfter behindert oder überbelastet. Diese Befunden werden erörtert im Hinblick darauf, wie sie auf die Beziehungen enuretischer Kinder mit ihren Familien und im besonderen mit ihren Müttern einwirken. RESUMEN Familias de niños enureticos Se halló que la distribución de la enuresis varía según la clase social y la situación familiar. Un estudio de niños no curados muestra que factores generates asociados con la clase social son los más pertinentes para los niños que comienzan la escuela, que la desviación familiar es más pertinente en la prepubertad, y que relaciones familiares interrumpidas son muy importantes para los niños que han llegado a la pubertad. Se han examinado tendencias en estos datos para hallar si acuerdan con unas hipótetis deducidas de tres experiencias, antes de buscar una materia más grande para hacer pruebas de probabilidad. Las familias de los niños enuréticos de 5 años, y las familias de niños no enuréticos de la misma edad, se diferenciaban por su estructura y cultura. Los padres de los niños enuréticos se habían casado menos veces afuera, el matrimonio al casarse tenía menos veces una morada suya, y la madre había trabajado más veces durante los primeros años de vida del niño. Las familias de los niños enuréticos de 10 años y las de los niños de control se diferenciaban en todo lo que contribuye a la desviación familiar. Las familias de los niños enuréticos eran más veces pobres, y sus madres tenían más veces incapacidades o un exceso de trabajo. Continencia estaba algo retardada en niños expuestos muy jóvenes a relaciones sociales extensas, y a relaciones menos exclusivas con sus madres; estaba más retardada en niños cuyas madres tenían inhabilidades personales o sociales para el papel de madre, y muy retardada en niños que sufrieron un rompimiento total de relaciones con sus madres.",

      "title": "The role of social support in inclusion of families raising children with disabilities",
      "abstract": "Social support can be defined as perceived care, respect and help from others. The concept of social support should include issues of social inclusion. The community itself has an important support role for its members. Informal and formal social support systems have an important role in supporting families who have a member with a disability. In most cases the informal social support is provided by friends, family members or neighbors, while the formal support is provided by professionals or paid helpers from the local community. The birth of a child with a disability creates a situation which requires every possible family care and protection. The family also needs the support from the community, which is very important because it can provide conditions for full inclusion of the child. The aim of this presentation is to show the results of the study of the role of the perceived social support in the inclusion of children with developmental disabilities and their families. The sample is structured as a probabilistic (N=308 parents of children with disabilities aged 0-7 years). The data were gathered by a questionnaire method. Qualitative content analysis was applied. The research results show that the social support has a very important role for families of children with disabilities. For the inclusion of children with disabilities in the community is essential coordination between the social welfare system, health system, education and employment system. Results show that a family’s financial situation is also crucial to insuring their inclusion. In addition the quality of inclusion of the child and their family depends on the quality of information on their rights, housing conditions and the availability of orthopedic and other medical supplies. Further, when parents were asked what types of assistance they needed the most, the majority of the respondents said it was financial assistance, followed by practical assistance, adequate/available health care and psychological assistance/counseling. Study results illustrate some trends and problems that families of children with disabilities face in accessing or attempting to access certain social rights and their inclusion in Croatian. This paper describes the most important elements that make up guidelines to regulate access to social rights and inclusion of children with disabilities and their families.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the development of suckling behavior, spatial relations, social behavior, and play behavior in 2 mother-calf dyads of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Each dyad was observed 4 hours weekly throughout the calves’ 1st year. The dyads differed in calves’ sex and mothers’ parity. The dyad with the primiparous female needed more time to establish suckling and swimming routines. After the 3rd month, interactions with the mother (flipper-rub, rest together, social play, and calf watches mother) were significantly more frequent in the female calf, whereas interactions with the calves’ father (swim together, rest together, and social play) were significantly more frequent in the male calf. The calves showed high rates of object play and social play. They seemed to modify their type of play according to the opportunities they were offered. A mentally stimulating object was preferred to simpler toys. The knowledge of the details of mother-calf behavior helps to develop appropriate breeding conditions that are vital for the survival and well-being of captive dolphin calves.",

      "abstract": "Die Scheidungsraten in Deutschland nehmen jährlich um ca. 2% zu. Im Durchschnitt sind in drei von vier Scheidungsfällen minderjährige Kinder betroffen. In den Medien wird schon darüber diskutiert, ob es sich bei der Familie um ein „Auslaufmodell“ handele: Ist das System Familie noch zu retten? Der Anteil der behandlungsbedürftigen Kinder und Jugendlichen, die bei einem getrennt oder geschiedenen Elternteil aufwachsen, ist mit 40% deutlich höher als bei der Normalbevölkerung (30%). Damit ist noch nicht ausgedrückt, wie belastet Kinder psychisch kranker Eltern sind, die häufig elterliche Versorgungsaufgaben übernehmen müssen. Aber auch bei intakt erscheinenden Familiensystemen ist die Rate der Störungen des Sozialverhaltens, der funktionellen Beschwerden, Ess-Störungen, depressiven Störungen und des Suchtmittelkonsums bei Minderjährigen angestiegen (HBSC-Studie WHO 2003). Schulpädagogen im Regelschulsystem sind überfordert. Die Familienberatungsstellen werden vor allem von kooperativen Sorgeberechtigten aus Mittelschichtfamilien frequentiert, die besonders gefährdeten Minderjährigen gar nicht oder erst viel zu spät von den Hilfe-Einrichtungen erreicht. Dem steigenden Behandlungsbedarf entgegen werden die Mittel der öffentlichen Gesundheits- und Jugendhilfe drastisch verringert. Die kassenärztliche Versorgung von psychisch kranken Kindern und Jugendlichen ist nach Expertenmeinung nicht ausreichend, und dann noch die steigende Kinderarmut (Bundesland Nds. 27%)!",

      "abstract": "58 Acontecimiento Si los ancianos son particularmente demandantes de asistencia especifica es porque el envejecimiento es un proceso que implica perdida de autonomia o progresiva dependencia. La necesidad de esta asistencia, en nuestros dias, se acrecienta, entre otros, por los siguientes motivos: a. El peso demografico de los ancianos mayores de 80 anos. En rigor, la expresion «tercera edad» es equivoca, ya que engloba a estas personas realmente ancianas, necesitadas de asistencia mayoritaria e intensiva con los menores de 75/80 anos, cuya independencia personal puede ser completa, gozando de autonomia y competencia. b. El aumento significativo de las dolencias e incapacidades que generan dependencia, en torno y a partir de esa edad. La prolongacion de la vida en terminos absolutos no es paralela a la persistencia de la vida independiente, que no ha crecido tanto, por lo que se genera un tramo final de vida dependiente. c. El peso ponderado del numero de hogares unipersonales entre esas personas (viuda/o), con hijos casados que tienen sus propias responsabilidades familiares. En las circunstancias presentes de necesidad elevada y creciente de asistencia a la tercera edad, se plantea con toda crudeza el problema del reparto de los costes de esa asistencia. En realidad, la cuestion primitiva era el control de la evolucion de los costes crecientes de la sanidad geriatrica y los originados por la dependencia de los ancianos. Pero, dada la incapacidad de las Administraciones publicas para frenar la expansion del gasto, se suscita la cuestion del criterio de reparto de las responsabilidades y de la cobertura de los costes entre los familiares y los servicios sociales. Estos criterios de reparto estan claramente influidos por la profundizacion de la crisis del Estado del bienestar; a cada nuevo retroceso, se multiplica los llamamientos de los politicos a los familiares para que amplien «sus» responsabilidades. Pero la presion privatizadora (hacia los familiares) del gasto en asistencia social proviene tambien de una consideracion de rentabilidad electoral perteneciente a los aspectos mas sordidos de la actividad politica: el gasto por plaza de una residencia asistida es elevadisimo para la escasa rentabilidad electoral que produce. El anciano acogido, de ordinario, no puede votar. Hace anos, pregunte al Director General del IMSERSO por que no calculaban cuantas residencias podrian construirse y cuantas plazas mantenerse con los fondos que ese Instituto dedica a programas menos prioritarios, como los viajes de vacaciones o las estancias en Balnearios. Con el desparpajo y la desverguenza propios del poder, me aclaro que esos Programas captan muchos mas votos que todas las Residencias existentes juntas. Asi pues, no es que no haya fondos —en terminos absolutos— disponibles para la asistencia social. La cuestion estriba en que criterio se fija para asignar los recursos y determinar las prioridades: la proteccion a los mas La asistencia a la tercera edad",

      "abstract": "One of the reasons that the “conduct” of fatherhood has been slow to change is lack of exposure to appropriate paternal role models. This research was designed to examine how fathers of young children (one child &lt; 6 years of age) shaped fatherhood roles according to various models in their lives. Following the qualitative research principles of grounded theory and comparative analysis, three key themes emerged. First, there was a void with respect to identifiable and meaningful role models. Their own fathers were not seen as good role models. Second, these fathers tended not to model their behavior after a particular individual, but, rather, their models were fragmented as they selected particular behaviors to incorporate into their roles. A third theme to emerge was the emphasis that was placed by these men on providing a role model to their children, in the absence of role models in their own lives.",

Structural equa tion modeling indicated that mothers' anxious attachment style uniquely predicted children's insecure attachment to both mother and father. In turn, associations of child-mother attachment with specific self-concept domains differed from those of child-father attachment with self-concept across age. For example, child-mother attachment was associated uniquely with perceived global self-worth and physical appearance for both younger (9-12 years) and older (13-14 years) children. In con trast, child-father attachment was associated uniquely with child-perceived school competence, and only for older children with global self-worth.",

Begrænsninger i tilgangen til ressourcer i kommunalt og regionalt regi kan opleves som udtryk for forskelsbehandling gennem othering, dvs. at blive gjort fremmed. Metode: Undersøgelsen bestod af feltarbejde på fire medicinske afdelinger, tilbagevendende interview og observationer med patienter samt interview med pårørende og professionelle omsorgsydere, som patienterne henviste til. Resultater: Ud af de 16 patientforløb, der resulterede i 54 interview, er der udvalgt en case, der redegør for, hvordan pårørende med anden etnisk baggrund kan opleve othering i kommunalt regi. Casen beskriver oplevelsen af, at éns nærmeste bliver fremmedgjort gennem manglende sprogkendskab og ved at blive behandlet ʼforkertʼ. Det kan resultere i, at man som pårørende fatter mistillid til kommunale aktører. Konklusion: Othering kan opleves som følge af strukturelle forhold og gennem interaktioner med kommunale aktører i forbindelse med at have palliative behov. Som pårørende til en patient med anden etnisk baggrund opleves othering på baggrund af et udvidet ansvar for patienten og vurderes som stærkt belastende.",

This article examines associations between belief in the future availability of instrumental support (e.g., child care, temporary housing, and financial assistance), subsequent reception of inadequate support, and depression in a socioeconomically diverse sample of new mothers. Receipt of support is associated with increased odds of experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE), whereas belief in the availability of future support appears to be protective of mental health. Mothers who experience a negative mismatch between support perception and adequate receipt of support have increased odds of experiencing an MDE compared with mothers who either receive adequate support or who have no support needs; however, their susceptibility is no greater than that of mothers who simply have unmet instrumental needs.",

      "abstract": "For better or worse, the significance of the sibling relationship throughout the life course is widely acknowledged. This paper explores the ways in which sibling relationships, in their various forms, are affected by adoption. The case-file records of 374 children recently placed for adoption in Wales were reviewed. Questionnaires were completed by ninety-six adoptive parents, with whom a sample of these children were placed, and a sub-sample of forty adoptive parents were interviewed. Most children placed for adoption together with a sibling carried a shared history of maltreatment. Many had complex, often conflictual relationships. Nevertheless, birth siblings in the adoptive home also provided support and comfort for children. New sibling relationships, created by placing children into families with existing children, carried their own set of advantages and complications. Some children placed apart from birth siblings had plans for contact that had not yet materialised. Whilst adoptive parents were often determined to help strengthen sibling bonds created and affected by adoption, this commitment was not always championed through social work intervention. The implications for social work practice in adoption are considered and a family systems framework is proposed as a way of helping to understand sibling dynamics in adoptive families.",

      "abstract": "Child-headed households are a common family arrangement in the coastal region of Kenya and beyond. These households are mainly precipitated by situations in the lives of parents that force children to take up social roles that are usually reserved for adults. While children have rights just like adults, their well-being is compromised without parents’ involvement in their lives because of missing parental obligations. Children in child-headed households are forced to handle responsibilities that are not appropriate for their developmental age, often denying them a sense of childhood comfort and burdening them emotionally, socially and psychologically. Such children end up with numerous psychosocial challenges, including low self esteem, early marriages, exposure to child labour, prostitution, trafficking and social exclusion, among others. The situation is a vicious cycle, bound to recur since such children also become parents at an early age. This paper uses data from coastal Kenya to show the inevitability of child-headed households and the need to treat such households as part of the larger repertoire of nuclear family set ups in the society.

      "abstract": "Presented at the International Conference Child Welfare in Ucraine, organized by United States Agency for International Development and Holt International Children's Service (3-4 November 2005, Kiev, Ucraine) Comentarii: The family is for a child the most appropriate environment for growth and development, as well as the place through which he/she accedes to human life, society, culture. We often face situations where the parents cannot or do not want to take on the responsibility of caring for children. For all these children, the separation from their family generates a profound trauma, with serious repercussions on the development of their personality. The child's social, psychological and affective development is influenced by the achievement of attachment and by the construction of the affective tie between child and mother. The absence of parents and of a family environment causes an absence of normal feelings and emotions in the child, delays in the physical development, behavioural deviations. There are three major elements in the case of separation: the length of the separation, the circumstances surrounding the separation and its causes, the type of care and the opportunities for development offered to the child after separation. For some, adoption is a solution for a child lacking a normal family life, lacking the relationship with the natural family, for others it is the possibility for a family to become whole, to become stronger, to have a future. If we think of the child, then the definition of adoption is centred on the child, if we direct our attention towards the family, then the definitions will highlight the dynamics of the family adopting, the motivation for adoption. Adoption is increasingly becoming more accepted in the community as a form of caring for a child within the family. in the period before December 1989, many of the families who adopted hid from the social stigma. Infertility was seen as a fault era and the adopting family was stigmatised by the community. Often the adoption was performed in secret and even the extended family did not know about it. Adopting parents used all kinds of strategies for simulating pregnancy and the preparation for childbirth, going as far as changing jobs and even moving house.",

      "abstract": "Sibling rivalry can be found in many families and frequently creates a stressful and challenging situation for parents. The arrival of a new baby often causes older siblings to feel displaced, frustrated, angry, and even unloved. Age, gender, personality and temperament, and parental behavior are factors that appear to influence the degree to which sibling rivalry occurs. Common reactions of older siblings to the birth of a new baby include aggression toward the newborn, behavioral regression, and attention seeking behavior, as well as independence and maturity. Anticipatory guidance is recommended to help parents adequately prepare their older child for the arrival of a new sibling. Strategies for managing sibling rivalry include open parent-child communication, equal treatment of siblings, non-intervention in sibling conflicts, distraction, and separation. Parents can minimize feelings of jealousy between siblings by providing a supportive, nurturing environment that allows each child to feel secure and loved.",

      "title": "Child Disability and Familial Isolation",
      "abstract": "The concept of disability is evolving both ethically and in terms of how it is described. But, while there is progress on the theoretical side, attitudes tend to lag behind. Disability in children always generates a host of fears and contradictory representations in our society. The focus on this difference stigmatises and then plunges subjects into complex relational terms. Being the parent of a child with disabilities means sharing something of the stigma that the child endures. The interaction between the social environment and the family, the private and public generates tensions that become real psychic conflicts within the family group. From the perspective of psychological practice with disabled children and their families, we propose to explore the socio-psychological mechanisms implemented. Under the combined effect of their own childhood history and social messages relating to disability, parents will gradually develop defence mechanisms mainly marked by the avoidance of creating bonds with others.",

The father's experience of his child was shown to correlate with the child's experience of him. Fathers experiencing their child in a positive way had been more active in the care of the child, less \"authoritarian\" and more physically intimate. They described good marital relations. Fathers with a low income or unsatisfied with their job were more negative towards their child than others. There was no association between the father's mental health and his experience of his child. Fathers reporting poor early parental contact were less positive towards their child than others. The man's relation to his own father was more connected with his experience of his child than his relation to his own mother, especially when the child was a boy.",

Existe una gran heterogeneidad en los perfiles de familias que se encuentran en esta situacion y en los motivos desencadenantes de esta nueva situacion: desde familias multiproblematicas y de riesgo donde predominan las situaciones de desproteccion y desamparo de los menores, hasta cuidado del menor por motivos mas normalizados(fallecimiento de los padres, divorcios, etc.)El impacto de esta situacion familiar en los abuelos demanda una especial atencion, por la problematica asociada a la reconversion de roles, desde abuelos a padres sustitutos. La prevencion de la aparicion de consecuencias negativas (burnout, sintomatologia depresiva, perdida de relaciones sociales, problemas economicos, problemas de escolarizacion, etc.) junto con la promocion de consecuencias positivas (relacion con los nietos, etc.)sera objeto de analisis en nuestro trabajo.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe migratory process is a phenomenon that virtually all nations have experienced and continue to experience which leads to the fragmentation of family units. In instances , these migrants are parents which may adversely affect the children left behind having impact on their psychological well –being. Therefore, for some children the experience may foster healthy growth, development and strengthens kinship relations, while for others it may result in feelings of neglect, abandonment and loneliness. There are many children who receive little or no physical or emotional nurturance from surrogate caregivers and experience a sense of abandonment by their parents’ prolonged absence. Therefore, it is not surprising that negative behaviours can develop among some children experiencing parental absence as a consequence of migration, a situation that may deprive them of healthy interaction, love and attention from their parents . these children face issues of grief and loss that may also give rise to depression, emotional distress and behavioural disorders Often, migration is examined from the standpoint of its positive impact on the nation’s economy through remittances sent to improve family life of dependents left behind. To some extent, this has meant overlooking how migration can directly contribute to family separation when takes the form of parental migration.\r\nAim of study \r\nThe aim of the study was to assess the level of psychological well being of children of migrated parents as reported by caregivers\r\n Material and Methods \r\nQuantitative research approach and non-experimental research design was used .the sample of 60 caregivers of children of migrated parents from selected villages of District Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar was taken with snow ball sampling technique . The child behaviour checklist to assess the psychological well being was used to check the level of psychological well being of children to collect data .the analysis was computed by using descriptive and inferential statistics .\r\nResults :\r\nThe results revealed that majority of children i.e 93.3 % were normal ,5 % indicating a borderline followed by 1.67 % with clinical .moreover statistically there is no significant impact of socio demographic variables on the psychological well being of the children.\r\nRecommendation\r\nThere is a need of informational campaigns , educational and support programs for children and support mechanisms for migrating parents and substitute caregivers",

      "abstract": "Romantic relationship becomes a situation that can not be separated from children who get into adolescence life. Most children begin interested to other sex in their teenage lifes and decide to have romantic relationship. Somehow, the issue of romance becomes one of the elements causes a variety of problems and misunderstanding in the family. Those problems arise due to the lack of effective communication about romance, especially between a child and parents. The method used in this reserach is qualitative research with phenomenological approach. The goal of this research is to understand the family communication about children’s romantic relationship. The theories used in this research are Family Relationships Scheme theory, theory of Lie, theory of Love, Close Relationship, and Self Disclosure. The outputs of this research are : (1) Parents from plural family give the right to children to make their own decisions, while from consensual family force their children to obey to their decisions, including about romantic relationship (2) Children tend to be more open to their when they communicate about daily life (3) The disclousure of children to their about romantic relationship, depends on the emotional attachment and the response from their when they communicate (4) Communication between children and gives influence to the type of love for children (5) Siblings can be a parents to the child by reminding the rules of romantic relationship from their parents. The conclusion of this research is the lack of self disclosure in communication about children’s romance in the family. The suggestion are parent and children should be mutually open in communication about children’s romance, the rules of romance should be delivered explicitly by parents, should not excessively evaluate, criticize and judge what their children explain",

Most interactions initiated by the caretaker seemed to consist largely of caretaking activities, and a relatively large verbal component was evident only with increasing age. Specific caretakers were associated with specific types of social interactions. The mother was the primary caretaker, being responsible for most of the carrying, questioning, ordering, teaching, and prohibiting of her son or daughter. Interactions initiated by the infant generally included touching and preverbal vocalizations. Most social play and touching involved siblings. Visual interest, vocalizing, and smiling were greatest when directed to a person outside the nuclear family. The father was found to have little effect on the social environment of the infants observed.",

      "abstract": "Socialization is accomplished by a wide set of methods specific to a certain society, social stratum and age. For instance, it can include the methods of nursing a baby; the methods of encouraging and punishing in a family, age-mate groups, training or task teams; various methods and types of relations in basic life spheres (communication, games, sport) etc. The better organization of social groups is the more opportunities it provides with socializing influence on an individual. However social groups are unequal in their ability to provide influence on a personality at different stages of its ontogenetic development. Thus, family has the greatest influence at tender and preschool age. In teenage years and adolescence, the most effective influence of age-mate groups appears and grows. Status, labour collective or professional team and individual people take the central stage in adulthood. There are some factors of socialization, the value of which remains throughout an individual’s life. They are nation, mentality, ethnos. Recent years scientists attach greater importance to macro level socialization issues including natural and geographical conditions as it is determined that they have influence on formation of personality both directly and indirectly. Macro level socialization issues knowledge let comprehend the peculiarity of disclosure of general laws of development of individual as Homo sapiens. Recognition of personality activity as a dominant factor of its formation raises the question of purposeful activity, self-development of personality i.e. permanent work on self-improvement and spiritual development. The possibility to complicate tasks and creation content gradually, implementation of age and individual approach, formation of creative individuality equally to implementation of collective education and stimulation of personal self-governance through its further development are ensured by self-development. Personality as a product of life in the meantime is a living organism. The relation between social and biological things in the formation and behavior of a personality is extremely complex and has an unequal impact on it at different stages of individual development, in different situations and types of communication with other people. Courage can run into imprudent when the desire to draw attention to oneself (natural need for recognition) is stimulated. Courage prompts another people to brave life obstacles, although no one but them know about it. It is important to see the level of expression of the corresponding trait (or even to notice it). It is proved that socialization is a non-linear process of self-development of individual under the influence of social medium, the whole environment. The determine factor of socialization is not natural inclinations themselves but personal qualities formed by the external environment as a product of education and upbringing.",

Parents’ basic socio-psychological needs (SPN), including the need for inclusion, control, and love, were considered as a factor of relationships in the family.The paper presents the results of the study of married couples and their preschool schildren, which showed that socio-psychological needs of mothers and fathers determined the parameters of interaction in the “mother – child / father – child” pairs, as well as relation of the mother/father to the family, the husband/wife, and the child’s relation to the mother/father. The study showed the following: (a) the prominent need for inclusion conditioned a higher intensity of a positive relation to their own families in men and women; (b) parents’ needs for control/dependency played a special role in the formation of the child’s relation to his/her mother and father; (c) the mother’s need for other people’s love conditioned the parameters of her interaction with her child; (d) compared with mothers, fathers’ socio-psychological needs conditioned the interaction with their children to a lesser degree.The comparative analysis between the level of socio-psychological needs in mothers and fathers and the parameters of their emotional interaction with their own children showed that mothers scored higher on the scale of the need for inclusion in various social groups, as well as in the parameters of emotional interaction with the child. The obtained results enabled authors to draw the conclusions about (a) the actualization of the mother’s need for inclusion in various social groups at this stage of life, (b) emotional involvement of mothers in the communication with their children. Mothers were more inclined to understand the emotional state of their children, showed empathy, experienced a greater variety of feelings in the communication with their children, as well as related to themselves as to a parent more positively.",

Sin embargo, hay ninos que la padecen en mayor intensidad lo cual las imposibilita tener un contacto satisfactorio con los demas. \r\nLa timidez es una barrera que separa al nino de su entorno. Esto se puede apreciar en la escuela y en diversas situaciones le exigen el uso de sus capacidades sociales para relacionarse con el otro. \r\nEl hogar y la escuela constituyen los puntos de referencia del nino. En estos lugares se aprecian la participacion, colaboracion y el trabajo en equipo, pero en ocasiones el nino no puede desenvolverse de la manera esperada porque tiene dificultades para hacerlo. \r\nEntonces es cuando debido a su escasa participacion en: la toma de decisiones, actividades escolares en los juegos el timido es relegado, aislado e incluso olvidado.",

Néanmoins la théorie de l’attachement telle que décrite par Bowlby peut s’appliquer dans des sociétés relativement éloignées de celles du monde occidental à condition de prendre en compte le contexte dans lequel évoluent l’enfant, sa mère et les différentes figures d’attachement. Le contexte social, religieux et économique a forcément un impact sur les processus d’attachement de l’enfant (et à l’enfant). Il en est de même du vécu familial et des représentations des enfants, notamment de ceux dits « particuliers » (enfants porteurs de maladies génétiques ou handicap, prématurés, etc.). Dans certains cas, l’attachement peut être difficile, voire entravé, par la peur du devenir de l’enfant que chaque société aborde selon sa réalité, ses convictions et ses possibilités. Les personnels médico-sociaux qui interviennent auprès des familles migrantes sont appelés parfois à se décentrer de leurs normes pour ne pas se méprendre sur certains comportements « étranges » qui, loin de signer un déni de l’enfant et une incapacité à répondre à ses besoins, tendent à le protéger. Ici comme ailleurs, ce ne sont pas les pratiques qui témoignent de l’attachement sécure, ce sont le comportement de l’enfant et la qualité de la relation avec la figure maternelle.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment is the reciprocal affectionate relationship that binds two people deeply together, or, more simply, love. Attachment is also the process by which infants internalize emotional connections to others— that is, learn to love. Attachment influences all aspects of child development and becomes the basis by which the child relates to the world, learns, and forms relationships throughout life. The life experiences of most internationally adopted children prior to placement conspire to interfere with this process. Although no statistics are available, disordered attachment undoubtably occurs more frequently among international adoptees, who are virtually all placed after 6 months of age, than among adoptees placed as newborns. Disordered attachment profoundly affects the well-being of the child and family. Through the publicizing of several cases of international adoptees with severe attachment disorder in the popular media, awareness of attachment issues for internationally adopted children has greatly increased.",

      "title": "How to Match an Older Adult with the Right Housing",
      "abstract": "There is no one right answer. How do older adults get matched the right mix of services and housing? It is a still evolving process clearly unscientific answers. First, someone has to care enough to pay attention to what individual older people can do for themselves and what help they need. Elders need to be realistic about their own needs and capabilities, or family or community must take notice and evaluate. Elders and families can seek professional help to identify sources of assistance, they can seek out the resources themselves, or, if a helper or caregiver is needed, family members can take on the tasks by themselves or in combination others, either through formal (paid) or informal (volunteer) sendees. In some instances, it may be necessary for the family members and the older person to live closer to each other. In such cases, there are various housing options. Parents can move in an adult child. Adult children can add an accessory unit to a home so parents can live with diem but independendy, next door. Having family close can mean the difference in an older person managing less formal care. Even in a group-living situation, family visits can reduce the level of assisted care required. The Internet affords a great means to answer questions about local community services. An example is serimmsource. com. Does the Red Cross offer transportation to medical appointments? Who delivers meals? Does the closest senior center have transportation? Who provides reasonably priced noon meals? Can taxi vouchers replace a driver? Another source of service listings is the local area agency on aging, which is charged keeping a list of all local services for older people. AAAS accomplish this task varying degrees of expertise, but all are of some assistance. Finding one nearby is as easy as calling Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116. Given a choice, most older people opt to receive services within their own homes. This choice can be realistic in an urban or suburban setting or in an age-restricted community a concentration of older people. It is realistic if the older person has enough money to cover the cost of services or has so little money that agencies provide services free or at low cost. And even all these requirements met, a trusted person is still required to ensure that caregivers or senice providers are honest, show up, and do not take advantage. Matching older adults to appropriate housing need not be a complex task. Families can use a simple chart of needs and options. In addition to remaining in the current situation, housing options could include board-and-care homes, independent-living settings in the current neighborhood or elsewhere, options close to adult children (from living them to living in a nearby apartment, for example), community independent living the possibility of progressing to assisted living later, if needed, or assisted living now. Those doing the planning must keep in mind that regulations for independent and assisted living vary by state. What Florida permits in a licensed assisted-living facility is different from what California allows, for example. …",

      "title": "Anti-discriminatory Practice: Caring for Carers of Older Adults with Mental Health Dilemmas",
      "abstract": "This chapter is largely concerned with carers of older adults who have mental health and well-being concerns. Specifically, it focuses on informal and unpaid caring roles, usually carried out by family members or friends of the older adult rather than by paid carers provided through public or private services. However, much of the content of this chapter may also be relevant for paid carers.\r\n\r\nA carer has been defined as:\r\n\r\nanyone who cares, unpaid, for a friend or family member who due to illness, disability, a mental health problem or an addiction cannot cope without their support … [AQ] the variety of tasks may vary but can include practical household tasks, personal care (such as bathing etc) and emotional support. (www.carers.org 2015) [AQ]\r\n\r\nThe role of carers in the UK is recognised in legislation through the Care Act 2014, which details how local authorities are obliged to conduct carer assessments. Every carer is legally entitled to a carer assessment. Although caring relationships are often embedded within existing relationships (such as being a son or a wife), under the Care Act 2014, anyone who\r\n\r\nseems as though they may benefit from carer support is entitled to an assessment and is eligible for access to support services. The assessment is based on national criteria (there are separate laws about social care in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland [AQ]) and the aim is to ensure that all carers are properly supported and enabled to sustain their caring role. It is hoped that the Care Act 2014 might go some way towards increasing the attention paid to the needs of carers, although it has been reported that difficulties associated with the labelling, accessibility and appropriateness of services may in fact result in carers not seeking help or recognising their own needs and rights to access services. This is particularly likely to happen due to the immense demands placed on many carers (Wirral Carers Strategy 2005–2008 [AQ]). This chapter looks at some of the key issues for carers and makes recommendations for challenging discrimination and building anti-discriminatory practice.",

This qualitative study interviewed 8 remarried parents and 11 social workers to explore the remarriage experiences in Hong Kong. The findings reveal four themes of Hong Kong remarried couples: 1) reasons for remarriage and factors hindering remarriage decision; 2) relationship with stepchildren become the biggest challenges in remarried relationships; 3) psychological and cultural factors contribute to negative stepparent-child relationship; and 4) the transition of remarriage--social service implementations. The findings extend perspectives around the contextualization of remarriage in the Hong Kong Chinese culture. The core values of family harmony, blood and family ties, plus societal stereotypes, are revisited with reference to the Chinese culture. It is recommended that social workers demonstrate more cultural sensitivity in their practices and offer different services to support blended families.",

Burden is measured by assistance with the activities of daily living, attempts to prevent or stop troublesome behaviors, and worries about the client. The impact of continuity of care is evaluated for the total sample and in interaction with shared residence. Although continuity has no direct effect on any measure of burden, it can offset the objective burdens associated with shared residence. Without continuity of care, coresidence tends to increase the burden of caregiving and supervision. Client involvement in the professional system of care has less impact on family members when the client lives apart. The objective burden falls most heavily on spouses and parents; adult children and secondary kin are less affected.",

One can also think of person ality as doing something; that is, some aspects of personality can be thought of as organizing and guiding daily behavior.1 Individuals exhibit significant variation in the strivings, tasks, and goals that they see as im portant in their daily lives. These personal goals are derived in part from the tasks that cultural contexts present as important to address at points along the life course, but in dividuals interpret these tasks in line with their own motives and experi ences. For example, establishing in dependence from one's family is a common task following adolescence in many Western cultures. For one person, this task might implicate handling financial matters and housekeeping independently; for another, the task might involve deal ing with the loss of a valued support system; yet another individual may work on developing an identity free of the expectations of parents and siblings.2 We refer to these personal versions of culturally mandated goals as life tasks. These life tasks constitute the problems that indi viduals work toward solving in daily life, and our research examines these problem-solving efforts.",

This chapter provides a brief overview of the demography of ageing and then focuses on how societal structures and constructs influence older adults' experiences. Challenges of ageing are examined at a societal level, with a discussion of how providers, healthcare systems, and governments can address these challenges to optimize older adults' well-being. Older adults are prone to unique challenges and difficulties due to the physiology and societal expectations of ageing. Additionally, challenges common to the human experience impact older adults differently because of myriad factors, such as the accumulation of multiple chronic illnesses, high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, and a gradual loss of independence. Many older adults will require the assistance of caregivers due to disability or impairment from cognitive, psychiatric, or medical conditions.",

      "abstract": "Facing constraints to meaningful caring emerged as a significant aspect of the experience of caring explored in a larger hermeneutic phenomenological study of family practices, before, during and following the admission of an older relative to a nursing home. Hermeneutic analysis of in‐depth interview transcripts and observation field notes of 14 family carers' experiences disclosed six shared meanings: (i) being out of control; (ii) not being heard; (iii) experiencing barriers to sharing care with staff; (iv) feeling adrift, excluded and disempowered; (v) wanting to engage in caring partnership; and (vi) living in a constant state of anxiety. Concern is illuminated in the narrative of family carers' experiences of being misunderstood, and attempting to manage constraints imposed by institutional rules and care routines which threaten the quality of existence for themselves and their relatives. This paper challenges nurses to increase their awareness and acknowledgement of the importance of creating a context of care in which family carers may feel empowered to engage in meaningful caring activities and relationships.",

      "abstract": "The modern way of life, which is characterized by insufficient movement, most often leads to poor posture. Children and young people exercise less and less and spend more and more time in passive sitting and lying positions. Such habits take them away from their natural needs for movement (hypokinesis) and significantly reduce most of their physical and functional abilities. The question is why do so many children sit with such poor posture? Habit is one of the main reasons, but not the only factor of poor posture when sitting. The article especially discusses the environment factors that may indicate the causes of improper posture, and occur during school: several hours of sitting in school desks, a large number of classes, short breaks, dysfunctional and inadequate classroom furniture, insufficient lighting of the work surface, heavy school bags and improper way of carrying one. Due to the influence of various factors: family, preschools, schools, and others in the formation of proper posture, it is necessary to create a system of preventative measures from an early age, which includes educating children. Prevention not only affects school success but also changes the attitude towards oneself, peers, and other people, which contributes to the development of positive traits and characteristics of the person and their successful socialization.",

Strange Situation assessments of attachment security for the younger children (mean age = 1 year 10 months), Attachment Q-sort ratings of the older children (mean age = 4 years 8 months), and ratings of parental caregiving behavior of both children were obtained. Younger and older children developed concordant attachments to both parents. Parents were consistent in their caregiving behavior toward their 2 children. However, parents were not congruent in their attachment to their 2 children. Associations were found between maternal caregiving and attachment only in the younger group. The results support the idea that parental caregiving behavior accounts for only modest portions of the variance in attachment security; evolving attachments integrate developmental inputs from the children and the caregivers in the network of early family relationships.",

The family is the one that provides the essential affective climate so that there is a process that changes the biological being that is a baby, in a person, in a biopsychosocial being. Marriage arguments emotionally deplete parents and diminish their interest in the emotional needs of their children, who may understand it as rejection or absence of affection, very detrimental to their personal growth. Additionally, marital conflict decreases the parents ability to integrate and participate socially. The provision of affective and emotional stability that child development requires can be seriously threatened by the separation or divorce of the parents, it affects children in the form of coping they use in stressful situations, in the formation of the attachment process, the affective and emotional stability required for child development and how they respond to changes in the family.",

      "title": "Kids as Parental Property",
      "abstract": "You own a house in Illinois. You invite your significant other or your mom to live with you. You have a big fight with your roommate. You throw your former partner or your mom out of the house. You can usually do this because the house is your property, even if it means your house will be less clean.Alternatively, you are a single parent who invites your significant other or your mom to live with you and your kid in your house in Illinois. You allow your partner or your mom to assume significant childcare and housecleaning responsibilities. Your partner or mom does quite well in both caretaking and housekeeping. Perhaps you marry your partner. Regardless, then you break up with your partner, or have a big fight with your mom. You throw your former partner (or spouse) or mom out of your house and out of your kid’s life. You can do this because the house is your property and because you have superior parental rights regarding your kid’s continuing care.But should the limits on your control of your house differ from the limits on your control of your kid? Should it matter if you are a bad housekeeper or a bad parent? Your kid may sorely miss the childcare provided by your former partner (or spouse) or mom, but your house will never notice their absence, even if it is less clean. While fights and breakups will not prompt your diminished control over your home, should they sometimes prompt your diminished control over your kid? Should your former partner be eligible, upon request, to be deemed a second parent or a continuing nonparent child caretaker over your objection? Should your mom be eligible, upon request, to obtain a continuing contact court order with her grandchild over your objection?Reasonable people have varying opinions on when superior parental rights should yield to second parenthood, to former stepparent visitation, or to grandparent visitation. Outside of Illinois there are differing American state laws. Many of the differences elsewhere arose because of the changes in artificial insemination; marital stability; adultery; procreative sexual conduct; unwed households; and grandparent-grandchild relations. De facto parenthood, equitable adoption and comparable doctrines allow in some states for second parentage arising from earlier parental-like childcare though there are no biological ties or no formal adoptions. And former stepparents and/or grandparents may sometimes override parental objections when these nonparents pursue court-ordered childcare.Unfortunately, Illinois legislators have yet to debate fully and to resolve these important issues. In March, 2015, the Illinois Supreme Court declined to decide some of these issues in the case of In Re Scarlett Z.D.. It preferred Generally Assembly action.This article considers: What circumstances prompted a unanimous Illinois Supreme Court to act as it did? What has the Illinois General Assembly recently considered regarding these issues? And, what should the people of Illinois and their legislators do next if they wish to debate, and then perhaps facilitate, more continuing childcare serving the best interests of Illinois kids, even if over parental objections?",

      "abstract": "Understanding the psychological well-being of older individuals who work outside the home and have concurrent family roles is integral to the promotion a healthy, aging workforce. Maintaining these multiple roles may help shape aging identity, a perception of self over time and psychological resource in later life, with gender as a potential critical factor. Female and male workers 50+, with at least 1 of 4 family roles (spouse, parent of adult children, caregiver to a mother, and/or grandparent) were selected from the 2010 and 2012 Health and Retirement Study (n= 5,627). Dependent variables were positive and negative self-perceptions of aging. Independent variables were a) work/family rewards and stressors (job indices of satisfaction and stressors; perceived support from and negative interactions with spouse or adult children; caregivers’ perceived past relationship with their mother and assistance level; and grandparent’s leisure time with grandchild(ren) and grandchild care), and b) work-to-family and family-to-work enhancement/conflict. The impacts of each role reward/stressor on positive /negative self-perceptions on aging were assessed as direct effects and indirect effects through each type of work-family enhancement/conflict, by gender, in path analysis and multiple groups analysis (p < 0.05). Family and work roles, particularly their stressors, were directly related to aging self-perceptions (positive and negative). The indirect effects of work-family conflict were gendered: Work-to-family conflict pertained to women’s aging self-perceptions whereas family-to-work conflict pertained to men’s. Interventions to reduce role stressors and both work-to-family and family-to-work conflict may help retain older workers with family roles and promote their psychological well-being.",

Associations were studied among self-reported divisions of labor, coparenting observations, and child adjustment (Mage = 3 years) among 104 adoptive families headed by lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couples. Lesbian and gay couples reported sharing child care, whereas heterosexual couples reported specialization (i.e., mothers did more child care than fathers). Observations confirmed this pattern-lesbian and gay parents participated more equally than heterosexual parents during family interaction. Lesbian couples showed the most supportive and least undermining behavior, whereas gay couples showed the least supportive behavior, and heterosexual couples the most undermining behavior. Overall, supportive coparenting was associated with better child adjustment.",

Subjects were 24 white middle class boys and 24 girls and their divorced 'parents, from homes in which custody, had been granted to the mother, and the'same number of children and parents from intact homes. A multimethod approach, including interviews, observations, diary records, and personality measures, was used to assess parent characteristics, child characteristics / and family interaction. Parents and children were administeredthese measures at two months, one year, and two years following divorce. Results show that when a father leaves the home following divorce, the family system is in a state of disequilibrium. Disorganization,and disrupted family functioning seem to peak'at one yearfandbe restabilizing by two ears following the divorce. Stresses in family functioning following divorce are reflected not only in parent -child relations but in changes in life-style, emotional di$tress, and changes in attitudes toward the self of the divorced co4ple. It is suggested that these changes in the parents may be medi4ting factors in changes in the child's behavior.

O It may seem rather odd that the first paper on a symposium on fathers is dealing with fathers who are absent rather than present. However, I believe.a fruitful way of studying the role of the father andthe,impact of the father on,mothers and children is to examine changes in family interaction and functioning following a divorce in which the mother has been granted custody of the child. If you examine the literature on father absence carefully you will be struck by how little we know of factors that mediate differences found between children with absent or present fathers. We tend to rely very heavily on explanations based on modeling. How can children:particularly boys, be expected to exhibit normal cognitive and social development or sex role typing or self control,",

La vivencia de la sexualidad en la etapa adolescente, constituye el sustrato sobre el que se sustenta el futuro comportamiento sexual de la vida adulta. Asi mismo, constituye un indicador de riesgo-proteccion asociado a un mejor o peor pronostico de la salud reproductiva y sexual. La adolescencia en situacion de riesgo/conflicto social severo y prolongado configura un grupo poblacional caracterizado por un patron instaurado de conducta gravemente desadaptada. Conducta delimitada por lineas de alta fragilidad y vulnerabilidad social, cuando no de marginalidad, etiquetaje o estigma social. La conducta hipersexualizada como sena de identidad, constituye en estos/as adolescentes un mecanismo instrumental de adaptacion a un entorno que no les reconoce como sujetos autonomos e integrales. EnglishTeenage is a time of life where a great number of transitions take place, generating deep biological, psychological, social and moral transformations. Such transformations can, at the same time, generate crisis, conflicts and contradictions. The way sexuality is experienced during the teenage period shapes future sexual behaviour during adulthood. It is also a risk/protection indicator associated to a better or worse prognosis of their sexual and reproductive health. Teenagers within severe and prolonged social conflict or high risk situations are a group characterised by severely unadapt/dysfunctional behaviour patterns. Such behaviours are framed by extreme social fragility and vulnerability, if not by marginality or social stigma. Oversexualised behaviour as a sign of identity in these teenagers is a mean for adapting to an environment that does not recognise them as autonomous and integral subjects.",

The parents live for looking after their children in such as in their care and attention, and they avoid all types of problems. We found, principally children being overprotected in first-time, parents, single mothers, and separated families and those that work full time, the same one that deprive their children of their freedom in thinking and create in them instability, nervousness, fear, low self-esteem, breaking the rules, avoids their maturity, difficulty in the development of their learning, turns their children into passive subjects, defenseless, useless and dependent. Nowadays social, technological and behavior changes have placed school and family in a new situation, where the school is in charge of making the child a social being, fomenting them with ideas, values and good behaviors from the group that they belong to, meanwhile the family is responsible for transmitting values and attitudes that are proper to the society.

En los Estados Unidos, las fuerzas sociopolíticas más amplias se enfocan en el individualismo y no apoyan el desarrollo o mantenimiento de patrones culturales para los dominicanos.

      "abstract": "In this chapter I attempt to tease apart the meanings of various terms sometimes confusingly used in understanding the importance of second-person engagements in infant social cognition. Engagement itself may be a continuum rather than a category, may occur in a multiplicity of modes and dimensions rather than a singularity, and may occur with things as well as people. Nonetheless, the difference between second and third-person engagements is crucial for the development of infant social cognition (and possibly for social cognition through the lifespan). I discuss the importance of the second-person by looking at four attentional and intentional engagements in the first year—coy responses to attention, clowning and showing off, anticipatory adjustments to being picked up, and compliance with directives. Such phenomena portray early and fundamentally emotional involvement, requiring more than explanations of ostensive cues, child-directedness, or joint engagement occurring after joint attention.",

      "title": "Family proximity and relocations in older adulthood",
      "abstract": "The family remains one of the most important sources of support for older adults. Geographic proximity between family members has important implications for the growing demand for formal and informal care. As people age, their own and their family members’ residential (im)mobility may be a strategy to facilitate the exchange of care. Drawing on the full population register data from Norway and Sweden, this research addresses the following question: How are needs-related life circumstances of older people associated with their own and their relatives’ migration and immobility (including older adults’ moves into institutionalized care facilities)? The roles of a range of needs-related life circumstances of older adults in their own and their family members’ locational choice are documented: needs for formal care, severe health problems, the absence of core family members, or losing a partner recently. The overall answer to the research question is that older adults’ needs-related life circumstances deter intergenerational geographic divergence, and inspire moves toward adult children, siblings, and into institutionalized residential care. The results emphasize the importance of non-resident family members in migration and immobility both as a deterrent to moving into institutionalized care and elsewhere when family members live nearby and as an attraction to migrate toward clusters of relatives. The findings broadly suggest that even in Norway and Sweden where formal care services are available, the welfare state is far from “crowding out” the family from the sphere of care and the family plays an important role in the locational choices of older adults.",

      "title": "Family Response to Mental Illness",
      "abstract": "Family care has become an active area of research. Serious mental illness is typically a catastrophic stressor for families and is woven into the familial fabric in an enduring way. Patients do not exist in isolation and the impact of the mental disorder and its treatment is experienced by their caregivers as well. Caregivers experience various losses such as loss of finance, stigmatization and social exclusion, loss of sense of stability and control, of future hope, dreams and goals, and loss of relationships. These losses give rise to emotions that are intense, explosive and recurrent. Moreover, in the family various emotional issues are not confronted and often ignored as if by doing so, their reality could be undermined. Participants’ narratives highlighted that caregiving constituted a unique world. Going beyond the passive giving of support, caregiving is a multidimensional experience, entangled inextricably with the patient’s age and gender, and with the psychosocial characteristics of the illness- in this case it’s stigmatizing and long drawn nature and perceived intensity of illness. This book discusses wants and needs caregivers and how different groups of caregivers have",

      "abstract": "Fathers' and mothers' encouragement of sibling interaction was examined in two-child families when the younger sibling was 5 weeks old and the older sibling about 22 months old and then approximately 3 months later. Concordant with the theories of J. Block (1982) and J. H. Block (1983,1984), fathers' and mothers' own linguistic behaviour as well as their encouragement of their children's behaviour reflected gender-specific patterns with fathers demonstrating as well as encouraging more accommodative or agentic patterns and mothers demonstrating as well as encouraging more assimilative or communion- enhancing patterns. Among other things, fathers more actively directed the older sibling's attention to the younger sibling, particu larly when both children were female. Likewise, fathers more than mothers more often responded to male infants' rather than female infants' movements and sounds, thus giving young boys more contin gent responsiveness which is thought to promote mastery and indepen dence. On the other hand, mothers more often vocalized to, and tried to establish contact with, the infant, especially when the older sibling present was female. Parents vocalized more often to children when mothers were paired alone with the children and fathers were paired alone with them, suggesting the importance of participation in smaller, rather than larger, family groups for the development of productive language skills. Finally, parental vocalizations, particularly those directed to the older sibling, decreased substantially over time, while parental vocalization to the infant increased over time, suggesting concerns for the quality of home linguistic environment when more children are added to the family.",

      "abstract": "The study is based on interviews made with women who care for an elderly relative. The activities which they perform can be classified to five basic forms of assistance: basic care and nursing, psycho-social care, obligatory attendance, house keeping, and supporting contacts to the social environment. The relationships between these women and the elderly contain a certain amount of reciprocity, which is reflected in material and emotional gratifications for the person rendering help. The burdens on the helper result from constant awareness of the decrepitude of a relative, from fear of the future, and from the necessity of constantly being in attendance of a dependent person. Women who feel burdened by their tasks perceive few rewards from the relationship, and have the impression that the person being cared for has no adequate idea of the efforts made. Because of the burdens on the relatives, the continuation of care of the elderly in their familiar social environment remains precarious. This finding is not an argument against care in familiar surroundings, but it does call attention to the importance of mobile social services for stabilizing primary assistance.",

In most cases their children also experienced difficulties especially with regard to their schooling. The result of this thesis show a parental model which is less valued than that in a population made up of ordinary, non-problem families. The children's image of themselves reflects this low esteem. Certain of the children's statements clearly show that they relate negatively to society. Some have deficient perceptive concepts (relation to time, notions of education and upbringing, etc. . . ) some of these children may well, as adults, reproduce the same behaviour patterns of which they themselves are victims.",

The sample was studied by means of the Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS), and the Scale of Satisfaction with Work.The results showed that single mothers perceived and obtained significantly less social support than mothers in relationships, and they offered to their relatives much more protective support (p = 0.006). Satisfaction with work among mothers - regardless of the family status - grows if the mother receives more social support. The information support received by mothers in relationships is not significantly related to satisfaction with work; seeking that type of support by single mothers does not have a meaningful relationship with satisfaction with work, either. Moreover, regardless of the mothers' family status, satisfaction with work is significantly differentiated by each type of social support, except for protective support.Social support is differentiated by the mothers' situation in the family and at work, and it has a different impact on single mothers from the impact on mothers in relationships.

The line that virtually connects these two extremes, dependence and autonomy, covers a person's lifetime, and it characterizes the individual because of the constant presence of two interconnected elements that cannot be separated: the nutritional and the affective components. The type of nutrition received by the foetus triggers metabolic and developmental changes that are necessary for the foetus to adapt to the quality of life inside the uterus. The developmental cycle the individual embarks upon from birth in relation to eating habits relies on the constant alternation between internal and external contexts, where other elements, such as temperament, also contribute to etiopathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Problem. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if there is any relationship between the unique aspects of the pastoral family, the relationships of the PK, and his or her adult religious commitment. Method. The population included Seventh-day Adventist pastors' children (PKs) who were age 25 or older and whose fathers were ministers for at least 10 years before subjects were 18 years old. A survey was completed by 487 subjects. Data were analyzed using multiple-regression, correlational, and qualitative methods. Results. All variables unique to the pastoral home correlated significantly with measures of religious commitment--feelings towards moving (not actual number ofmoves), consistency of parental behavior, family time, ability to be oneself without being noticed, expectations perceived as greater than for others, the status of having a pastor as a father, and support of church and members. The strongest predictor ofweak religious commitment was the PK's perception that more was expected of him/her. Intimacy with each parent correlated positively with religious commitment. A satisfying parental marriage and relationships with friends and extended family correlated positively with some of the measures of religious commitment, although most correlations were extremely low. Qualitative analysis was consistent with the quantitative analysis and lent further support. Perception of expectations was the most frequently mentioned dislike, whereas people and friendships was the most liked. Attendance at special church events or meetings of the SDA church was viewed positively. Conclusion. The unique aspects of the clergy home and the experience of being a PK seem to be related to the religious commitment of the adult child of a minister, although not strongly. Influences other than being a PK appear to have a greater impact. Pastors' children have shared, strong feelings about their experience. Those PKs who were more religiously committed came from homes characterized by apositive parental relationship with positive spiritual role models, quality family time, freedom to be themselves, and boundaries between church and home.",

La deficiencia de estos factores determina la frecuencia de las defunciones tempranas. Estos factores se han clasificado en endógenos y exógenos, según su origen. Los primeros se refieren a la falta de viabilidad intrínseca para sobrevivir que proceden de la constitución del niño, sujeta a malformaciones eventuales y a las condiciones en que se desarrollan tanto el embarazo como el parto. Los factores exógenos abarcan todos aquellos de procedencia extrínseca como las infecciones, las intoxicaciones alimenticias y los accidentes. La mortalidad infantil es un indicador sensible a cualquier cambio en la estructura económico-social, en particular la mortalidad exógena condicionada a los factores más fácilmente controlables. Los factores endógenos pueden manifestar mejoría en las condiciones económicas y sociales, dado que en general se encuentran muy estrechamente ligados entre sí, aunque su sensibilidad para reflejar de inmediato los cambios es menor. Los países llamados desarrollados acusan una mortalidad infantil reducida; en cambio, aquellos que presentan bajos ingresos por habitantes y agudos problemas sociales se caracterizan por una elevada proporción de defunciones durante el primer año de la existencia. Por ello, la tasa de mortalidad infantil puede considerarse como buen indicador de la situación social de una determinada comunidad; tanto es así que la Secretaría de las Naciones Unidas recomienda su inclusión dentro de los indicadores demográficos utilizados para medir el nivel de vida alcanzado por los países.",

The current study evaluated attachment to parents as a possible explanation for discrepancies in psychological well-being. The results confirmed that attachment was a significant predictor of well-being. Additionally, individuals from stepfamilies were found to have less secure attachment to their parents than individuals from intact, biological families. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that attachment (operationalized as maternal and paternal care) partially mediated the relationship between family type (intact, biological family vs. stepfamily) and psychological well-being.",

Three groups were compared: children with (a) invisible friends, (b) companions who were personified objects (e.g., dolls), and (c) no imaginary companion. Results indicated that children differentiated the relationships in their social networks according to provisions. Parent-child relationships afforded instrumental help and siblings were associated with conflict. Provisions of real and imaginary friendships were similar, although imaginary friends were preferred as objects of nurturance. Results imply that 4-year-old children have developed differentiated relationship schemas and that those of children with invisible friends may be particularly distinct.",

In our Western societies, there is a general agreement that adolescents want to become autonomous as early as possible. The continuing investigation of households’ living conditions and its variable part concerning Education and the Family carried out by the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (2003) offers an opportunity to question this «obvious » fact. Thus it appears that not all middle and secondary school students between the ages of 10 and 23 have the same ideas about the age at which one can become autonomous ; those ideas are socially determined. On one hand, the fields in question (leisure activities, outings, shopping, clothes, sociability, school) give rise to aspirations to autonomy at varying ages (the activities relating to socialization outside the family and between peers being the most coveted ones), and on the other hand there are considerable variations depending on the young people’s social origin (which is approached by determining the socioprofessional category and educational level of the parents). Children from the lower classes indicate later ages for obtaining autonomy, and the mother seems to play a dominant role in this kind of parental influence, particularly in the light of her educational level, but not insignificant are also father’s professions or socio-professional categories.",

      "title": "From Family to Care: Issues for the Child",
      "abstract": "It is still widely held that the traditional or conventional nuclear family is the only suitable environment in which children can grow up and that any deviation from this norm puts children at a considerable disadvantage (Kahan, 1989). The vulnerability of children and young people coming into residential care in Ireland due to their dysfunctional family experiences, and how coming into residential care and their subsequent experience therein can sometimes further increase this level of vulnerability for the adolescent child has been well documented. This paper discusses the question: What can we, as residential child care workers and agencies, do to reduce the anxiety level of the vulnerable child coming into care, or at the very least, to ensure that this level of anxiety is not increased, during their admission and subsequent stay in care? Before I attempt to answer this question, it is important to point out that there are many aspects of residential care which can effect the vulnerable child. It is not possible in this short paper to consider all those aspects. However, I concentrate on those issues which I, as a social care practitioner, feel to be important.",

      "abstract": "The contributions of perceptions of childhood family of origin well‐being and self‐esteem to attitudes toward the divorced single mother among 170 college students were investigated. Participants came from two family types, including those who lived only with their biological parents (i.e., biological parents group), and those who lived at some time in their lives with a divorced single mother (i.e, divorced single mother group). In all hierarchical regression models tested, the control variables of participants’ gender, age, socioeconomic status, and family income, as well as the predictor variable of family type made no significant contributions to their attitudes toward the divorced single mother. Childhood perceptions of family of origin well‐being, however, significantly predicted more positive attitudes toward the divorced single mother, particularly for the biological parents group. On the other hand, self‐esteem made no significant contributions. In addition, forthe biological parents group, amount of interaction with single parent families significantly predicted more positive attitudes toward the divorced single mother, while for the divorced single mother group, amount of time lived in a single parent family headed by a divorced mother did not. Findings were discussed from the point of view of their implications for early childhood educators.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports the highlights of long-term dynamic psychotherapy with an African. The case is presented of a 34-year-old Nigerian exarmy officer with the onset of panic symptoms following the death of a neighbor. This event was found to symbolize the core of his conflicts. Therapy revealed ongoing conflict with his father, with peers at work and in his marriage. There were also violations of the incest taboos in his extended and polygamous family. The psychotherapeutic process is delineated with special reference to Oedipal components. The following variations are discussed: (i) the impact of a cultural setting which enforced infancy/early childhood domicile with mother, separate sleeping quarters for the father, and later separation of all males from mother; (ii) the dynamics of growing up in a home where father has multiple wives who may function as surrogate mothers in his lifetime or, at his death, as potential wives; (iii) the vicissitudes of the incest taboo in a complex extended family that is under siege by urbanization. The therapeutic experience contrasts sharply with the experience of western psychiatrists who practiced in Nigeria two decades before.",

Esta situacion representa un problema de salud publica emergente en las comunidades rurales con adultos mayores (AM), quienes son marginados por sus familiares, situacion que tiende a generalizarse en los proximos anos con el envejecimiento poblacional. Esto, aunado a los problemas de la capacidad fisica (CF) propios de los AM, requiere de mayor atencion de la familia, situacion que merece ser estudiada desde la perspectiva teorica del cuidado de enfermeria. Objetivo: Explorar y correlacionar la CF de los AM con el tipo de funcionalidad familiar en una comunidad rural, con base a la Teoria de Organizacion Sistemica de Friedemann (1995). Metodologia: Estudio exploratorio correlacional. Se encuestaron 100 familias con integrantes AM seleccionados por muestreo probabilistico. La informacion se recabo a traves de instrumentos validados como la Escala de Efectividad en el Funcionamiento Familiar y el Indice de Barthel, se realizo analisis con estadistica descriptiva e inferencial. Resultados: Mantenimiento del sistema familiar se correlaciono positivamente con la CF de movimiento y eliminacion (r=0.276, p=0.005 y r=0.284, p=0.004). Discusion y conclusiones: El mantenimiento del sistema, cambio del sistema e individuacion soportan la funcionalidad familiar; en este estudio quedo demostrado que estos conceptos predicen la CF del AM, con mayor importancia en la eliminacion y movimiento",

      "abstract": "AbstractThis study examines the adaptation of children in self-care compared with children in adult-care to out-ofschool relationship contexts and solitude. Thirty-six French children aged 9-11 years were interviewed about their out-afschool activities and responses to solitude. The theoretical framework integrates weiss’ (1974) notion of relational provisions and Ullsiner’s (1984, 1987) constraint theory to understand individual adaptation in the social and solitary contexts of self-care. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed complexity and variability of the strnctural organization and children’s adaptation in self-care contexts. Although self-care children reported more activities outdoors alone than did adult-care children, the development of the capacity to be alone may protect children’s psychological well-being. Moreover, the inherent structure of self-care, i.e., parental absence, demanded that children lead the promotion oftheir own development in self-care contexts. In a few extreme instances, children were indeed “homeless in the afternoon.”Key Words: self-care childrenlatchkey childrenrelational provisionssolitudesocial contexts Notes1 This study was carried out with the Self-Care Research Team including Professors Janine Beaudichon, Pierre Coslin, and Annick Cartron of the Laboratoire de Psychologie du Developpement et de L’educatfan de Uenfant, Universite Paris V, La Sorbonne and was funded by the French Ministry of Education.",

      "abstract": "Cette these est un effort de plus pour analyser le « phenomene de la devolution » pendant la periode de mise en relation, prenant en compte les raisons evoquees par les adoptants pour rendre les enfants et les effets sur les enfants et les adolescents. Nous comprenons que la connaissance des risques et l'evaluation des differents niveaux du processus d'adoption peuvent permettre des interventions qui reduisent les echecs dans la construction des nouveaux liens de filiation. L'objectif est d'analyser le phenomene par le versant psychique, en tenant compte de la complexite de la filiation adoptive. Nous emettons l'hypothese que l'adoption a tendance a echouer dans les cas suivants : il n’y a chez l'adoptant aucun desir legitime d'avoir un enfant (certaines demandes peuvent etre qualifiees de perverses) ; l'enfant ne correspond pas a l'enfant imagine et fantasme par les parents (considerant une certaine tension entre le desir de procreer et celui d'adopter) ; il y a une recherche de reparation par l’adoption ; les imagos parentaux inscrits chez l’enfant interferent dans le processus de filiation ; les equipes institutionnelles ne parviennent pas a evaluer les requerants, a accompagner la periode de mise en relation et / ou a preparer les enfants. Sur la base de la proposition methodologique de la metapsychologie, nous avons guide la recherche sur la construction de cas de 10 enfants et adolescents sur la base de dossiers, de procedures judiciaires (destitution, agrement et adoption) et d'entretiens avec des equipes des institutions d'accueil. Dans ce contexte, l'interface de la psychanalyse avec le droit a permis une meilleure comprehension et une reflexion plus large sur le theme. Nous nous appuyons dans notre etude sur l'enseignement de Lacan : le desir est essentiel pour nouer de liens avec l'autre. Il convient de noter que, malgre les nombreuses avancees dans le domaine de l’adoption, il reste encore beaucoup a faire, notamment en ce qui concerne la transformation des enfants et des adolescents en sujets de droit, comme changement de paradigme.",

This article discusses a number of major issues that arise from this failure, including: (1) the sometimes negative impact of gender-neutral rules in divorce upon women and children; (2) the ambiguity and inadequacy of property and support obligations between cohabitants; (3) the legal incidents of non-residential conjugal relationships; (4) the incomplete revolution in the status of gay and lesbian couples; (5) relationships in the post-divorce family, such as those between stepparents and their stepchildren; and (6) the many conflict of laws questions that arise from inconsistent treatment of these issues by different states.",

The psychic mechanisms behind these youngsters' flight from the loving grip of their parents to the conflicting situations which later traumatise them are described. The traumatic events following their choice of leaving the parental home were later unconsciously experienced as punishment—a direct consequence of the forbidden separation. Guilt problems otherwise within the normal range of development, here get a special colouring which can be recognised among others in the difficulties to establish a working-alliance with the therapist and problems in establishing intimate relationships later in life.",

Among white and black working-class and poor families, childrearing strategies emphasize the \"accomplishment of natural growth.\" All of the middle-class families engaged in extensive reasoning with their children, asking questions, probing assertions, and listening to answers. Similar patterns appeared in interviews and observations with other African American middle-class families. While in working-class and poor families, children are granted autonomy to make their own way in organizations, in the middle-class homes, most aspects of the children's lives are subject to their mother's ongoing scrutiny. Class position influences critical aspects of family life: time use, language use, and kin ties. Working-class and middle-class mothers may express beliefs that reflect a similar notion of \"intensive mothering,\" but their behavior is quite different.",

Which is reflected in the behavior and activities of today's teenagers such as the procedure for dressing, and even extramarital sex. Pre-marital sex as a result of adolescent association is now a terrible scourge for parents because premarital sex certainly correlates with unwanted pregnancies and criminal acts such as abortion. Teenagers are now more absorbed in modern life. Want to be free in an unlimited sense, such as sexual behavior that tends to be free is done without a legitimate marriage bond. Factors in the occurrence of premarital pregnancy in the village of Abiansemal Dauh Yeh Cani, District of Abiansemal, Badung Regency are (1) Internal (internal) factors, namely: psychological, lack of understanding of Hindu religious education; (2) External factors (outside self), namely: lack of control and attention from parents, social environment (community) and the progress of science and technology, bad influence of the environment&#x0D; Based on the problems in this study, the researcher reviews this research based on?

      "title": "Non-resident fatherhood : a qualitative study of fathers' perspectives, experiences and relationships in context",
      "abstract": "Non-resident fathers have frequently been discussed as a significant social and economic concern for contemporary society. However, whilst non-resident fathers have arguably become visible in social welfare and policy agendas, relatively little is known academically about the lived experiences of these fathers in the UK. Previous research in this area has tended to focus either on the problematic nature of so called ‘absent’ fathers or on the financial responsibilities of non-resident fathers. Through a focus on the lived experience of non-resident fathers, this research developed a broader understanding of fathers’ perspectives, experiences and relationships, with an appreciation to their circumstances such as socio-economic status, family relationships and employment.\r\n\r\nSemi-structured interviews conducted with a diverse sample of 26 non-resident fathers who had ongoing contact with their children led to a wealth of insight into topics such as: similarities and differences between resident and non-resident fatherhood; building, restoring and strengthening of father-child relationships in post-separation families; negotiation and construction of fathering identities; and the balancing of romantic and social relationships with fathering. This thesis highlights how fathers’ circumstances, most significantly their housing situation, their contact schedule with their children and interpersonal relationships strongly interact with, and at times hinder, their desired wishes for care and parenting. Findings within this thesis show that traditional attitudes toward the family that centre upon a one-family household model still dominates thinking within policy-making and practice relating to children and families. This marginalises non-resident fathers, at times not recognising their fathering practices, and fails to recognise that many children live in more than one home. Through its exploration of non-resident fathers’ perspectives, this thesis draws several new and interesting conclusions relevant to sociological discussions of contemporary families as well as providing suggestions for improved social policy for separated families in the UK.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is hypothesized that in this century a pattern of three generations of adoptive parents has developed: the traditional-closed generation, the open-idealistic, and the materialistic-realistic generation. These three generations differ considerably in motives and attitudes concerning adoption. Changes in the adoption field are connected with important changes in society. Adoption has lost its taboo character, domestic adoption is decreasing or has almost vanished (Scandinavia, The Netherlands) and interracial adoption has started. Several figures illustrating changes in adoption patterns during the period 1960–1995 support the hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "This study's purpose was to investigate young adults' perceptions of grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. Over 1,200 young adult volunteers (M age = 21) read a randomly assigned scenario describing a grandparent raising a grandchild. Scenarios varied in terms of grandchild gender, grandparent ethnicity, the presence/absence of grandchild problems, and the reason for the assumption of the grandparent caregiving role. Results suggested that perceptions of custodial grandparents varied across reason for role assumption, wherein the most negative perceptions were tied to less socially acceptable circumstances for the assumption of the grandparent role (e.g., child abuse, drug abuse, abandonment). In addition, perceptions varied in terms of whether the grandparent was raising a problematic child. These data suggest that in varying degrees young adults may perceive custodial grandparents differently dependent on the life circumstances of the grandparent.",

      "abstract": "Sociality in rodents means a family-group mode of life. Factors promoting pair-bonding and biparental care appear to be of crucial importance for evolution towards sociality. Social species differ from solitary ones because of a higher rate and lasting duration of tactile contact between mates (brooding and grooming) and direct care of young exhibited by both parents (especially brooding, huddling over and grooming pups). The results of my studies support the hypothesis that additional tactile stimulation of pups by parents, as well as limitation of such stimulation, can lead to substantial alteration of their subsequent behavior, especially parental one. Behavioral alteration caused by limitation of tactile stimulation was found to be expressed by weakening of pair-bonds and reduced paternal care. Tactile stimulation is considered a proximate mechanism promoting pair-bonding and a higher rate of paternal care. Paternal investment expressed by direct care of young seems to be an essential factor responsible for the evolution towards sociality in rodents.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKey words: Rodents, sociality, tactile stimulation, evolution.",

Five interrelated parenting themes emerged from a narrative analysis of individual semistructured interviews that each father deemed important: (a) nurturance and emotional intimacy with children, (b) politically conscious parenting, (c) nonviolent discipline, (d) supportive social arrangements, and (e) open attitudes concerning who can parent a child. Each man’s personal commitment to feminist principles reflected how his parenting went beyond wanting the best for his child and included what was best for women, African American communities, broad societal change, and the psychosocial development of African American men. The findings offer practical insights and recommendations for understanding the best practices of some African American fathers who connect with their children despite societal barriers.",

      "title": "Identity Crisis among Early Adolescents in Relations to Abusive Experiences in the Childhood, Social Support and Parental Support",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONIdentity development is a lifelong process that begins in childhood and extends till old age. Identity formation has many components - physical, sexual, social, vocational, moral, ideological, and psychological characteristics (Rice, 1999). Many series of conflicts are involved in the process. Adolescence is a period when individuals examine identity as a process of finding out the fidelity in them, with reference to their peers. Orientation about the society they have to survive here gets redefined, from a world of parents and relatives who always attended them, to the world of peers who would attend them in special situations only.Adolescence is a period when individuals become confused about their personal strengths and weaknesses, and does not have a well articulated sense of self. This temporary instability and confusion, this distress and disorientation, resulting from conflicting pressures and uncertainty about one's self and one's role in society, usually experienced by the individuals during the period of adolescence is called identity crisis (Erikson, 1970). Everyone experiences this crisis during adolescence period, although in many cases this could be unconscious (Erikson, 1963). It is a necessary turning point, a crucial moment, when development must move one way or another, marshaling resources of growth, recovery, and further differentiation (Erikson 1968).It is in 1960's researchers started to note that there are at least some who do not experience this crisis. Marcia (1966), in this juncture, introduced a new outlook on identity formation which includes two phases - phase of crisis and phase of commitment. In crisis phase, individuals explore alternatives whereas in commitment phase, they exhibit personal investment for the resolution of the crisis (Santrock, 2005). In order to achieve a mature identity one has to have experienced a crisis and has to have shown commitment in the ideology that resolves the crisis (Marcia, 1966). Identity, here, is ego driven, internal, self-constructed and dynamic organization of aspirations, skills, beliefs, and individual history (Meeus, 1993).Identity develops through four qualitatively distinct statuses: diffusion, foreclosure, moratorium and achievement (Marcia, 1980). Marcia (1966) set up a typology for understanding how adolescents and young adults deal with the problems they face during the conflicts of Identity v. Role Confusion.In the status of identity diffusion, adolescents do not face any crisis, nor would they have any commitment. They live for the moment and are undecided about their occupational and ideological choices (Santrock, 2005). They do not have a committed identity and do not attempt to have one.In the status of identity moratorium, adolescents do face crisis, but they have not yet committed to any certain identity. They are undergoing crisis and are actively searching for an identity. They are often thoughtful individuals, open to experimenting with new ideas and lifestyles (Baumeister, 1986).Identity Foreclosed adolescents commit to an identity without experiencing any crisis i.e. they blindly accepts the identity that has been handed to them, usually by families and significant others. Here, the adolescents do not explore different approaches, ideologies, but accepts the predetermined identities that their parents give them.Identity achieved adolescents have undergone crisis and made a commitment (Santrock, 2005). They explore different options and confidently commits to an ideology that fits them. They know not only who they are, they know how they became that, and that they had a hand in the becoming (Marcia, 1991).The evaluation of the recognition an individual receives from his former small society (of the parents and close relatives) in comparison to the larger society (of the peers) motivates her or him to get separated emotionally from the parents and to make basic decisions about the values, goals, and ambitions (Blos, 1962; Baumeister, 1986). …",

      "title": "Caring Households: The Social Ties that House",
      "abstract": "Individuals turn increasingly to informal and family welfare to secure housing as housing and household pressures mount in advanced homeownership societies. This article sheds light on the role of less visible, less considered relations (beyond intergenerational assistance) that are currently being marshalled by low and middle-income households in Melbourne (Australia) and showcases the under-explored breadth of dependencies that exist between co-resident non-spousal adults. Drawing on in-depth interviews, it drills within the \"giver/receiver\" model to reveal diverse (inter)dependencies within families (e.g. filial, intergenerational, sibling), and between non-related, non-spousal adults (e.g. platonic, professional, e.g. AirBnB). It shows how these bidirectional transactions involve often ambiguous, asymmetrical (i.e. not-like-for-like) exchanges of material and emotional support, which are often postponed. Associated uneven power dynamics are shown to script the domestic space of these cohabiters, variously structuring householders' use, their (perception of) control and sense of home, and also to introduce tension, including threats to household stability. Others have identified a contemporary paradox: at a time when much policy and economic practice assumes subjects liberated from the obligations of social ties, individuals rely more than ever on intimate relations. This article builds on this curiosity identifying a broad range of social ties, including beyond the family, that are essential to helping city residents stay housed. It argues that as individuals grapple with welfare shifts, financial insecurity, and housing pressures, these ties take on heightened significance but they can also be tested: the pressures that housing-related dependencies place on coresident individuals have the potential to be highly gendered and, promises and expectations of reciprocity in particular, may become untenable for some individuals to uphold in the future.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Theory and research suggest that the transition to parenthood is a major life transition, and that adaptation to the parenting role is influenced by a complex set of factors, including the relationship with the child's mother, family of origin, and how the father is situated within sociocultural contexts. The father–]mother relationship is particularly important for men making the transition to fatherhood. This study examined patterns of fathering among young fathers (15–24 years) and investigated how fathers' relationships with the mothers of their young children (infants and toddlers) were related to fathering. In general, higher quality father–mother relationships were related to greater father involvement with children; when mothers were perceived as barriers to involved fathering fathers also had less accurate and adaptive parenting knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Person-centered analyses revealed quite complex relations between father–mother relationships and father–child interaction. One pattern showed strong positive father–mother relationships associated with a disengaged pattern of father–child interaction, while another pattern showed sensitive and positive father–child engagement in the context of negative or distant father–mother relationships. Four patterns of association between fathering and mother–father relationships were demonstrated. Results highlight the complexity of understanding fathering and family relationships among young fathers.",

They do it in various ways, using social work methods, from which most frequently used are methods of dealing with an individual or a group (family). To realise the given tasks, they use the environment organization method the least commonly. One of the reasons for social exclusion of an individual is the absence of an accurate diagnosis of reasons for isolation of individuals from other people functioning in their social zone. They lock themselves in their homes, isolate from living in wider social circles. It leads to the feeling of loneliness, to being lonely. This state is mostly experienced by elderly people who, undoubtedly, have to be of interest of social workers, because the quality of life of elderly people will depend on their tasks organization skills.",

The purpose of this study was to explore caregivers’ perceptions of the crises that preceded and were resolved by relocation during end-of-life care. In-depth interviews were conducted with 36 caregivers of people who died in a hospice house. The results illuminate a conceptual model of the caregiving crisis, which has three stages: a) precipitating factors — the interrelationship between illness trajectory and reciprocal suffering (physical, psychological, emotional and social distress), b) crisis, and c) resolution (settled or unsettled). Relocation presents an opportunity for families to relinquish the burden of end-stage care so that they can resume and complete a lifelong relationship. Careful recognition of and attention to the intimate dynamics that accompany suffering and dying are essential elements of palliative care, which aims to uphold the dignity of the dying person and the integrity of the family in both caregiving and bereavement.",

      "abstract": "The technological advances of modern society mean that family members have expanded obligations to care for newborns with severe impairments, who would have died in previous eras. This biological imbalance has created a moral one as well, for to care is to be penalized. Often this moral heroism can be sustained as a vacation only in communities based on the ideal of Christian love. Severely impaired children impose great physical and emotional stress on their parents, which can push the parents to the limits if they are unable to tap into altruistic emotions. Historically, children were not accorded moral status in the West until the Christian influence brought them into the moral community and encouraged parental responsibility. To fulfill their obligations, perhaps parents should bring their child with impairments home and relinquish care only when they find the burden too great. They are obligated to try because they brought the child into existence (biological-causal argument), because this caring is a reflection of God's image, and because children have a moral claim on their parents. Limits to parental obligations exist when continued care would be psychologically destructive for the parents, would conflict with obligations to other family members, particularly siblings, or would be harmful to the child because the atmosphere is no longer nurturing and loving.",

      "abstract": "Attachment is a lasting psychological connection between two or more people who have strong emotional ties and who try to maintain these relationships. Attachment is formed in the earliest part of childhood between primary caretaker and child. Based on their relationship, child can develop a secure and insecure attachment, or no attachment at all. Insecure styles of attachment can be divided into avoidant, ambivalent and disorganized style of attachment. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the development of attachment in children who grow up in children's homes. It can be concluded that children's homes are not the most appropriate form of care for the proper development of child attachment. Children who grow up in children's homes are separated from their parents, which results in the loss of attachment towards their parents. Children's homes cannot provide the child with a family environment, which is why the children who grow up in children's homes are more likely to develop an unsecure attachment. For the child to develop a secure attachment, it is essential to have an ongoing relationship with an adult, which is mostly impossible to achieve in children's homes because there are a lot of educators and they are frequently changed. That is why it is better for a child to be accommodated in a foster family, where it is more likely to develop a secure attachment.",

      "title": "Grandparents as Parents: An Ecological Approach to Programming",
      "abstract": "Grandparents are being recycled as parents. Millions of grandparents have returned to the role of parent. Events such as divorce, loss of job or home, the death or incarceration of an adult child with children, or a teen pregnancy may abruptly propel a grandparent into a caregiving role. Grandparents may also step in when the needs of children go unmet for a period of time because of underlying situations such as child abuse, AIDS, substance abuse, and even the effects of welfare reform. (Becklund, 1993; De Toledo & Brown, 1995; Jendrek, 1994; and Yorkey, 1993). While the idea of children living with grandparents is not new, the frequency of grandparent care has increased and the reasons for this phenomenon have changed.These problems, and others, continue to increase the stress on families, and particularly the extended family. Any one of these conditions can seriously strain the ability of family members to sustain the integrity of the family system, and many times multiple conditions further compound the difficulties. Grandparents are called upon in increasing numbers to provide support and assistance to families in need of outside help (Burton, 1992; Creighton, 1991; Minkler, Driver, Roe & Bedeian, 1993; Minkler & Roe, 1993). This support and assistance now often involves full-time parenting of grandchildren.Over three million children currently live with their grandparents in a home where no biological parent is present. This represents a two-thirds increase in numbers during the past decade (Children's Defense Fund, 1997). In terms of actual numbers, Caucasian children represent the greatest sector of the population. Proportionately, however, over one child in eight from African-American families lives with a grandparent as head-of household, and in Hispanic families the ratio is one in sixteen. Grandparent-headed families with young children are found in approximately one in twenty five American households (U.S. Census Bureau, 1991).New Family TypeElder individuals have always played an important part in extended family support roles. Recently, however, the large numbers of parents who are failing, for one reason or another, to effectively parent and meet the developmental needs of their children have given rise to an increasing number of skipped generation families. In these families the biological parents are absent from the home over an extended period of time, and grandparents have had to step in to serve as the sole or primary caregivers for their grandchildren (Jendrek, 1993; Strom & Strom, 1993). Court systems may look to grandparents as an alternative to foster placement, and grandparents may assume a primary caretaker role out of a sense of responsibility or affection for the grandchildren. In many instances, a surviving grandparent must function as a single parent. The number and commonality of this kind of household has developed into a new and rapidly growing family typology (De Toledo & Brown, 1995; Smith, Dannison & Vacha-Haase, 1998).The stress that grandparents experience as repeat parents is quite different from the routine kinds of stress usually associated with raising children. Many of the grandchildren have substantial unmet physical, developmental, and emotional needs, and share an orientation toward and a history of family crisis that is different than the world of grandparents (Smith & Dannison, 1998). Often, grandparents are encouraged by social service agencies or courts involved with the parent(s) of these children to become custodial caregivers for one of several young siblings. Limited public funding often pressures agencies to place at-risk children with relatives to avoid more costly out-of-family placements (Dannison & Nieuwenhuis, 1996).Many grandparent caregivers find their personal resources stretched to the limit. Issues of health, financial stability, and parenting are salient to these individuals. Almost one-half of those caring for grandchildren are grandmothers without partners (Creighton, 1991) and serving as primary caretaker for more than one dependent is not unusual (Minkler & Roe, 1993). …",

      "title": "Social Support for Divorced Fathers’ Parenting: Testing a Stress‐Buffering Model*",
      "abstract": "Abstract: A stress‐buffering hypothesis for parenting was tested in a county‐representative sample of 218 divorced fathers. Social support for parenting (emergency and nonemergency child care, practical support, financial support) was hypothesized to moderate effects of stress (role overload, coparental conflict, and daily hassles) on fathers’ quality parenting. No custody fathers relied more on relatives compared with custodial fathers, who relied more on new partners for parenting support. No differences by custody status were found on levels of support or parenting over time. Parenting support buffered effects of change in role overload and coparenting conflict on coercive parenting and buffered effects of change in daily hassles on prosocial parenting. Buffer effects were more predictive over time. Implications for practice and preventive intervention strategies are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Anak tunanetra memiliki keterbatasan yang berdampak pada pengalaman, bergerak dalam lingkungan, dan interaksi sosial. Keterbatasan tersebut dapat diminimalisir dengan perlakukan dari keluarga terutama orangtua. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk memperoleh gambaran perlakuan orangtua dalam mendidik anak tunanetra yang memiliki keterampilan sosial yang masih rendah. Pendekatan penelitian yang digunakan adalah kualitatif, dengan metode deskriptif. Subjek penelitian adalah anak tunanetra yang memiliki keterampilan sosial yang rendah. Teknik pengumpulan data yang dilakukan adalah observasi, wawancara, dan dokumentasi. Hasil penelitian sesuai dengan yang dikemukakan oleh Kartono (dalam Hasnawati, 2013, hlm. 440) ‘keluarga adalah tempat di mana anak mengawali belajar dan menyatakan diri sebagai mahluk sosial’. Jenis pola asuh yang diberikan orangtua berdasarkan temuan di lapangan adalah demokratis, akan tetapi pengasuhan tidak hanya diberikan oleh orangtua, namun diberikan oleh nenek dan pengasuhnya. Pengasuhan yang diberikan nenek dan pengasuhnya sebagai pengganti peran orangtua tidak selalu sesuai dengan apa yang seharusnya diberikan oleh orangtua kepada anak, terutama yang akan berpengaruh pada keterampilan sosial. Pola asuh yang kurang tidak lain dikarenakan kurangnya waktu yang dimiliki orangtua untuk bersama dengan anak. Faktor penghambat yang mempengaruhi pola asuh orangtua untuk mengembangkan keterampilan sosial anak yaitu, dampak ketunanetraan yang dimiliki anak, orangtua yang tidak tinggal serumah, dan pengetahuan orangtua mengenai ketunanetraan serta lingkungan tempat tinggal anak yang kurang mendukung. Upaya yang dilakukan orangtua dalam rangka mengembangkan keterampilan sosial anak adalah mengajarkan anak beberapa keterampilan, yaitu keterampilan berkomunikasi, keterampilan membuat humor, keterampilan menjalin persahabatan, dan keterampilan berperan dalam kelompok, serta keterampilan bersopan santun dalam pergaulan. Pola asuh orangtua memberikan kontribusi yang besar dalam mengembangkan keterampilan sosial anak tunanetra usia dini. \r\n\r\n;---Children who are blind have disability that impact on their experience, taking part in the environment, and social interaction. The disability can be minimised by familie’s treatment, especially parents. Thus, this research is aimed to gain an overview of the parent’s treatment in educating low social skills blind children. The research approach is qualitative, descriptive methods. Research subjects were blind with low social skills. Data collecting technique used are observation, interviews, and documentation. The results are in accordance with the proposed by Kartono (in Hasnawati, 2013, p.440) ‘The family is the place where the child begins to learn and declares himself a social being’. The type of parent parenting usually given is democracy, in fact, parenting should not only be given by the parents, but also by grandmothers and caregivers. Caregiving are given by grandmother and their caregiver as a substitute for parental roles, is not always according to what is supposed to be given by a parent to their child, especially one that would affect their social skills. The less of parenting is mostly caused by parents’ lack of time to be with their child. The restricting factors that affect parents’ parenting to develop children's social skills are their children blindness, the children living with other family or dorm, and the parents’ knowledge of blindness as well as the unsupportive neighbourhood environment. Parental efforts in developing children's social skills can be done by applying some skills, such as, training their communication skill, growing their sense of humor, making friendship and networking, and group role playing a as well as teaching them good behavior and attitude. Parents parenting gives great contribution in developing early age blind children social skills.",

      "abstract": "Child protection systems have always sought to respond to the interests of vulnerable children. Protective paradigms have changed over time as the ‘best interests’ of vulnerable children are defined in different ways. Within protective systems we are currently debating how best to provide children at risk with security and stability: should we seek to reunify them with their birth families or seek alternative options for their permanent care? The debate is unlikely to lead to an either/or option, but rather one where we need to consider many complex factors in both the decision-making process and how to implement these decisions. These factors include: the rationale and process for decision-making; the importance of timing (child's, parent's, carer's, service system and legal system); how to meet the child's heightened developmental needs before, during and following this process; the importance of the child's identity; and the level and type of real-life support needed (by either the birth family or permanent care providers) on the ground. It is also about the relationships needed to provide children with the foundation of a secure base and a safe haven so they can learn that adults can provide comfort, safety and a base upon which they can learn to explore the world.",

      "abstract": "The experience of parenthood is examined from a life-span developmental perspective, and within this framework, normative parenting is contrasted with nonnormative parenting. Our nonnormative example pertains to parenting a child with mental retardation. We emphasize that both normative and nonnormative parenthood are lifelong commitments, with shifting roles, responsibilities, and relationships that emerge as parents and children age. Our focus is on the consequences of these changing experiences for the well-being of parents themselves, and on how such consequences vary depending on whether parenthood is experienced in the typical or atypical case. We argue that, in both cases, there is need to establish the life-course connections across the early, middle, and later years of parenthood. The lack of theoretical and empirical inquiry during the middle years is given particular emphasis. We also discuss the 2need to consider individual differences in the parental experience, changing patterns of reciprocity in parent–child relationships, and historical and/or cohort influences on the experience of parenthood.",

      "abstract": "Objectives The objective of this systematic review is to identify the range of safety issues and experiences of safety issues that arise for seniors living independently in the community with respect to therapeutic self‐care and personal self‐care. Questions 1. What are the potential safety issues for seniors who engage in self‐care in their home community setting? 2. What are the potential safety issues related to activities of daily living? 3. Is there a distinction between adverse events resulting from therapeutic self‐care and selfcare related to activities of daily living in this population? 4. What is the experience of seniors living at home in dealing with adverse events resulting from self‐care behaviours? Inclusion Criteria Types of participants This systematic review will consider studies that address community‐dwelling seniors (65 years of age and older) who live alone or with others, but who have the capacity to and do engage in self‐care. Although studies may include younger participants, the average age of participants should be 65 years and older. Data from studies may be collected from seniors themselves, family members, formal and informal caregivers, including healthcare practitioners or from community organizations. Includes seniors who may have ongoing or occasional assistance with therapeutic or personal care, but who are able to direct such care. Data generated from studies of institutional settings or from those who are unable to direct their care because of impaired cognition will be excluded. Types of intervention This systematic review will focus on safety issues for seniors who engage in self‐care behaviours that are related to therapeutic regimes or daily living activities. The phenomena addressed in qualitative studies will be the experience of seniors living at home in dealing with adverse events resulting from self‐care behaviours. Types of outcomes Outcomes of interest for this study include: the occurrence of illness, accidents or adverse events related to self‐care; the nature of the adverse event; the impact of this adverse event on the health/well‐being of the individual and/or family/caregivers; the capacity of individuals/family to recognize adverse events when they occur; the capacity of individuals to deal with adverse events.",

A redução da densidade de animais de companhia nas ruas é uma excelente alternativa para a minimização da transmissão de doenças entre animais e humanos, sendo de grande relevância para o controle de zoonoses. A fim de garantir proteção, defesa e assegurar os direitos dos animais, a castração assume um importante papel, pois além de reduzir a reprodução, facilita a adoção responsável, visto que animais castrados são mais adotados quando comparados a animais não castrados. Como muitos indivíduos são abandonados em locais públicos e vivem em condições precárias, sendo sujeitos a maus tratos, esses animais proporcionam um aumento da curva populacional, o que culmina com o comprometimento de eixos como: fome, aumento na transmissão de doenças, ocorrência de acidentes automobilísticos ou por mordedura e redução na qualidade de vida de fêmeas prenhas e/ou com filhotes. A mensuração da eficiência das ferramentas de controle atualmente ainda é considerada uma fragilidade, visto que os dados acerca do número de animais esterilizados são escassos, mesmo com a introdução de programas de esterilização.",

      "title": "Perceived partner responsiveness across the transition to parenthood: The role of attachment insecurity",
      "abstract": "During challenging periods like the transition to parenthood, support from one’s partner becomes of vital importance for maintaining a healthy relationship. Responsiveness describes that relationship partners attend to and react in a supportive manner to one’s disclosed concerns and feelings in times of need. Perceived partner responsiveness occurs when one partner acts in a way that the other partner perceives as responsive to his or her needs, conveying understanding, validation, and care. However, such perceptions are highly subjective and shaped by attachment orientations of the perceiver, especially during challenging times. Besides, when partner behavior is perceived as responsive, this can also be beneficial for the relationship and promote a sense of security. The current study examined whether attachment insecurities predicted changes of perceived partner responsiveness across the transition to parenthood, and whether perceived partner responsiveness predicted changes in attachment orientations across time. We investigated changes in perceived responsiveness in 120 mixed-gender couples across the transition to parenthood over four different time points (during pregnancy, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months after the birth of their first child). The results suggest that although perceived responsiveness increased during the transition to parenthood, the increase was significantly less strong in individuals who scored higher in attachment insecurities. Additionally, examination of changes in attachment orientations shows significantly less increases of attachment insecurities when individuals perceived their partner’s responsiveness across the transition to parenthood.",

      "abstract": "Beginning with the story of Bluebeard, the author considers how traumatic overwhelm can occur in everyday childhood situations of a psychically murderous quality; for example, a nanny's totalitarian regime may be invisible to parents ruled by collective social and cultural norms. A child who is remote from mother and idealises a father embodying a powerful patriarchal system may remain naïvely dependent in marriage and unable to cope with the realities of human aggression. The paper describes analytic work with a woman who had suffered repeated breakdowns and needed to relinquish a fragile, socially constructed identity in order to establish her own true orientation.Prenant pour point de départ l’histoire de Barbe Bleue, l’auteur examine comment le débordement traumatique peut se produire dans l’enfance dans des situations de tous les jours qui ont une qualité psychique meurtrière. Par exemple, le régime totalitaire d’une assistante maternelle (nourrice) peut être invisible aux yeux de parents régis par des normes collectives sociales et culturelles. Un enfant émotionnellement à distance de sa mère et qui idéalise un père incarnant un système patriarcal puissant peut rester dépendant d’une manière naïve étant marié et incapable de se débrouiller de la réalité de l’agressivité humaine. L’article décrit le travail analytique avec une femme qui a vécu des dépressions à répétition et qui devait renoncer à une identité fragile, construite selon des normes sociales, afin d’établir son orientation personnelle authentique.Ausgehend von der Geschichte von Blaubart betrachtet die Autorin, wie traumatische Überwältigungen von psychisch mörderischer Qualität in alltäglichen Situationen der Kindheit auftreten können. Zum Beispiel mag das totalitaristische Regime einer Kinderfrau für Eltern unsichtbar sein, die ihrerseits von kollektiven sozialen und kulturellen Normen bestimmt sind. Ein Kind, das fern der Mutter ist und einen Vater idealisiert, der ein mächtiges patriarchales System verkörpert, kann in der Ehe naiv abhängig bleiben und unfähig sein, mit den Realitäten menschlicher Aggression fertig zu werden. Der Aufsatz beschreibt die analytische Arbeit mit einer Frau, die wiederholt Zusammenbrüche erlitten hatte und eine fragile, sozial konstruierte Identität aufgeben mußte, um ihre eigene wahre Orientierung zu finden.Iniziando con la storia di Barbablù, l’autrice considera come una inondazione traumatica, con una qualità potenzialmente omicida, possa avvenire in situazioni quotidiane dell’infanzia; per esempio, il regime totalitario di una bambinaia può essere invisibile a genitori guidati da norme sociali e culturali. Un bambino distante dalla madre e che idealizza un padre che incarna un potente sistema patriarcale, può rimanere ingenuamente dipendente nel matrimonio e incapace di affrontare le realtà dell’aggressività umana. L’articolo descrive il lavoro analitico con una donna, che aveva sofferto ripetuti crolli ed aveva bisogno di rinunciare ad una identità fragile, costruita per la società, al fine di definire il proprio vero orientamento.Начиная со сказки про Синюю Бороду, автор рассматривает, как травматическая охваченность убийственного для психики качества может случиться в повседневной жизни ребенка. Например, тоталитарный режим, введенный няней и невидимый для родителей. Ребенок, который удален от матери и идеализирует отца - носителя мощной патриархальной системы, может оставаться наивно зависимым в браке и не уметь справляться с человеческой агрессией. В статье описана аналитическая работа с женщиной, которая страдала от повторяющихся эмоциональных срывов. Ей было необходимо отказаться от хрупкой, социально сконструированной идентичности, чтобы установить свои подлинные ориентиры.Comenzando con la historia de Barba Azul, la autora considera cómo una devastación traumática puede ocurrir en situaciones cotidianas de infancias con cualidades de asesinato psíquico; por ejemplo, el régimen totalitario de una abuelita puede resultar invisible a los padres regulados por normas colectivas sociales y culturales. Un niño controlado por la madre y que idealiza a un padre que representa un sistema profundamente patriarcal, puede permanecer ingenuamente dependiente del matrimonio e incapaz de hacerle frente a las realidades de la agresión humana. El artículo describe el trabajo analítico con una mujer que sufrió repetidas crisis y necesitó renunciar a una frágil identidad, socialmente construida para poder establecer su propia y verdadera orientación.文章以蓝胡子的故事作为开始, 作者讨论了创伤性的压制可以出现在童年日常情境中, 表现为心理谋杀的特性。比如, 在集体社会和文化规范统治之下的父母可能看不出保姆所持有的极权主义状态。远离母亲并把父亲理想化的孩子, 体现了一个有力的父权体系, 它会维持对婚姻天真的依赖, 无法应对人类攻击性的事实。文章描述了和一位女性的分析性工作, 她重复性地经历了崩溃的状态, 她需要放弃一个脆弱的、被社会建构的身份, 以便于建构她自己的真实取向。.",

      "title": "Assessment of Caregiver Burden in Families of Persons with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, unpredictable, progressive, disabling disease. It is generally diagnosed in young adult females between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Symptoms of MS may include profound fatigue, depression, gait disorder, spasticity, blurred vision, and bladder and bowel problems. It is an unpredictable disease and has the potential to create a stressful family life. Because MS is frequently diagnosed in early adulthood, it may affect developmental experiences such as raising a family and building and sustaining a career. Satisfaction with relationships can also be altered. MS has a significant social, psychological, and physical impact on the affected individual as well as his or her family. Partners of people with MS often become caregivers, adding to the demands and challenges of family life. As the individual's disease progresses, the capacity for self-care may decrease, and the individual may require daily assistance from family members. However, the daily assistance that family members provide to a disabled spouse, parent, partner, or child can take a physical and economic toll on the caregiver, causing caregiver burden. Caregiver burden is a multidimensional response to physical, psychological, emotional, social, and financial stressors associated with the caregiving experience. Caregivers who experience burden are more likely to have a higher risk of depression and a lower quality of life. Early recognition of caregiver burden is important in determining appropriate interventions.",

      "abstract": "Parenting style has a very important role in preventing violence against children. Domestic violence is very close to children's lives. Violence that is often carried out in the household will affect children. Children who live in families who experience domestic violence have a higher risk of experiencing neglect, becoming victims of direct abuse and also have the risk of losing parents. There are four forms of domestic violence that are often perpetrated by parents against children, namely: physical violence, psychological violence, sexual violence and household neglect. This parenting style has a major impact on the moral ethics of children. Incorrect choice of parenting style can actually have several impacts on children, such as not being able to make decisions, not being good at building social relationships, disrupting physical development, having unstable emotions, and being more likely to disobey parents. Abstrak Pola asuh mempunyai peran yang sangat penting dalam tindakan pencegahan kekerasan terhadap anak. Kekerasan dalam rumah tangga sangatlah dekat dengan kehidupan anak, Kekerasan yang sering di lakukan didalam rumah tangga akan berpengaruh pada anak-anak. Anak-anak yang tinggal dalam lingkup keluarga yang mengalami kekerasan dalam rumah tangga memiliki risiko yang lebih tinggi untuk mengalami penelantaran, menjadi korban penganiayaan langsung dan juga memiliki resiko untuk kehilangan orang tua. Bentuk kekerasan dalam rumah tangga yang sering di lakukan orang tua terhadap anak ada empat bentuk kekerasan yaitu: kekerasan fisik, kekerasan psikis, kekerasan seksual dan penelantaran rumah tangga. Pola asuh tersebut berdampak besar pada etika moral anak. Salah pemilihan pola asuh nyatanya dapat membuat beberapa dampak pada anak, seperti tidak dapat membuat keputusan, kurang pintar dalam membangun hubungan sosial, gangguan pada perkembangan fisik, memiliki emosi yang kurang stabil, hingga lebih sering membangkang pada orangtua.",

      "title": "Filial Obligation, Kant’s Duty of Beneficence, and Need",
      "abstract": "Do adult children have a particular duty, or set of duties, to their aging parents? What might the normative source and content of filial obligation be? This chapter examines Kant's duty of beneficence in The Doctrine of Virtue and the Groundwork, suggesting that at its core, performance of filial duty occurs in response to the needs of aging parents. The duty of beneficence accounts for inevitable vulnerabilities that befall human rational beings and reveals moral agents as situated in communities of dependence and mutual aid. Other accounts of filial obligation, such as those based on a notion of gratitude, virtue, or friendship, generate various difficulties and fail to adequately address and emphasize four morally significant features of the adult child/ aging parent relationship. First, the relationship between adult children and their aging parents is one of dependency created by the increasing frailty and need of those parents. Second, the obligations that adult children have to aging parents take place in the context of a relationship not voluntarily assumed, but not coerced. Third, given a cultural tendency toward paternalistic care of elderly individuals, the content of filial obligation should safeguard against such treatment. Fourth, because dependency relations between adult children and aging parents can involve an immense degree of sacrifice on the part of the caretaker, an acknowledgment of duties should be accompanied by a concurrent acknowledgment of the necessary limitation of duties. Addressing these four issues is essential in offering a coherent account of the normative source, content, nature, and scope of adult children's duty to care for their aging parents. This essay demonstrates that the Kantian duty of beneficence, when functioning as the philosophical foundation of filial obligation, allows for ample light to be shed upon and for proper analysis to take place of these fourissues.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to traditional practice, today juvenile courts and child welfare agencies attempt to identify and involve children's fathers in cases as soon as possible. This changing approach to nonresident fathers, in turn, makes child protection cases more complicated. If poorly implemented, it can also threaten to undermine the goals of modern child protection law-insuring children's safety, reuniting children with the parents from whom they were removed when possible, and moving them rapidly into alternate permanent homes when not possible. Most obviously, if the policy of involving nonresidential fathers is implemented woodenly, by requiring that children be placed with the fathers at the outset of the case when little is known about them, the children may be endangered. Less dramatically, efforts to work with fathers can result in children remaining in the system longer. And working with fathers can undermine, or even short-circuit, efforts to reunite children with the mothers from whom they were taken, raising problems of defining children's best interests as well as fairness to both parents in what amounts to state-generated custody contests. This article describes the changing practices and the reasons for them, explores the problems that may be created, and proposes solutions.",

This inevitably runs the risk of what is repressed returning to break into the way the family actually functions, undermining the way it works when the other fails to satisfy an excessive demand for personal reassurance. The frustrated spouse will then be tempted to seek support in their personal realisation from the child. Within such a context of social advancement of an exacerbated form of emotional individualism, resorting to a third party to redress matters sometimes proves to be essential as a way of getting out of the spiral leading to ultra-modern solitude – that of the neoliberalism of sentiments.",

The \"guilt\" of the parents is often transformed to the feeling of guilt of the children in the sense of a traumatic feeling of guilt. This happens especially when sufficient mourning is not possible. Feelings of guilt by reason of the mere existence of the child (basic feelings of guilt) and the oedipal and other feelings of guilt out of rivalry can be reinforced (feelings of guilt out of vitality). Strivings for separation may be connected with guilt by the children (feelings of guilt regarding separation). The recognition of the adults' responsibility (especially choice of partners, functionalization of the child to facilitate the separation from the own parents, to maintain the image of an intact family or the struggle for power at the cost of the children) diminishes the feelings of guilt of the children.",

The current study examines longitudinal associations between purpose in life and mastery in a sample of Canadian youth (N = 662) ages 18 to 29 across three biennial waves of data. Purpose in life and mastery were reciprocally associated within and across time, suggesting that these assets develop in tandem. However, emotional support from friends and romantic partners also moderated the associations. Specifically, the reciprocal association were significant for youth with high levels of friend and romantic partner support, but not for youth with low levels of support. Father and mother emotional support did not moderate the pathways. Findings highlight the importance of peer and romantic partner emotional support in cultivating youth’s sense of purpose in life and mastery during the transition to young adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Dibandingkan anak yang menjadi korban tindak kekerasan, anak korban penelantaran sering kali kurang memperoleh perhatian publik secara serius karena penderitaan yang dialami korban dianggap tidak sedramatis sebagaimana layaknya anak-anak yang teraniaya secara fisik. Penelantaran anak merupakan bagian dari bentuk kekerasan terhadap anak, karena ia termasuk dalam kekerasan anak secara sosial (social abuse), kekerasan terhadap anak seringkali diidentikkan dengan kekerasan kasat mata, seperti kekerasan fisikal dan seksual. Padahal kekerasan yang bersifat psikis dan sosial (struktural) juga membawa dampak buruk dan permanen terhadap anak. Istilah (child abuse) atau perlakuan salah terhadap anak bisa terentang mulai yang bersifat fisik (physical abuse) hingga seksual (sexual abuse), dari yang bermatra psikis (mental buse) hingga sosial (social abuse) yang berdimensi kekerasan struktural. Seorang anak dikatakan terlantar bukan karena ia sudah tidak memiliki salah satu orangtua atau keduanya. Anak terlantar adalah anak-anak yang karena suatu sebab tidak terpenuhi kebutuhan dasarnya dengan wajar, baik rohani, jasmani, maupun sosial. Terlantar disini juga dalam pengertian ketika hak-hak anak untuk tumbuh-kembang secara wajar, hak anak untuk memperoleh pendidikan yang layak, dan hak untuk memperoleh pelayanan kesehatan yang memadai tidak terpenuhi karena kelalaian, ketidak mengertian orangtua, karena ketidak mampuan, atau karena kesengajaan. Dengan lahirnya UU No 23 Tahun 2002 tentang Perlindungan Anak yang disetujui DPR RI Tanggal 23 September 2002, maka perlindungan anak telah memiliki landasan hukumnya secara yuridis. Pokok bahasan pada penulisan ini adalah: bagaimana pandangan serta sanksi pidana terhadap pelaku penelantaran anak, menurut hukum Islam dan UU No 23 Tahun 2002 tentang Perlindungan Anak?. Yang pada pembahasanya menggunakan analisis perbandingan. Dari pembahasan yang telah penulis lakukan, dapat diambil kesimpulan bahwa: 1). Hukum Islam memandang tindakan penelantaran anak sebagai tindakan yang tidak dibenarkan dalam Islam, serta dikategorikan sebagai tindak pidana yang berakibat dapat dipidana dengan sanksi hukum. Berdasarkan pada hukum ta'zir. Yang ketentuan putusan hukumannya diserahkan kepada kebijaksanaan pihak penguasa atau hakim. 2). UU No 23 Tahun 2002 tentang Perlindungan Anak memandang tindakan penelantaran anak sebagai tindakan pelanggaran hukum yang berakibat dapat dipidana dengan sanksi hukum sebagaimana diatur dalam UU No 23 Tahun 2002 tentang Perlindungan Anak. 3). Dari segi perlindungan hak-hak anak, hukum Islam relatif lebih lengkap. Demikianlah kiranya abstraksi keseluruhan dari pembahasan yang penulis lakukan dalam penyusunan penulisan skripsi ini.",

E., et.all, 2008).Unlike other agents, such as family and school, peer groups allow children to escape the direct supervision of adults (Macionis, et.all, 2010).Although there are various positive attitude of peer group such as serve as a source of information, teach gender role, teach unity and collective value in life, serve as a practicing venue in adulthood, identity formation etc., there are also various negative attitude which are Peer pressure, risk behavior, aggression and pro-social behavior, sexual promiscuity (Dumas, T. D., 2012).Some time it is seem that children are victimized by their peer in absence of supervision of their guardian.Much of the aggression in schools, especially during adolescence, involves individuals \"bullying\" their peers (Boulton, et.all, 1999).When children and adolescents want to express anger and contempt toward peers, they sometimes aggress physically and also hurt others by friendship manipulation, social exclusion, and negative gossip or back stabbing (Crick, et.all, 1996).It has been estimated that 10% to 30% of children, during a given school can be identified as victims on the basis of severity, frequency, or salience of their peer victimization experiences (Kochenderfer & Ladd, 1996).In contrast to earlier beliefs that boys were more likely to be victims of peer aggression than girls, investigators now tend to agree that boys and girls are equally likely to be victimized.Some studies show that boys tend to report more physical victimization whereas girls are more likely to be either verbally victimized or excluded from their peer groups (Paquette, J. A. & Underwood, M. K., 1999).On the other hand, the physical form of Abstract:The main intent of the study is to describe the forms of peer victimizations, response towards victimizations, and its impact on victims.In recent age, the concept of 'peer victimization' is crucial and debatable issue in social science academic field as well as popular in media issues.The study used descriptive research design and was conducted by quantitative survey method.Data were collected from a diverse sample of 203 students from six to ten grade, who have been randomly selected by using random digit method.Bivariate analysis has been used to find association and to test hypothesis by using chi square.The findings show that verbal victimization is the most common type of peer victimization, where 'Name Calling', 'Pushing' and 'Social Exclusion' were determined as the most common forms of verbal, physical and social peer victimization respectively.Moreover, Cross-tabulation represent various relation between gender and friends' role, long-term effect, and number of friends.Furthermore, Cross tabulation shows that boys are more victim of physical victimization than girls and who have more friends they have less probability of victimizations.Additionally, the results also show that boys are being revengeful after victimization, in contrast girls have trust issues as immediate response.",

На фоне широкого разнообразия исследований, посвящённых данной проблематике, встречаются лишь единичные работы, затрагивающие инвалидность, и практически отсутствуют попытки оценить установки, мотивы и практики активного долголетия среди лиц с инвалидностью. Цель настоящего исследования — определить, существуют ли значимые отличия в установках, мотивах, практиках активного долголетия у лиц с инвалидностью и без неё. На основании данных репрезентативного социологического исследования установлено, что в целом среди инвалидов ниже субъективная оценка желаемой продолжительности жизни, а среди барьеров её достижения на первый план выходит неудовлетворительное состояние здоровья. В то же время, наличие инвалидности не влияет на оценку семейных отношений как основного источника мотивов долголетия. Показано, что более выраженная удовлетворённость семейными отношениями сопутствует более высоким установкам на продолжительность жизни. Однако на практике инвалиды в среднем реже общаются со своими родными, чем респонденты без инвалидности, что формирует риск одиночества и сопутствующего снижения установок на долголетие. Подтверждено, что инвалидность сопряжена с менее выраженными практиками заботы о здоровье, более низкой социальной активностью. Показано, что в отдельных аспектах слабая вовлечённость инвалидов в практики активного долголетия может быть обусловлена отсутствием или недостаточной представленностью доступной среды. В заключительной части работы перечислены общие рекомендации, касающиеся повышения возможностей достижения активного долголетия людьми с инвалидностью.",

Potential modifiers of separation/divorce include youth's age at separation, custodial parent's remarriage, nonresidential parent's frequency of contact, parent-child relationships, and parental psychopathology.The relatively small impact of separation/divorce was further diminished after accounting for parental psychopathology. An interaction of separation/divorce and the father-child relationship emerged.The dramatic increase in youth suicide during the past three decades seems unlikely to be attributable to the increase in divorce rates.",

      "title": "Mentoring as an individual form of preparing orphans for independent living in Ukraine",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The purpose of the study is to analyze and define the content, specifics, and procedures of social and psychological work with citizens who have expressed a desire to become mentors for orphans. Introduction: In Ukraine, there are more than 750 foundations of institutional care and upbringing of children, in which approximately 106,000 children live. Only 8% among them have the status of orphans and children deprived of parental care; the other 92% have parents, but due to some difficult life circumstances of parents or presence of special needs or disability in children, they cannot live or be brought up in the family. It means that 92% of children without the status of orphans or children deprived of parental care cannot be adopted or placed for living and upbringing to other forms of family placement (guardianship/care, foster family, family-type orphanage). Along with this, out of 8% of orphan children and children deprived of parental care, there are no opportunities to be accommodated in any family forms of upbringing the following children: teenagers and youngsters, brothers and sisters from families with many children, and children with disabilities. In such children, close emotional relationships with meaningful, constant adults, which is a vital necessity for their psycho-emotional development and well-being, have been lost or were not formed at all. Accordingly, the introduction of mentoring for orphans and children deprived of parental care who live in relevant institutions is motivated by the necessity to satisfy the need of every child in emotional support, assistance and protection by a significant, authoritative person, and friend. Methods: The study uses an experience which was gained during the realization of the project as the author-developer of the methodology of socio-psychological work with citizens and children concerning preparations for mentoring and training for both coordinators and mentors of the Mentoring Program in cooperation with specialists of the “One Hope” non-governmental organization; in the role of educator for the preparation of coordinators for the Mentoring Program implementation, as well as in the role of expert during the implementation of Mentoring Program by the community organization “One Hope” during the 2009-2016 period [1]. Also, authors participated in developing of the mentors preparing program over orphans and children deprived of parental care in order to receive approval at the state level. Results: Mentoring for orphans and children deprived of parental care residing in institutions has been implemented in Ukraine since 2009 by the “One Hope” (“Odna Nadia”) public organization in cooperation with the Kyiv City Children’s Service and the Kyiv City Center of Social Services for Families, Children and Young People. The project “One Hope” was launched in the city of Kyiv and the Kyiv region during 2009-2016. Since 2016, mentoring as an individual form of support and assistance for a child living in a residential institution has been introduced in Ukraine at the state level. Conclusions: If an orphan child or a child deprived of parental care is unable to live and being brought up in a family, then the mentor’s role in the life of this child is of paramount importance. This is due to the fact that such a form of individual support through mentoring will facilitate the preparation of every orphan child for independent living in the future.",

In addition to facing these changes and their impacts, adults must also take on challenges in terms of self-concept, body image, life goals, and life meaning. Illnesses that commonly occur during this life stage include menopausal depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. Traditional treatment models are medical-oriented, but curative effects are limited and hospital visits still occur at high frequencies, resulting in increased medical expenses and disruptions in family life. The authors review the current literature on curative models in this area, and discuss the potential of a combination of physical therapy, cognitive, and existential-humanistic therapy to improve patients' physical strength, self-concept, self-esteem, and self-confidence in an effort to overcome physio-psycho-social disorders and to increase vitality.",

The partner of the spouse abuser tries various unsuccessful strategies to appease her spouse in order to change his behavior. If the relationship lasts for years, she adapts by developing a milder but parallel dissociative process, developing chains of state-dependent memory and resultant ego states for the different phases of the domestic abuse cycle. The children suffer from attachment disruption which can potentially continue the process to the next generation.",

      "title": "Income Supports across the Life Course",
      "abstract": "Public debate about relations between generations is out of tune with family behavior. Although the public argument is about whether older people get too large a share, as a private matter they voluntarily give more to their children than the other way around. Family sharing is wanted and is well accepted over the life course. Similarly, although there is much talk about the isolation and abandonment of aged parents by their children, the proportion of families caring for an aged relative or friend (nearly one in four in I998) rises steadily. The proportion of aged people who are caring for a grandchild also rises steadily (Minkler, I998; Rimer, I998). Since the public view differs from private behavior, in approaching a discussion of principles for income support across the life course, it is useful to begin by outlining actual family patterns. In modern times, a critical problem of aging lies in feelings about losing command over one's self and surroundings. The issue has to do with changes in bodily functioning and with power once exercised in relation to family, friends, and work. Some changes are inevitable, but modern American practices may enforce abrupt transitions. Yesterday, one worked; today one draws a pension (Quinn, Burkhauser, and Myers, I992). Yesterday, others needed something from an aged person. Today she disposes of no product and she may worry whether savings will disqualify her for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid. The day-to-day arrangements between old people and their families are a complex blend of economic exchange and services; it may not be clear who is the net beneficiary. In early colonial practice, men used carefully crafted documents with legal force to turn over the farm or business to their heirs in exchange for lifetime care for their wives and themselves (Greven, I970; Demos, I978). The practice lives on in widespread, contemporary understanding that a child giving care inherits a preferred portion of an estate. Thus, sentiment and responsibility have a large role in family relationships, and they interact with true power in the disposition of money and property. These arrangements play out with respect to decisions by older and younger people about whether to live independently or to share a dwelling. It can be demonstrated that Social Security has led retired parents to live separately from their adult children-a trend that continued as Social Security matured. In I952, some 33 percent of the aged lived with adult children, in I968, only 20 percent did so (Schorr, I96I, I98o). In I989, fewer than I3 percent and in I994, fewer than Iz percent lived with adult children (U.S. Bureau of the Census, I990, I994). In short, families choose separate living, and assured income makes it feasible. While it would be wrong to say, or at any rate it has not been established, that living together is generally destructive of relations between generations, it does appear that extended families prefer not to live together. Those that do live together are predominantly families with low incomes. Why? Children with good incomes tend to have parents with good incomes, and so they can live separately, as they wish. Those with low incomes live together as a way of helping; who helps whom more is not always clear or important. In any event, Americans at any income level do not make regular cash contributions to parents. We visit, we call, we give moral support, we care for, we pay some bills-and we live together only if we must. The need for generations to share dwellings is exacerbated by the relative disadvantage of young people in recent decades. The income of young adults has fallen even as prices for housing were rising. Unable to purchase homes but saving for a down payment, some young adults delay leaving the family home, and some return to it (U.S. Bureau of the Census, I996; Finnegan, 1998a, Igg8b.) Welfare reform undoubtedly adds to the problem. …",

La escuela, desde su encargo social, debe desarrollar acciones que contribuyan a la prevención del maltrato infantil en todas sus manifestaciones con acciones participativas que conlleven a erradicar todo acto que atente contra el bienestar de la infancia con un enfoque preventivo y desarrollador. Se aporta en este trabajo una estrategia educativa dirigida a familias de niños con discapacidad, elaborada a partir del diagnóstico realizado y en correspondencia con las necesidades identificadas en los familiares con los que se trabajó. Se realizó una investigación de campo, en la que se utilizaron métodos como la observación y la encuestas. La medición de las variables se llevó a cabo a través de un cuestionario estandarizado, el cual fue sometido inicialmente a los análisis de validez y confiabilidad. La información recogida se vertió en una base de datos creada en software de procesamiento estadístico SPSS 26.0.",

      "abstract": "This study addresses three questions: Does earlier family mobility have long-term effects on later parent-adult offspring relations? Do differences in parenting behaviors and family social capital account for these effects? Does the family structure in which a move occurs matter? The author investigates these issues using 17-year longitudinal data from two generations. The results suggest that frequency of family mobility has no effects on parent-adult child relations. Instead, it appears that age at mobility matters most. Adult sons who moved during adolescence and during both childhood and adolescence have poorer relationships with their mothers and fathers. Earlier mobility, though, generally has no associations with an adult daughter’s relationship with her parents. For sons and daughters, moves that occur in divorced households are the most difficult on later parent-adult child relations. Some, but not all, of the long-term effects of family mobility are because of differences in parenting between movers and nonmovers.",

This chapter highlights events perceived as the most important ones in the lives of centenarians. Domain-specific events are also considered in this chapter, including health events, family events, and work events. Finally, the impact of life events on the overall well-being of the oldest-old adults is considered. The evidence suggests that positive cumulative (\"lifetime\") events reduce levels of negative affect, whereas cumulative (\"lifetime\") negative events promote negative affect. When proximal events (i.e., those experienced in the past 20 years) and distal events (i.e., those experienced more than 20 years ago) are considered, proximal events are more likely to reduce levels of positive affect and enhance levels of negative affect. Distal events, on the other hand, are more likely to enhance overall feelings of positive affect.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes the results of a sociological study conducted in 2018 in the villages and small towns of Bashkortostan. 200 married couples were interviewed in two categories: shift migrants families and the control group (not involved in temporary employment). Temporary employment is considered to be a condition for the inclusion of the modern family in translocal migration processes. The study allowed us to draw the following conclusions. In the conditions of regular long-term absence of the spouse, stable translocal connections of the migrant with the family are formed in the families of shift migrants. Almost all shift migrants seek to compensate for their physical absence by regular communication with their spouse and children; by discussing topical issues of the family’s economic and social life. Gender attitudes and behavior of shift migrants and their spouses in the sphere of intra-family relations are characterized by a significant gap between ideas about the ideal, correct type of intra-family relations (which is mainly egalitarian), and real behavior in everyday life (which in its content is traditional and gender-marked). At the same time, in families of shift migrants, traditional gender stereotypes and norms of behavior are declared and produced to a much lesser extent than in the control group of families, both in the distribution of household responsibilities and in matters of leadership in the family. The consequences of temporary labor migration for families of shift migrants are not clear. Along with the obvious positive effects that are manifested in the economic life of the family, there are a number of difficulties in managing the economy, life in rural areas, raising children, and physical and socio-psychological well-being.",

Adopting a purely qualitative method of analysis, we show instances of family dinnertime conversations in which children appeared banned from participation, while they are the topic of the ongoing talk. We have called \" backstage interaction, \" sequences adjacent to those in which the child is involved, and within her/his auditory range, so that the child projected participation role alternates between that of addressee and overhearer. We argue that the \"backstage talk\" in the child's presence has the main effect of casting the current interaction with the child as a representation, in Goffman's terms (1959). Though, the child is left the opportunity to enter again the conversation: the person involved is interested in layering the selfs/he exposed, offering the child a \"fictional self to interact with, thus preserving their face from the incumbent threat of the child's impoliteness or embarrassing \"spontaneity\".",

      "abstract": "&lt;p style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective. &lt;/strong&gt;Identification of meaningful features of the ratio of adolescents' self-esteem of status among classmates and stylistic aspects of interactions with parents among students from full and incomplete families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background. &lt;/strong&gt;Family and school are the most important institutions of a teenager's socialization. In the course of the social relationships developing here, value orientations are formed, norms of social role behavior are mastered, fundamental changes related to the development of personality occur. It is clear that, from a socio-psychological point of view, a teenager's involvement in these institutions does not exist in isolation; meaningful life contexts intersect, often acquiring a conflict character. In connection with the general trend of increasing single-parent families, a comparative study of indicators characterizing the features of socialization of adolescents from full and single-parent families is of particular relevance for the organization of the educational process among primary and high school students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study design. &lt;/strong&gt;The paper studied the opinions of adolescents with different self-assessment of their status in the classroom (\"leaders\" and \"outcasts\") regarding a number of indicators that characterize the stylistic features of their interaction with parents: \"significant other\" in the immediate environment; parents' acceptance of the personal position (\"opinions\") of a teenager; forms of punishment of parents and reaction to them a teenager. A comparison of the stylistic features of the relationship between students and parents in full and single-parent families is carried out, depending on the self-assessment of the status (\"leader\" or \"outcast\") among classmates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participants. &lt;/strong&gt;40575 students in grades 7-11 from 17 regions of the Russian Federation. Subsamples: from full families &amp;ndash; 73,7%; from incomplete families &amp;ndash; 26,3%; in a full family: \"leaders\" in the class &amp;ndash; 7,0%, \"outcasts\" in the class &amp;ndash; 4,7%; in a single-parent family, respectively: 6,5% and 5,8%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurements. &lt;/strong&gt;Anonymous survey using an author's questionnaire containing closed questions. The processing of the research materials was carried out using the statistical software package SPSS 21 and StatSoft Statistica 7.0. To compare the proportions observed in two independent samples and expressed as percentages, the chi-square criterion was used in the module \"Basic statistics &amp;ndash; Difference tests\" of the StatSoft Statistica 7.0 package. Factor analysis using the method of selecting the Main components with rotation according to the criterion Kaiser's Verimax.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results. &lt;/strong&gt;The analysis of the characteristics of the frequency of distribution of students' responses regarding various aspects of their relationship with parents showed that such social parameters as completeness/incompleteness of the family in which the teenager is brought up and his self-assessment of status among classmates differentiate the opinion of schoolchildren about the stylistic features of child-parent relations. The results of the factor analysis allowed us to identify four factors that characterize the peculiarity of the relationships between different aspects of the relationship of adolescents with their parents: \"authoritarianism &amp;mdash; democracy\"; \"upholding independence in relations with parents\"; \"seeking consent &amp;mdash; limiting the child's social contacts\"; \"striving to defend their position &amp;mdash; prohibition of interpersonal contacts with friends\". The interrelation of the features of the socio-psychological interaction of a teenager with his parents and his well-being in the class team is revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt; The results obtained indicate a kind of mutual projection of the socio-psychological relationships of a teenager with his parents and his interactions with classmates. In this regard, school educational programs should take into account the types of child-parent relationships that develop in full and incomplete families. The problem of the socio-psychological well-being of a teenager requires coordination of the efforts of the family and the school, taking into account the age-specific features of development.&lt;/p&gt;",

Se presenta el caso de R.S.M., paciente masculino de 73 años con dependencia total desde abril de 2024, cuya historia clínica revela múltiples patologías y problemas de adherencia al tratamiento. Desarrollo: Su situación impacta significativamente a su familia, especialmente a su hija quien asume el rol de cuidadora principal. Desde el punto de vista de la estructura familiar de Mc-Goldrick, R.S.M. vive en una familia extensa, en la cual las relaciones interpersonales del núcleo no son estresantes ni tensas. Posee importantes redes de apoyo y colaboración. Destacan dentro de los factores protectores la buena relación familiar, sin embargo, dentro de los factores de riesgo se observan las múltiples condiciones médicas de algunos miembros de la familia, además de la dependencia severa de R.S.M. que puede causar estrés en los cuidadores. También se evaluó el ambiente físico, donde se destaca la calidad de la vivienda y del entorno barrial. Discusión: Se identificaron los problemas principales como el deterioro de la movilidad del paciente, la sobrecarga de su cuidador y la sintomatología depresiva de la cónyuge, por lo que desde el punto de vista de las intervenciones de enfermería se destaca la importancia de las intervenciones psicosociales en usuarios con dependencia severa.",

For those children who do not return to their parents and cannot find permanent homes with other family members, adoption is the favored outcome. This review examines the composite measure in the federal Child and Family Services Review that measures agency performance related to the timeliness of adoptions of foster children. It summarizes the multiple factors that research has found to be associated with increased risk for adoption delay and disruption. These include child characteristics, family of origin and adoptive family characteristics, and features of child welfare services and systems. Practices that have been broadly linked to adoption timeliness or address risk factors associated with delays in adoption are described, including social worker activities and agency or system-wide practice.",

      "abstract": "Los programas de Atencion Temprana cada vez mas tienen en cuenta atender a la familia del nino con trastorno del desarrollo. La familia y el entorno familiar y tambien social del nino tienen un papel muy activo y determinante en la interaccion social que provocara el desarrollo madurativo del cerebro del nino. Desde la Atencion Temprana se evalua a la familia, se le da asesoramiento e informacion sobre lo relacionado con el trastorno del hijo, se interviene sobre sus dificultades o se promueven grupos de ayuda o redes de apoyo social. Es importante atender la adaptacion de la familia y sus miembros a la situacion que se produce en el momento del diagnostico del trastorno y en el desarrollo posterior de una posible discapacidad. El diagnostico de un trastorno del desarrollo en un nino –el cual puede derivar en una discapacidad- es un evento que produce un gran impacto emocional en los padres. Ese impacto puede suponer un trauma acompanado de estres y dificultades para adaptarse a la nueva situacion, asi como un funcionamiento alterado en las familias Tradicionalmente la atencion a la familia en este campo se ha centrado en atencion y correccion de las dificultades y los deficits y no tanto en promover sus capacidades, recursos o potencialidades. Este trabajo parte de una vision positiva de la familia del nino con trastorno del desarrollo, centrada en las potencialidades de la familia y en su papel activo en la adaptacion a situacion que viven. Y persigue profundizar en la resiliencia como una cualidad basica de readaptacion contemplada por la psicologia positiva y a la resiliencia familiar como base del cambio en la familia desde una optica sistemica. La resiliencia es una capacidad positiva de afrontar y adaptarse exitosamente a esa situacion traumatica, que se puede promover y desarrollar para mejorar la adaptacion familiar al trastorno y favorecer el desarrollo del nino. Ademas, esa capacidad resiliente esta modulada tanto por caracteristicas y factores del individuo como por factores del entorno familiar y social. Por su parte, los trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) suponen un impacto emocional en los padres que se traduce en un alto grado de estres y dificultades de adaptacion. Nuestra investigacion tiene como objetivo conocer el impacto que supone el diagnostico de TEA sobre la resiliencia, el papel de la resiliencia en la adaptacion de los padres y su relacion con factores individuales, sociales y familiares que son trascendentes tanto en el desarrollo de la resiliencia como en la adaptacion exitosa al trastorno del desarrollo. A su vez, nos planteamos validar la Escala de Resiliencia (RS) en poblacion espanola. Para ello evaluamos la resiliencia con la escala RS en un grupo de 128 padres de ninos con y sin TEA, junto con otras variables que identifican a factores protectores y a variables resultado de adaptacion. Los resultados muestran la importancia de los factores protectores familiares y sociales en la prediccion de la adaptacion al TEA pero no avalan el papel de la resiliencia en la misma ni la modulacion de la resiliencia por parte de los factores protectores. Se discute la validez de la escala RS para medir el actual constructo de resiliencia, concluyendo que esta medida individual de resiliencia no responde adecuadamente a la compleja realidad del constructo resiliencia, y que se deben desarrollar nuevos instrumentos de evaluacion que engloben los factores del entorno del sujeto. Early childhood Intervention programs ever more take into account care of the family of a child with developmental disorder. Child’s family and social environment also have a very active and influential role in social interaction that will cause the maturation of the child’s brain. From Early Intervention, family is evaluated, advice and information on matters related to the child’s disorder is given, their difficulties are treated and self-help groups or social support networks are promoted. Address the adaptation of the family and its members to the situation that occurs at the time of diagnosis of the disorder is important. The diagnosis of a developmental disorder in a child-which can lead to a disability- is an event which causes a great emotional impact on parents. That impact can be a trauma accompanied by stress and difficulty to adaptation and malfunction in families. Historically, the family care in this field has focused on attention and correction of problems and handicaps rather than promoting their capabilities, resources and potentialities. This work is based on a positive view of the family of a child with developmental disorder, focused on its potentialities and its active role in adaptation. And it pursues to deepen about resilience as a basic quality of readjustment provided by Positive Psychology and family resilience as a basis for change in the family from a systemic perspective. Resilience is a positive ability for cope and adapt successfully with this traumatic situation. It can be promoted and developed in order to improve family adaptation to the disorder and thus encourage child development. Furthermore, the resilient capacity is modulated by both individual characteristics and factors such as family and social environmental factors. The evaluation of resilience has not taken the complexity that the concept hides and development of psychometric instruments has been limited to the individual characteristics and to consider only individual personality features or individual protective factors rather than the whole person with his environment and his adaption processes to the traumatic situation. Meanwhile, the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) involves an emotional impact on parents with a high degree of stress and adjustment difficulties. Our research aims to determine the role of resilience in parents’ adaptation and its relationship with personal, social and family factors that are important in development of resilience and successful adaptation to the developmental disorder. In turn, we plan to validate the Resilience Scale (RS). We evaluate resilience with the RS scale in a group of 128 parents of children with and without ASD, along with other variables that identify protective factors and outcomes of adaptation. Results show the importance of family and social protective factors in predicting adaptation to ASD but do not support the role of resilience or the modulation of resilience by protective factors. The validity of the RS scale to measure the current construct of resilience is discussed, concluding that this individual measure of resilience does not respond adequately to the complex reality of resilience construct, and new evaluation tools that encompass the factors of the subject's environment should be developed.",

      "title": "Doing Family Right : The impact of children’s institutions on family-practices, parental norms and social distinctions.",
      "abstract": "Over the last century, children’s lives have become still more institutionalized in most European countries. Though the organizational structure differs, day-cares and schools have been entrusted with the task of moulding children into proper social beings and educated citizens. This endeavour has increasingly come to include parents, as they are required to organize family-life in ways that support the institutional work and raise their children to be ‘educationable’ and fit for institutional life. Thus, child institutions have a standardizing impact on family-practices as well as on notions of child-rearing and parenthood. However, institutional norms also have differentiating effects. Whenever the norms conflict with specific parents’ conditions, values or upbringing practices, professionals will problematize the behaviour in ways that might emphasise cultural, social, or ethnic differences. Also, other parents might distance themselves from what they see as inappropriate behaviour, often associated with certain positions of social class and ethnicity. In this way, parenting practices have become markers of distinction, reflecting the moral standards set and authorized by child-institutions. This chapter reflects on these standardizing and differentiating processes and the implications they have on family life and norms of child-rearing, yet also – in a wider perspective - for the production of social divisions in society.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY This article describes some of the findings of a study undertaken to evaluate all foster and adoptive placements in one local authority social work department in Scotland. The num bers, characteristics and care experiences of children in foster and adoptive care were con sidered. The study found that for the majority of children placement in foster care led to separation from siblings. The children were most vulnerable to separation at points of entry and leaving care. Separation from brothers and sisters can have lifelong consequences for the child and his or her siblings, as few of the children were found to have plans which included reunification with their siblings. A fragmented picture emerged concerning sib lings' living situations. Children were found to have siblings living in a variety of situations, both in and outwith the care system. Social workers lacked full information about the family composition where contact with parents was lost or siblings had moved from the area. Chil dren were most likely to be placed with siblings in temporary and relative foster place ments. One of the primary concerns in child care practice has been the mainten ance of children's relationships with their parents. Less attention has been paid to the maintenance of relationships between brothers and sisters, despite an increasing recognition of the short-term and long term importance of sibling relationships for children in care or accommodation. Although it is generally accepted as good practice to place sibling groups together, the placement of a child in care or accommodation only too often leads to separation from siblings.

      "title": "How mothers shape the context of their preschool children’s play: a grounded theory",
      "abstract": "Play is an integral part of preschool children’s lives. Widespread concerns that children have less free, child-led play than in previous generations permeate the general public and academia, with parents criticised for: 1. limiting children’s play opportunities by being overprotective; 2. not prioritising play with their children; and 3. choosing structured, enrichment activities rather than free play for their children. Preschool children’s play is highly contextualised, yet how opportunities for play are created in the everyday context of family life has received limited attention. Mothers are often the primary caregivers and major decision makers regarding opportunities their children have for play. However, policy makers, educators, and health professionals have arguably neglected mothers’ experiences underpinning these decisions. The foundations underlying these criticisms cannot be understood without asking: 1. How do mothers describe, experience and participate in their preschool children’s play? 2. What influences mothers’ actions to create or limit opportunities for their preschool children’s play? To answer these questions meaningfully, I took an ecological perspective using a constructivist grounded theory methodology. From 24 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with ten tertiary-educated, middle class mothers of preschool children (children aged three to five years who had not commenced formal schooling), I developed a grounded theory of How mothers shape the context of their preschool children’s play. Using photo elicitation, eight mothers also shared photos of their children’s play in the interviews. The theory explores the process by which the mothers constructed their actions in relation to their preschool children’s play. These actions were based on a foundation of mothers’ guiding motivations that were moderated through their perceptions of their child, their child’s play and the context. By diagramming and grouping mothers’ actions on two intersecting axes in terms of both the degree to which they facilitated or restricted play as well as their level of interaction with their child, I created a parental actions diagram of four quadrants: stopping, sharing, cultivating and limiting play. I explored the dynamic and iterative nature of mothers’ actions by plotting sequential actions as a series of points on the diagram. The patterns of linkages between actions, namely weighing up competing priorities, trumping priorities, creating win-win opportunities and opening up possibilities, revealed how and why mothers facilitated or restricted their children’s play. I found that mothers experienced and valued acting in a broader variety of ways towards their children’s play than either popular preconceptions or the parent-child play literature suggests. The theory explicated the process of how mothers addressed the challenges of: 1. keeping their children safe during play without being overprotective; 2. engaging meaningfully with their children through play, without being limited to direct play; and 3. fostering the developmental needs of their children, without over-engineering children’s activities. Through the sharing actions of incorporating play in everyday activities and peripherally supervising their children’s play in particular, mothers in the study created opportunities for their preschool children to play. These actions are typically associated with parents from developing societies, challenging the assumption that middle class parent-child play is characterised by direct play with children, a sharing action I labeled as co-playing. This constructivist theory provides novel insights into the process of how mothers shape the context of their preschool children’s play and a new, data-driven understanding for families, policy makers, health professionals and educators seeking to facilitate preschool children’s opportunities for play. Mothers are provided with insights into the multitude of ways that they facilitate their children’s play while balancing their other commitments.

      "abstract": "Abstract Only a minority of adults of all age groups experience difficulty with their finances and affairs, due to the combined effect of their diminished competence and their social circumstances in placing them at risk, from themselves, or from family, friends or others (well-meaning or otherwise). If unable to manage independently or with informal assistance, formal intervention (guardianship) may be required. Neither the traditional formality of courts, nor the tests and clinical processes of medicine are well equipped to judge this in the abstract. Informal (family) models have their place but they (and other options) pose ethical difficulties. A more practical approach is that taken by Australia's multi-disciplinary panels.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Children placed in foster care families usually continue to see their birth parents in supervised and home visits. These children deal with the fact that they belonged to two families in a context where the relationship between the two families is sometimes complex and tense. Based on 45 semi‐structured interviews conducted with foster care families and kinship foster care families, the present study examines the relationship between foster care parents and birth parents in a placement context, and focuses on the factors affecting the nature and quality of this relationship. The results showed that the quality of the relationship dynamics varies according to the following: how well and how often the parent–child visits took place, the birth parents' characteristics, and the foster carers' attitudes. The results also showed that placements in kinship foster care families were more likely to result in conflict and tension between the two parties than placements in regular foster care families.",

      "abstract": "With the growing problem of childhood obesity, recent research has begun to focus on family and social influences on children's eating patterns. Research has demonstrated that children's eating patterns are strongly influenced by characteristics of both the physical and social environment. With regard to the physical environment, children are more likely to eat foods that are available and easily accessible, and they tend to eat greater quantities when larger portions are provided. Additionally, characteristics of the social environment, including various socioeconomic and sociocultural factors such as parents' education, time constraints, and ethnicity influence the types of foods children eat. Mealtime structure is also an important factor related to children's eating patterns. Mealtime structure includes social and physical characteristics of mealtimes including whether families eat together, TV-viewing during meals, and the source of foods (e.g., restaurants, schools). Parents also play a direct role in children's eating patterns through their behaviors, attitudes, and feeding styles. Interventions aimed at improving children's nutrition need to address the variety of social and physical factors that influence children's eating patterns.",

Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that hardship in several domains during childhood and adolescence is associated with feeling relatively older and self-identifying as an adult in the late teens and twenties. Specifically, young people who as adolescents felt unsafe in their schools or neighborhoods, witnessed or were victims of violence, had fewer economic resources in the household, and lived in certain family structures, reported older subjective ages (by one or both measures). We find no evidence that hardship's association with subjective age is mediated by work responsibilities in adolescence or by anticipating a very curtailed life span, but entering adult roles earlier mediates or partially mediates many of these relationships.",

Data collected from personal interviews indicate that older divorced persons are not devastated by their divorce. Although these two groups do not differ in their overall scores of emotional health as measured by the General Well-Being Scale, within certain categories the older persons appear to be emotionally healthier. Statistically significant differences between the two samples include: importance of family closeness; conflict in relationships; and forewarning of the divorce from family members. There are also differences in the familial factors that predict well-being for the two age groups. Professionals intervening at all system levels should be sensitive to age differences and incorporate familial factors that ameliorate postdivorce adjustment. Implications for practice with older divorced persons include strengthening parent/adult child relationships and creatively designing programs at macro and micro levels to decrease family conflict. With younger divorced persons, conflict mediation with the family following divorce is necessary.",

Child characteristics, including the presence of a disability, are one of the influences on sibling relationships. The majority of research has focused on the negative effects of having a sibling with a disability, such as the higher prevalence of emotional issues and/or behavior problems in children who have a sibling with a disability. Siblings of children with disabilities may experience differential parental treatment and parents' resource depletion, and face additional caregiving responsibilities. While negative outcomes have been the focus of much research, more recent research has examined positive outcomes for the families and siblings of children with disabilities. Siblings of children with disabilities tend to be more compassionate and empathetic than children with typically developing siblings, which can lead to closer sibling relationships. They also tend to demonstrate qualities and to develop skills that assist them in their interactions with others as they are more accepting of differences and more aware of those around them.",

      "title": "“Stop going in my room”: A grounded theory study of conflict among stepsiblings",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective This research explores how, and under what conditions, stepsiblings engage in, manage, and resolve conflict. Background Interpersonal conflict is widely recognized as a meaningful and consequential relational dynamic. Although stepfamily conflict has been studied in a variety of family contexts (e.g., spousal, parent–child, stepparent–stepchild), conflict among stepsiblings has received scant attention. The growing prevalence of stepsiblings, coupled with the role of conflict in shaping family dynamics, warrants greater attention be paid to stepsibling conflict. Method Twenty‐five adults were interviewed about their relationships with 71 stepsiblings. Grounded theory procedures were used. Results For conflict between stepsiblings to occur, three conditions had to be in place: (a) opportunity (i.e., shared time, shared space), (b) intimacy (i.e., perceived closeness between stepsiblings or familiarity), and (c) similarity (i.e., age, gender, or role). Sources of conflict included (a) stepsibling behaviors, (b) territory violations (e.g., bedrooms), and (c) differential treatment by stepparents/parents. Conflict management included both intrapersonal and interpersonal strategies. Conclusion Stepsibling conflict should be normalized as an indication of relational closeness, trust, and security. Implications Stepsibling conflicts may help them develop closer bonds. Parents should make space for children, maintain bonds with children, promote stepsibling ties, monitor stepsibling conflicts, and consider children's perspectives.",

New \"big brother\" and \"big sister\" roles are suddenly terminated, often in a catastrophic manner. Young surviving children are sometimes unable to understand the meaning of this event, its impact on the family, and their own role in what has occurred. In this study, 26 families that had sustained the sudden and unexpected death of an infant and that had surviving children were interviewed to obtain data about surviving siblings at least 10 months following the loss. Among the 26 families, there were 35 surviving siblings (ages 16 months to 6 years). The interview schedule sought information relevant to changes in patterns of sleep, toilet training, feeding habits, peer relationships, and parent-child interaction. Among these 35 surviving siblings, parents of 28 siblings (80%) perceived changes in their child's interaction with them, 24 siblings (69%) demonstrated changes in sleep patterns following the baby's death, and 13 siblings (37%) showed changes in social interaction. Regression in toilet training and changes in feeding patterns were infrequent and not areas of major concern for parents. These behavioral changes reflected both a continuum of adjustment by the child and a persistence of parental worries.",

Consequently, this paper found that the spatial composition and care system can partially prescribe the ambits of residents' living and personal interactions as follows:1) Residents' living tends to be completed in each unit, especially when the units are independent.2) The spatial composition inside each unit has an influence on residents' selection of staying places when there are choices other than a place to dine, and at the same time, a commitment of staff and so on take place.3) Residents' interactions naturally do not tend to occur beyond each unit. However, residents' interactions occur widely beyond each unit when adjoining units are connected and also some care beyond physical unit, e.g., joint management, is provided.",

Current social services practices that exacerbate the dilution of family process are hard to eradicate because they are rooted in a culture that promotes the transfer of functions from families to social agencies; families, immersed in the same culture, often collude with the agencies in their own dilution. The treatment of neglect in families calls for the nurturance of the family's process and the disruption of the complementary pattern between family and regulatory agencies.",

El cuidador, ademas de enfrentarse a su propio dolor y a los multiples cambios que supone la enfermedad, tiene que proveer de apoyo emocional y cuidado fisico a la persona enferma, todo ello sumado al intento de mantener el funcionamiento cotidiano.",

      "abstract": "By adoption of older children we mean those who have lost in an early stage what should support a child: family, reliable and stable protection bonds helping the child grow, and a place of value for another person when there is no appropriate substitute given such absence. The abandonment and distress experienced promote a highly significant unbalance between chronological and emotional age. These repeated experiences of primary emotional deprivation normally trigger difficulty and sometimes inability to create a bond with another person recognized as reliable and who may ease the suffering.Bringing up an older child concealing a child emotionally suspended in very primary stages is one of the greatest obstacles and challenges parents face. Specific qualities and enhanced parental roles are required: family networks, professional teams, social and educational institutions protecting and sheltering the child and guiding adults in the burden upbringing involves. Taking care of caretakers so they can take care.Key words: Adoption, Older child, Early deprivation, Psychological damage, Antisocial behavior, Enhanced parental roles, Repair.",

Regardless of parental marital status, children spent the greatest proportion of their time in prosocial and dominance behaviors. Preschool children in single parent homes showed significantly more imitation and their siblings displayed more dominance and less prosocial behavior. No significant differences in levels of agonism were found. Despite this, the single mothers' perceptions of the sibling relationship were more negative than the married mothers'. This may be due to less emotionality and more sibling guidance in the relationship. The ultimate heallhfulness of this pattern of sibling interaction remains to be seen.",

      "abstract": "The detection of severe mental illness in any form on the part of offspring brings about a distinct pattern of reactions on the part of parents. It provides a severe blow to their self, in terms of both esteem and identity. There are feelings of ambivalence, guilt, grief, amidst other emotional states. Issues of parental identity come to the surface, which are accompanied by feelings of being marginalized and disenfranchised. Adopting an overprotective stance and thereby maintaining vigilance, grieving alone and grasping at straws are some common observations among such parents. Many appear to take drastic decisions of getting their adult children with mental illness married to 'solve' the problem, at least temporarily. Such decisions are propelled by the need of the parents to meet the social demands in accordance to expectations, to maintain their social status and prestige, and 'execute their parental duties' and responsibilities. However, this is sheer injustice on their part, bringing forth further problems for the unhealthy individuals and the family sub-system in general. It essentially highlights a pathological bent of mind-frame on the part of parents to ward off their personal crises and lifelong problems. The chapter pinpoints the injustice meted out to mentally unhealthy offspring by their 'responsive' parents, which needs dire attention of the society. The call of the day is thus to engage in increased psycho-education.",

Time spent in work, school, and other relationships made it difficult for young adults to spend time being with or helping family members. Other findings suggested a potentially higher level of family importance and connectedness among young adults from Filipino backgrounds as compared to their peers.",

      "abstract": "The increasing percentage of children living apart from their natural fathers is an unpredicted, and not widely discussed, trend. Fatherlessness is a major force behind many disturbing U.S. social problems. The institution of marriage acts as culture's chief vehicle to bind men to their children. The absence of fathers from children's lives is one of the most important causes of problems related to children's well-being such as increasing rates of juvenile violent crime, depression and eating disorders, teen suicide, and substance abuse. The economic difficulties experienced by mother-headed families ultimately account for many of the disadvantages found among fatherless children. Fathers make unique contributions to child rearing, including a parenting style different from mothers and an emphasis on play, which facilitates normal emotional development. The largest negative consequence of father absence is juvenile delinquency and violence, and early sexual activity. Marriage and childrearing act as extremely important civilizing forces for men; when there are large numbers of young, unattached males concentrated in one place, there are increases in social disorder. It is necessary to undo the cultural shift toward radical individualism to restore marriage and reinstate fathers in their children's lives. Changes in the attitudes and actions of employers, religious leaders, family scholars, marriage counselors, legislators, and the entertainment industry could strengthen the institution of marriage. Fathers' role must be redefined to involve full engagement in their children's development from the beginning. (Contains 33 references.)

The current study explored mothers and fathers (N = 40) in family violence, or high conflict past two years post separation, and their experiences within the Australian family law system. A thematic analysis was conducted on the interviews of separated mothers and fathers. Results revealed that the experience of engaging with the Australian family law system caused considerable anxiety and distress for these separated parents. Principal themes related to: (a) gendered narratives; (b) parents' concerns not been taken seriously; (c) perceived inadequacies in knowledge or competence of experts and decision makers in relation to family violence; and (d) coercion from some professionals within the family law system. These cumulative experiences tentatively pointed to an aftermath of long-term emotional and psychological trauma, not only for separated mothers and fathers, but also children in their care.",

La desobediencia a estas leyes se reflejara en un resquebrajado sistema social. Al haber realizado un estudio con enfoque de genero de las consecuencias socio familiares del embarazo en adolescentes, tomando como referencia al centro artesanal 24 de mayo, se ha podido visibilizar que existen un 31 % de casos de abortos que traen como consecuencias sentimientos de culpa, arrepentimiento, confusiones, afectando la salud mental de las mujeres. El porcentaje restante que tuvieron a su hijo o hija se deterioran fisica y psicologicamente impidiendo su desarrollo y autonomia, dependen economicamente, lo que lleva a un problema social: invisibilidad de su rol, discriminadas por el hecho de haber sido madres y de no contribuir en el hogar. Un 73% son solteras lo que demuestra la irresponsabilidad paterna, consecuentemente los hijos o hijas creceran bajo el cuidado y orientacion de la madre y su entorno. Un 100% de las mujeres cumple su rol reproductivo, algunas de ellas el triple rol (reproductivo, productivo y social) y otras no valoran su desempeno. Sorprendentemente se evidencia que los casos de embarazos en adolescentes se dan en mayor porcentaje en el area urbana.

      "abstract": "Prolonged litigation frequently leaves once-married and functional parents unable to communicate effectively and coparent with each other. The damage can be even more profound for never-married parents without a history of ever functioning as life partners or parenting partners. High-conflict parents often enter into parenting coordination following litigation through stipulation or court order. For some parents, this modality fails to provide enough support and containment of conflict, and postjudgment litigation continues long after the initial divorce. A clinical case study illustrates the use of an experimental, alternative dispute-resolution intervention we call \"the 2 Parenting Coordinator (PC) model.\" The 2 PC model evolved by applying the collaborative divorce 2-coach intervention to parenting coordination for a family in which traditional parenting coordination had twice failed. The case presented involved never-married parents, whose tenuous and mistrustful connection was threatening to contaminate the child's ability to have an emotionally secure relationship with her father.",

      "abstract": "Intervenir aupres d'une personne dependante pour l’accompagner dans les actes de sa vie quotidienne, a deux consequences majeures, a savoir : participer au moins partiellement a sa vie privee, entrer journalierement dans son intimite. Ces consequences ne sont un choix ni pour l'un, ni pour l’autre protagoniste, mais bien un effet ineluctable de cet accompagnement. Plus avant, l’intimite est usuellement partagee pour raison de survie organique et de bienseance sociale pour la personne handicapee, pour raisons professionnelles ou par engagement personnel pour les autres. Rien qui releve des usages habituels de l’intimite : pas de choix d'apprivoisement reciproque donc, et pas davantage de don et de contre don concu ou percu comme tel, simplement une necessite – la dependance - faisant force de loi.\r\nLa dependance concernant les besoins vitaux et/ou les actes de la vie quotidienne implique d’etre mis journalierement a nu, au risque d’une atteinte a la pudeur, d’etre accompagne dans de nombreuses activites par une aide humaine, au risque d’une publicisation de la vie privee, de voir penetrer son domicile plusieurs fois par jour, au risque de ne plus etre maitre chez soi. Ce qui suppose corollairement pour le professionnel de risquer de porter atteinte a autrui en de multiples occasions, et a divers niveaux, mais aussi, d’etre soi-meme affecte par diverses emotions eprouves en ces situations extra-ordinaires, par une charge psychique particuliere liee a l’attention a autrui, par des effets de resonnance et de resurgence decoulant de ses propres experiences de l’intimite. Si les risques ne sont pas identiques, ils sont neanmoins amplement partages. Une asymetrie cependant : l’intimite n’est pas reciproquement partagee.\r\nSi l’intimite varie dans ses formes et ses actualisations en fonction des aires culturelles, des periodes historiques, des statuts sociaux, elle reste une experience probablement universelle de la vulnerabilite de chaque etre lorsqu’une atteinte a son etre-meme est possiblement imminente. C’est pourquoi, etant donne l’importance accordee a la personne dans notre culture et nos textes legaux, le partage de l’intimite est usuellement choisi, sous le sceau de la confiance, et non pas contraint. Le consentement est un prerequis. Or, la dependance dans les actes de la vie quotidienne impose d’experimenter des modalites interactionnelles inhabituelles, hors des sentiers battus, de vivre des situations extra-ordinaires, de s’exposer a des situations peu conventionnelles. Le partage de l’intimite avec des aides humaines n’est souvent pas un choix, seulement une necessite, radicale dans ses consequences.\r\nCe chapitre est consacre a une description fine des divers impacts de ce partage de l’intimite par necessite, avec une focale concernant plus particulierement les incidences pour les personnes dependantes. Seront ainsi traites plusieurs dimensions de cette experience : le sentiment d’une dignite en sursis, le trouble emotionnel de l’ordre interactionnel, la publicisation de la vie privee, la possible institutionnalisation de la vie a domicile, l’impact sur l’ordre domestique et la « sedimentation biographique », l’atteinte au deploiement et au developpement d’une subjectivite reflexive.",

Data are from family reconstitutions and individual widowers and widows followed over a 2-year period from the year of the death of the spouse. The dependent variable, to be remarried within 2 years after the death of the spouse, is regressed on such factors as sex, age, time period, presence of minor children in the household, social status, rye prices, and interactions between these factors. The study has produced two main results: First, the decline in adult mortality alone cannot explain the decrease in the number of remarriages over time. Other factors associated with socioeconomic change and modernization of society (new occupations, better or new pension conditions, changing attitudes towards marriage, remarriage, elderly people, etc.) also played a role. Second, observed differences between sexes or between social groups in the number of remarriages to a large extent can be explained by the way that sex and social status interacted and thereby influenced the likelihood of getting married, especially when minor children were present in the household.",

To address this, formal child welfare services are increasingly interested in finding ways of avoiding rigid age-determined withdrawal of support by adopting various forms of extended care. This paper identifies continuous relationships between emerging adults and their previous foster carers as a source of relational informal extended care that has received little attention in practice, policy and research. Drawing on an expanded concept of family that recognises fostering as an underexplored iteration of kinship, the paper reports on a study of narrative accounts from 12 care-experienced emerging adults and their former foster carers (22 carers). Foster kinship normalised support as family practices, buffering the challenges of emerging adulthood, and offering an additional, informal, form of extended care for some care-experienced young people.",

It is a tradition which has roots in the Poor Law and which comes down to us today virtually unchanged. Only rarely can someone who depends heavily on others for personal help, and who for some reason does not have the support of — or wishes to live independently of — his or her family, find an alternative system of accommodation and care.

Variables to be considered are the age, sex and previous experiences of the child as well as the observer's viewpoint (clinician compared with social scientist): the need for well founded research is obvious. Divorce is a process affecting all family members: parent disharmony and quarrels prior to the divorce appear to be more detrimental to a child's adjustment than the separation itself which may represent a relief of tension. Behaviour and emotional problems following divorce relate to litigation regarding custody and access (accusations of sexual abuse during access are not uncommon), and a diminution of living standards. Feelings of rejection, depression, anger and guilt are frequent in the immediate post-divorce period, but settle during the ensuing year. Family counselling, individual work with children (especially explanations for younger ones) and social support in the post-divorce period are suggested as a means of combating long-term, sometimes lifelong, sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Families that are highly conflicted following separation are characterised by extended and often repeated episodes in the Family Court, high degrees of anger and distrust, incidents of verbal abuse, intermittent physical aggression, and ongoing difficulty both communicating and co-operating over the care of children (Johnston, Roseby and Kuehnle, 2009). Highly conflicted parents engage in frequent arguments and undermine each other in their parental role. Insults, threats and abuse, refusal to communicate, and arguments about the children are frequently witnessed by children. These children are particularly vulnerable (Chisholm, 2006; McIntosh and Chisholm, 2008) and in need of more support, reassurance, security and love than their parents are equipped to give them (Bagshaw, 1998). Such children are identified as the most at-risk group of separated families, and are particularly at risk of repeating these patterns of conflict and abuse when forming families of their own (Johnston et al., 2009).",

      "abstract": "Abstract The attachment process and the resultant caregiving behaviors are crucial components of an individual's feelings of self-worth. Loss of valued relations and support may adversely affect a person's psychological well-being. When such loss is experienced during the later years of life, the reorientation of attachment needs may become focused on a pet as a source and object of caring. Consequently, the loss of a pet can produce grief and mourning, which are intensified by the lack of supportive networks. The findings reveal that the people-pet bond has a positive influence on attachment needs. The active social lives of our sample do not mitigate the significance that pets paly in the elderly's attachment system. The absence of mourning rituals for the death of pets raises significant questions for the professional as to the most appropriate way to help the bereaved deal with the stress produced by the loss of a companion animal.",

Le hen entre les deux types de soins s'explique de diverses façons: le modèle rélie à la tâche, le modèle compensatoire, le modèle de substitution, le modèle supplémentaire et le modèle complémentaire (regroupant à la fois le modeèle compensatoire et les fonctions supplémentaires des soins officiels). Les explications ont été évaluées en fonction de données de l'Enquête sociale générate de 1985 concernant les personnes de 65 ans et plus ayant une invalidité fonctionnelle. On a évalué les données par analyse de régression logistique. Les résultats accordent la faveur à la fonction complémentaire des soins officiels. Selon les données, les soins officiels compensent l'absence de conjoint ou d'enfant et, dans certains cas restreints, remplacent le conjoint ou l'enfant soignant en matière de soins personnels et, dans une moindre mesure, sur le plan des tâches domestiques. Entre les deux, l'effet compensatoire des soins officiels semble primer l'effet de supplément.",

      "abstract": "This article is a study of an anti-child culture, with specific reference to divorce as a typical feature of such a culture in our own time. Education in contemporary society is being hampered by educational and societal factors. Rapid, dynamic change is inherent in this society, and families are by no means immune to it. Children are increasingly vulnerable to the uncertainties and confusions of bad marriages; and the number of single-parent families is rising as a direct result of divorce. The phenomenon of broken homes can result in numerous social problems associated with an anti-child culture. These, in turn, contribute to the phenomenal divorce rate that has such an impact on education. Children often experience divorce as an anti-child event that evokes a sense of guilt, uncertainty and not being wanted; and many juveniles vent their reaction to such a culture in socially unacceptable behaviour. Clearly, adequate education cannot take place in such conditions.",

In particular, studies on those who have not yet retired are aimed at specifying work suitable for older people and minimizing the strains that result from changing capacity with age. After retirement, the problems divide into two classes: (1) how to enable older people to cope with the business of living and thus remain substantially independent, and (2) how to care for them either at home or in institutions when this is no longer possible. These questions are almost certainly the driving force behind most biological, clinical, and immediately social research.",

However, findings highlighted unique developmental trajectories within subgroups of adolescents for prosocial behavior toward family and friends and found that maternal warmth and adolescent sympathy, self‐regulation, and gender consistently distinguished between groups.

      "abstract": "The strain of working with very old people can be considerable, as can the provision of their day-to-day care. The reasons for this are obvious. Whereas most very old people are normal adults with whom one can have a perfectly normal relationship, the very old people we are most likely to meet are those who have particularly severe problems. They will tend to be very dependent people with severe physical or mental infirmities, or people with major problems of resources, personality or behaviour. Combined with the extent of their problems is their complexity. Often old people that we come into contact with will have physical ailments, perhaps some psychiatric disorder and probably a lack of relatives as well. This severity and complexity of problems is hard enough to deal with, but the real strain is in the limited extent of our ability to help. The only solution may seem to be an admission to residential care, but this may not be desirable. Miss Gwenda Jones of Chapter 4, for example, presented the social worker with an interesting set of problems which proved very daunting. She was a severely arthritic old lady of 87 who lived in a house much too big for her requirements.",

The predictors examined were narcissistic traits and caregiving behaviors, with coparental cooperation and child characteristics as moderators. Results indicated that compared with married and noncustodial fathers, custodial fathers were more involved with their children, cooperated less with their children’s mothers, and viewed their children as being difficult. The interactions underscore the uniqueness of custodial fathers: Unlike married and noncustodial divorced fathers, custodial fathers were more accepting of their children, regardless of their avoidant caregiving. Coparental cooperation and narcissistic traits were associated with the greater involvement of noncustodial fathers compared with custodial fathers. In addition, child difficulty moderated the association between acceptance and narcissistic traits.",

Family Constitute of members such a mother-father and children. Such as parents are likely to be children. Children are the mirror to the habits of the parents, or sponges that absorb everything they see and hear from parents. However, when in family one of its membersis with the disease or disorder or has a disability, then in most cases, as in the relations changes between the couple and between the children of this couple. The study has as its point -relations, reports, connectivity cooperation of disabled person with their brothers and sisters within the family inside and outside. The results opresented here are conducted with 27 respondents who are living with a brother or sister with disabilities. The aim of the research is to tackle issues like relations between siblings and the person with disabilities, social relations, emotional sensitivity, the prospect of future and so on. The cast hypotheses have been aproved that beeing a sibiling of a brother or sister with disabilities affects their daily,social and emotional life. Based on the tradition and habits of albanian families living in these areas, and living together they have their life organized that most of their family members live in the same house.Reasons like this affect that the family members are affected by each other, even the consciousness and awereness of the other children by their parents for a sibling with disabilities and the wider family influence has also contributed to the creation of new social relationships and their socialization in general.So, some parts of their family life and a way a sibling interacts within the family with his or her brother/sister with disabilities has been explored. The survey was conducted in the south of the Republic of Serbia, in a residential area known as the Albanian-populated authocton province. It is important to mention this fact because taking into consideration these factors can also understand the results and achievements.",

      "abstract": "Living arrangements are a key dimension of quality of life and well being in old age. Availability of family care, as well as social and economic support, are in part a function of whom you live with. In order to be able to forecast future changes in household composition, particularly in relation to planning and targeting particular community care services, information is needed on the probability of a person experiencing a change in their living arrangements, and the life course events that may act as triggers. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991-99), it appears that amongst people aged 60 and over the majority of changes in living arrangements are due to either bereavement or a move into an institution. Although this is consistent with 'accepted wisdom' about the living arrangements of this age group, it is perhaps not so obvious that the majority of other changes should be related to the migration of younger generations. ‘Boomerang children’ appear to be major drivers of household change in later life, with the children moving in with their elderly parents rather than the older people themselves moving in with children, as one might expect. Changes involving younger generations are most common amongst people in their 60s, indicating that provision of a home for one’s children can extend well beyond middle age.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a period in which human organism develop rapidly physically and mentally. It is also the age of great searches and dreams, of affirmation and changes. Every adolescent achieves his own identity, learns to make decision and find his professional vocation. This period of development is focused on the search for one’s own values, can be a continuous source of stress, dissatisfaction, many doubts, disappointments and dissolutions. Stress is common phenomenon for different periods of development, but during adolescence because of multiple and different changes in adolescents’ life, stress is experienced and felt more intensely than in order periods of human development. Changes in social, economic and educational spheres conditionate a state of stress at modern adolescents demanding all their resources. Sources of stress for adolescents can be body changes, overloading at school, fear of evaluation, involvement in many activities, high expectations, demands and frustration in different school circumstances, negative thoughts and emotions about themselves, unsafe environment, family problems and difficulties. A high level of stress can generate physical disease, anxiety, different maladaptive behaviours such as: aggression, alcohol or drug consumption, isolation, etc.",

      "abstract": "Post-recession, middle-aged parents may provide various types of support to their grown children and parents. In the current study, parents age 40 to 60 (N =92) reported on a survey the support and affection they exchange with each child over age 18 (N =169) and each parent (N=185). The middle-aged generation (G2) differentiated among children (G3) and parents (G1) within families, and provided emotional, financial, and practical help on average to their children. The more dependent the child (G3), the more support was exchanged. Dependence was measured on normative status like education, employment, disability, and crisis as well as the emotional support and the overall affection. Parents (G1) received as a function of their dependence upon their children. Findings support contingency theory; downstream flow is more common in both physical and emotional support. Furthermore, the motivation the phenomenon is explained based on developmental stake theory and developmental schism to assure support later in life and progeny success. Finally, additional analysis of the upstream support found that a function of the existing relationship and individual factors based on caregiver burden, filial maturity, and appraisal impact the support exchange.",

We describe the main demographic features of this population: two-thirds are widows over 75, female residents are more likely to be dependent than male. We then survey the health, income, socio-professional background, networks, family relations, and everyday and social lives of institutional residents. Entry into an institution is mainly explained by poor health. Over half the residents are highly dependent (classified in dependency groups 1 to 3), and women are more likely to be dependent, and more likely to be more dependent. Family networks are looser than at home, but regular contact is maintained: visits by close family members are typically at least monthly. On the other hand, institutional residents exhibit low participation in cultural or leisure activities other than board games organized by the institution and watching television. Most residents claim to be broadly satisfied with their accommodation.",

      "abstract": "To explore existential loneliness among older people in different healthcare contexts from the perspective of healthcare professionals.Professionals meet and care for older people in most care contexts and need to be prepared to address physical, psychological, social and existential needs. Addressing existential loneliness can be both challenging and meaningful for professionals and is often not prioritised in times of austerity.A multiple case study design was used.Focus group interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals (n = 52) in home, residential, hospital and palliative care settings. The analysis was performed in two steps: firstly, a within-case analysis of each context was conducted, followed by a cross-case analysis.Differences and similarities were observed among the care contexts, including for the origin of existential loneliness. In home care and residential care, the focus was on life, the present and the past, compared to hospital and palliative care, in which existential loneliness mainly related to the forthcoming death. The older person's home, as the place where home care or palliative care was received, helped preserve the older person's identity. In hospital and palliative care, as in institutional care, the place offered security, while in residential care, the place could make older people feel like strangers. Creating relationships was considered an important part of the professionals' role in all four care contexts, although this had different meanings, purposes and conditions.The context of care matters and influences how professionals view existential loneliness among older people and the opportunities they have to address existential loneliness.Support for professionals must be tailored to their needs, their education levels and the context of care. Professionals need training and appropriate qualifications to address existential loneliness related to existential aspects of ageing and care.",

Bei der Betrachtung von manch einer zufällig oder zwangsweise zusammengestellten Gruppe kann man auch in der Tat sehr häufig am Ausdrucksverhalten ein hohes Stresslevel der Tiere erkennen, das auch Kämpfe mit massiven Verletzungen auslösen kann. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es jedoch auch Situationen, in denen eine größere Katzengesellschaft einträchtig zusammenlebt, wie es in manch einem Haushalt, aber auch auf vielen Bauernhöfen oder bei verwilderten Straßenkatzen der Fall sein kann. Der Grund für diese sehr gegensätzlichen Lebensweisen liegt in der ethologischen Tatsache begründet, dass Katzen fakultativ (freiwillig) sozial sind. Gruppen freilebender Hauskatzen bestehen überwiegend aus weiblichen Tieren, vereinzelt mit Jungkatern. Intakte Kater wandern meist ab und besuchen auf ihren Streifzügen mehrere Reviere weiblicher Katzen. Die Gruppenmitglieder sind meist miteinander verwandt, nur in seltenen Ausnahmefällen werden familienfremde Katzen in eine bestehende Gemeinschaft aufgenommen.",

Teknik pengumpulan data dengan wawancara sebagai metode utama dan observasi sebagai metode pendukung. Hasil penelitian tersebut menunjukan bahwa komunikasi keluarga dalam membangun kemandirian ABK tuna grahita harus dilakukan dengan metode yang tepat. Peran orang tua dan lingkungan keluarga merupakan faktor yang sangat menentukan keberhasilannya. Komunikasi keluarga melalui orientasi percakapan yang tinggi lebih efektif dalam melatih kemandirian ABK tuna grahita. Hal ini tercermin dalam sikap anggota keluarga yang lebih bebas, intensif dan secara spontan berinteraksi satu sama lain tanpa banyak batasan waktu atau topik yang dibahas. Selain itu melalui komunikasi orientasi konformitas yang tinggi juga cukup efektif dalam mendorong kemandirian ABK tuna grahita. Dengan pola komunikasi tersebut, lingkungan keluarga menciptakan kondisi yang akan mendorong ABK tuna grahita mematuhi aturan yang akan melatih kemandirian.&#x0D; &#x0D; Kata Kunci: Pola Komunikasi Keluarga, Kemandirian, Tuna grahita",

It explores a moment of futurity: the experience of children as temporal successors to parents' lives. A moment of sexual history is also examined. It then looks at the moment of birth itself, including (in the past) people's occasional contemplation of infanticide. It evaluates the time of child care and companionship in the present, and the creation of attachment. Children as social others are objects of a complex kind of intertemporal, intersubjective consciousness on the part of the parents. Korowai often disagreed over the fate of a particular newborn but they do not consider infanticide itself an immoral act. Korowai experience a social relation between parent and child as a corporeal condition. It is likely that the broad patterns of Korowai parent-child attachment are representative of people's approaches to social attachment at large.",

In four experiments testing over 400 children, we investigated children's memories for small acts of giving and taking. When asked to recall their own giving and taking, children were relatively accurate following a number of delays. In contrast, when asked to recall a child's giving or taking, children exaggerated the child's taking after a 1-day or 1-week delay. Notably, this pattern of misremembering occurred only when children recalled the actions of a child but not an adult. We consider the idea that children spontaneously engage in social comparison, which colors their memories of the social world.",

The ones who can best help however are the child's own family, particularly the mother, who is in a position through her physical proximity and 'emotional closeness' to communicate an essential feeling of security and belonging to the sick child. In some families the problems arise from the mixed feelings parents have towards their handicapped child. In some extreme cases the parents' self-confidence may be so shaken when they produce a handicapped child whose life expectancy is short that they feel unable to take the baby home from hospital. This child's acceptance into his family then depends on how the parents are told, and the expertise with which the situation is handled. The important part played by non-verbal communication, particularly with a younger child, cannot be over-emphasised with parents.",

Parents pay much more than the return they’ll get when they’re old, which mainly relates to the utilities of children. In countryside, the utilities of children (especially sons) manifest in following aspects: continuing the family line, emotional comfort, laborer and supporting for old age. To some extent, these factors influence the rural intergenerational injustice respectively and together. From the prospective of trend of social and economic development, the caring of the retired will be taken by social insurance system; the intergeneration exchange on supporting each other between parents and offspring will no longer be a social issue, but in the vast rural areas, the influence of traditional culture family lineage is still powerful. The need of caring of the old becomes so weak that emotional effect becomes much more urgent. The weak status of the old generation bring the fathers’ generation in a weak social status, which seriously affect the living conditions of the old generations. Therefore, when focusing the caring issue in the country, besides that we should ensure the old be cared materially, what matters most is keep the balance between the exchanging two sides",

      "title": "Family Estrangement and the Unseen Work of <i>Not Doing</i> Family",
      "abstract": "Family estrangement is a common yet understudied phenomenon, especially in the sociology of family and personal life. In societies where norms about ‘the family’ have moved on considerably to include non-biological kinship, blended families, chosen families and so on, an emphasis on close bonds and family rituals is often resilient creating stigma for those who are distant from family. In this article, I offer a sociological analysis of experiences of family estrangement reported via a qualitative survey, and explore three of the family practices involved in maintaining these ‘absent present’ relationships. This research contributes to and extends literature on family practices, family display and the notion of doing family, by looking at the family practices that are kept off display and the often unseen work that goes into not doing family. In doing so, it speaks to a growing interest in the constitutive role of absent, silenced or hidden aspects of social life, and attending questions about the impacts of such omissions.",

Correlations are reported between three alternative measures of old age adaptability (coping, defense, and disorganization) and measures in five areas of status and behavior in young adulthood (representing a 40 year longitudinal analysis). Coping ability in old age is most associated with variations in intellectual capacity and socioeconomic status, especially for women. Ego disorganization in old age is most related to variations in socioeconomic status and family relations in young adulthood. The data suggest that adaptability in old age is associated with environments and behaviors early along the adult life course but that the strength of over-time connection varies according to the sex of the subject, the model of old age adaptability used, and the aspects of status and behavior considered in young adulthood.",

De las entrevistas con refugiados afganos que se mudaron a Vancouver (Canada) durante su etapa adolescente, se desprende que todos los entrevistados se encontraban satisfechos de haber mantenido unas relaciones intergeneracionales fuertes, pero muchos de ellos tambien se habian visto influidos por las normas sociales occidentales. Un joven de 23 anos declaro que ser capaz de mantener contacto visual con los mayores le permitia evaluar sus reacciones ante sus palabras, un aspecto comunicativo importante.

      "abstract": "Abstract Older adults living in subsidized housing experience health disparities including disproportionate rates of social isolation and nursing home admission. Little is known about how social relationships and social environment influence aging in place for this population. We interviewed 58 residents aged 62 or older. Qualitative thematic analyses revealed that social relationships both inside and outside the building contributed to residents’ experience of aging in place. Relationships with other residents and staff members provided social support, while connections to family and friends outside the building “opened up” the residents’ world and provided a sense of connection to the larger community. Social and physical environment also contributed, with residents’ ability to move between private and public spaces leading to feelings of freedom and independence. Discussion focuses on expanding definitions of aging in place to encompass residents’ experiences and implications for improving aging in place for this population.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to a range of environmental adversities increases the risk of disorder in children through the biological embedding of environmental risk. Environmental influences are best conceptualized as embedded layers of context with macro environments influencing micro environments which in turn have effects on children's development. Poverty and social position in the society, war and exposure to violence in neighborhoods have all been shown to have influences on the development of child psychopathology. Some of this influence operates indirectly through the proximal environment (children's relationships) while some of the effect is direct to the child. Children's relationships with parents, peers, siblings and teachers are more negative and problematic, the more problematic the macro-context. When these relationships are problematic, children show higher levels of disorder. Understanding the mechanism in the association between environmental adversity and children's mental health is complex, however, as child characteristics influence children's experiences in family and friendship relationships. Finally, it is very important to recognize that the vulnerability of children to environmental stressors varies enormously, based on characteristics of children and their relational environments.",

      "title": "Mother guarding: how offspring may influence the extra-pair behaviour of their parents",
      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel form of social control of mate choice. Through mother guarding, offspring can help in protecting the paternity of their father by preventing their mother from engaging in extra-pair matings. We present a model that predicts the circumstances under which mothers should be selected to seek or avoid extra-pair matings, and existing offspring should be selected to prevent or promote such matings. In its simplest form, our model shows that offspring are selected to mother guard as long as the viability of extra-pair young is less than twice that of within-pair young; when the relative viability is greater, offspring are selected to promote extra-pair mating by their mother. If the existing offspring are not necessarily sired by their mother's social mate, then the potential for conflict is further reduced. We also consider whether offspring have an interest in the extra-pair reproduction of their fathers. We show that when the costs of the father's infidelity to the mother's brood are high, existing offspring are selected to prevent extra-pair mating by their father; when such costs are low, offspring are selected to promote extra-pair mating by their father. In principle, our model applies to all species where offspring show delayed dispersal and where breeding pairs raise multiple broods or litters. This situation exists in, but is not limited to, the majority of cooperatively breeding species. The significance of this model with regard to our current understanding of the evolution of extra-pair behaviour in such species is discussed.",

      "abstract": "A number of theoretical models may help us understand the importance of parent–child relationships during emerging adulthood and how these relationships are important for development during the third decade of life. Social learning theory suggests that individuals learn by observing one another. Specifically, the learner imitates the behavior of another person who is demonstrating, or modeling, a particular behavior. Parenting styles are characterized as making up the broad, overarching emotional climate of the relationship between parents and children and theoretically moderate the link between more specific parenting practices and children’s outcomes. In other words, specific parenting strategies or practices may be more or less effective depending on the parenting style or climate of the overall relationship. Throughout childhood and adolescence, three important dimensions of parenting have been identified, including support, autonomy granting and control. Research on parental support during emerging adulthood exists in many forms, with little attempt at connection across literatures.",

A critical period is, in fact, any stage in life during which the individual is most likely to benefit from certain kinds of learning experiences. If we are denied these experiences at the appropriate time, the learning concerned may be more difficult to achieve later on. In some instances, there may be a considerable gap in time between the critical period and the age at which the learning manifests itself. Thus children deprived of a warm and loving relationship with their care-givers in early life may find it more difficult to provide such a relationship for their own children in the future, as any veteran social worker who has watched the depressing cycle of aggressive and violent parenting styles pass from one generation to the next will readily confirm.",

The research has confirmed that the parents opted for a larger number of children under the changed circumstances should relate to the government to take greater responsibility in this area. Programs do not necessarily have to be of material nature. They may include a variety of content-creative measures aimed at increasing the birth rate and the quality of family life by activating various discussions in the local community. National measures that would contribute to a harmonious family life are associated with an increased level of security, extended work of preschool institutions in order to harmonize work and family life and the introduction of discounts on equipment and clothing for the preschool children. In addition to reproductive functions, other functions of the family are: psychological, educational and socializing over the last decade (particularly after the introduction of compulsory pre-school program), which has led to the transformation of active strategies of the state and legislation in this regard and acceptance of the principle of lifelong learning in which preschool foundation plays a crucial role in the adaptation of compulsory education by providing equal starting conditions for all children. The existence of new forms of institutions such as family centers with a differentiated system of services (consulting, information, educational) should compensate deficiencies of the existing system only on the basis of social protection embodied in the social welfare centers, which are available mostly in cases of pre-existing problems.",

      "title": "Family Caregiving Amidst Age‐Associated Cognitive Changes: Implications for Practice and Future Generations",
      "abstract": "Abstract As the number of older adults has increased, so has the prevalence of age‐associated needs, including cognitive changes. Correspondingly, more than 43 million people provide care for an older family member whose needs range from basic household maintenance to 24‐hour care. Those who serve aging families exclusively or work with multigenerational families face the challenges of inaccurate and/or incomplete information, confusing and unreachable services, and uncertainty about managing stress and ways to foster resilience within multigenerational family systems. Thus, the purpose of this article is to highlight the prevalence of age‐associated cognitive changes and how they relate to the short‐ and long‐term family resilience processes. More specifically, this article is directed to orient practitioners to the critical roles caregivers play, and individual, relational, and sociological dynamics of cognition, care, and resilience are discussed. The authors provide an overview of assumptions and outcomes related to caregiving, as well as considerations for care recipients, including personhood and empowerment. Finally, because practitioners become a key ingredient in navigating the normative and nonnormative processes of aging, the authors provide a checklist of relational processes to focus on when working with aging families, along with specific recommendations for practice for family life educators and marriage and family therapists.",

      "abstract": "Secondary clients: a discourse analysis of affinity and kinship\r\n\r\nIn recent years, a trend has developed in care-giving systems. It was previously thought that care for our elderly, physically disabled or chronically ill relatives and loved ones, was to be provided by and cared for in institutions. As of now, we see a retrograding trend where a lot of the treatment and/or care is to be provided in homes and carried out under the auspices of the family or next of kin. The trend is a result of what, in Sweden, is called Kvarboendeprincipen, the Stay home principle, deriving from the normality perspective – to make it feasible for all to live at home in a normal environment for as long as possible, even when in need of certain care. To implement that ideal, supportive and relieving interventions are given to nursing and caring relatives of primary clients and next of kin: the secondary clients. A few of those actions, which are provided by governmental and other formal care-giving systems, are counseling, education or monetary compensation for loss of income.\r\nHow these supports and relievements are organized and carried out, is formed by the popular notion on affinity and kinship, read and interpreted in Swedish law and policy documents. On this basis I have analyzed and thus found four themes, initially presented by Twigg (1994), with an analysis-scheme constructed from her theory and Faircloughs critical discourse analysis (1992). I have found that these separated themes also represent presumed agendas that often collide in the process of nursing and caring for dependent relatives. The different themes which are presented as the four main aspects of acting as an informal care-giver, are foremost, not the voices of the care-givers themselves, but rather the voice of society and government, who is also dependent of the informal care-givers interventions and efforts, and therefore indicate an expectation of engagement from families.",

The men who took part in a longitudinal study, all in their 40s, had severe adjustment problems as teenagers, and thus have a past that causes uncertainty about their parenting abilities in the present. The paper analyses the men’s affective investments in their ways of being fathers. Four analytical categories that address the men’s fathering experiences were identified as significant in the interviews. First unsettling relations and distance from their own children, which for many of the men appeared as a recurring pattern that resembled the relationships they had with their own parents. Second, several men emphasised capacities such as personal traits or strength that made them able to make a break with the past. Third, the importance of support from others was also recognised, particularly being able to share parenthood with the children’s mother and for some, receiving help from child welfare services. Fourth, a key finding is that all the men, independent of whether they live with their children or not, experience a fragile point of balance, that is, incidents such as a relapse into drug abuse or a break in their relationship with the other parent strongly affect their relationships with their children. The difficulties these men experienced as youth intersect with their experiences of their own capacities as fathers in the present.",

      "abstract": "This chapter highlights the significant role that the couple relationship plays in promoting positive or negative developmental outcomes for children. Historically, the primary focus of intervention within families has been on promoting positive parenting practices in alleviating disrupted family relationship influences on children. Family relationship breakdown is recognised as a risk factor for negative psychological outcomes among children of all ages. Parenting has also been identified as an important mediator underlying links between the interparental relationship and child psychological outcomes, particularly in terms of child antisocial behaviour. Multiple family influences have been identified in past research as serving as risk factors for children's negative psychological development. Children raised in households exposed to acute or chronic economic strain, heightened levels of parental psychopathology, negative parent-child relations, and parental separation, divorce, and remarriage have been shown to experience a variety of negative psychological outcomes, including increased anxiety, depression, hostility and criminality.",

Unfortunately, family members are frequently perpetrators of elder family financial exploitation (EFFE). To understand possible EFFE precursors, the Elder Family Financial Exploitation Survey (EFFES) collected hierarchical data (individual relatives nested within families) including respondent and elder demographics, financial exploitation details if it occurred, and family dynamics (general family functioning, fairness conflict, resource exchange patterns, entitlement attitudes, and communication/problem-solving). Multilevel logistic regression models found positive association with greater fairness conflict and entitlement attitudes, and negative association with general family function, resource exchange expectations, and communication patterns when growing up, but no association with current communication. Findings can prompt families to proactively address negative family dynamics to reduce the risk of EFFE. Results may also inform decisions about appointing other fiduciaries, e.g., trustees, and personal representatives (executors).",

Older children drew themselves holding pets significantly more often, but younger children placed the family-figure between the self and the pet significantly more often. There were no significant gender differences in self-figure/pet-figure distances, but cats, dogs, caged animals, and farm animals were placed significantly closer to self-figures than were fish. Over-all, owners were clearly emotionally closer to pets than to family members, but nonowners were as close emotionally to family members as were owners.",

The child's tendency to direct attachment behavior to a specific figure rather than to whoever is nearby has led to the idea of monotropy, suggesting that a child would thrive best with one special attachment figure. From an evolutionary perspective kinship caregiving networks are more plausible as they would increase the chances of survival, and in hunter-gatherer and agricultural communities paternal care and kinship networks providing care for young children were indeed common. A recent development in cultural evolution is the invention of organized day care and children's homes and institutions. Although the attachment network may increase in size with the child's cognitive development, research on institutionalized care demonstrates that high numbers of caregivers preclude secure attachments. The limiting factor to attachment networks may however not be the number of caregivers, but the opportunities for the child to learn contingencies in social relationships that have an attachment component.",

However, the overall treatment should emphasize changing maladaptive behavior and adverse environmental conditions. Relevant approaches include structured educational group treatment, task assignment, cognitive restructuring of maladaptive self-beliefs, reframing of the divorce experience as a challenge to growth, family treatment involving inperson contact with young adult children, and advocacy to end age discrimination in the hiring and wages of middle-aged women.",

Owing to gender equality, women are rising to prominence in the area of work, which is one of the significant factors influencing the formation of gender roles. We can observe men slowly entering the private sphere where they are involved in activities limited to taking care of their children. Nevertheless, the asymmetry between the genders persists in both public and private life; the situation has not changed dramatically. However, the emancipation has enabled women to achieve an important position in the society and they are obviously reluctant to lose it. Their awareness of the issue is outrunning the current situation in the society. Striving for success in the labour market, women are now less active at home than they were in the past. Reproduction is no longer a priority in women’s life; instead, they plan their family carefully. As a result of active participation of women in the public area of work, indirect change in family life gave rise to new types of parenthood (new motherhood, new parenthood) and a different attitude towards childhood (protective childhood). Moreover, the resulting new requirements of parenthood are increasingly demanding and exert influence on educational institutions, especially kindergartens. Parents tend to demand more from kindergarten teachers, while children are also changing. The consequences are visible in educational styles, the expectations of parents and their powerlessness.",

It can also favour the development of psychological disorders, as well as the manifestation of outbursts of uncontrolled anger, oppositionality, and, in the most serious cases, the committing of antisocial behaviors, characterised by attitudes of contempt, disregard, and the violation of other people’s rights. The family can play an important role in the prevention of antisocial behavior and in the promotion of socially shared and constructive conduct.",

The scoping review questions are the following: (i) What is the existing literature on the complementarity between formal and informal care? (ii) Which are the types of formal cares' services/interventions that have been described in the literature as complementary to informal care, provided to the informal caregiver and/or to the adult being cared for? (iii) Which outcomes have been assessed in the caregiver's physical, psychological, and social health domains, and how have they been measured?",

It is understood as a functional and/or emotional change of roles in which the child subordinates their own needs in order to adapt to and take care of the instrumental or psychological needs of the parent. The presented research is embedded in the interpretive paradigm. The research material allows the author to distinguish specific stages of parentified childhood (proper childhood, transition phase, adult childhood), within which appear categories such as responsibility, involuntary heroism, self-containment and loneliness. With regard to the last two categories, the author wishes to construct the image of a lonely child experiencing the reversal of family roles. There is a peculiar paradox at work: the loneliness of the child within the family environment. There is a lonely struggle for the survival and proper functioning of the family, while keeping up the appearance of a normally functioning family, maintaining family homeostasis, and meeting their own needs and those of their loved ones.",

Dazu wird rekonstruiert, wie Nachkommen das Schweigen ihrer Eltern bezüglich deren Erfahrungen mit FSZM erlebten. Das methodische Vorgehen orientiert sich an der Grounded Theory Methodologie. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die verschwiegene elterliche Geschichte aus Sicht der Nachkommen gleichzeitig als an- und abwesend erlebt wird. Die Anwesenheit zeigt sich in Form fragmentierter verbaler Kommunikationsformen und Erfahrungen stiller Präsenz. Dazu gehören u. a. Gefühle der Nachkommen, oder elterliche Verhaltensweisen, die von den Nachkommen in Bezug auf die verschwiegene Vergangenheit gedeutet werden. Die Abwesenheit wird durch vermeidende Kommunikationsformen, sowie durch Erfahrungen stiller Absenz erlebt, die sich in Kontaktlosigkeit zu Familienangehörigen äußert. Das anhand der empirischen Daten entwickelte konzeptuelle Modell fasst das erlebte Schweigen der Nachkommen als Erfahrungen der An- und Abwesenheit der elterlichen Geschichte. Es skizziert Handlungsstrategien, sowie subjektive Deutungen der Auswirkungen hinsichtlich des elterlichen Schweigens. Deutlich wird, dass das Schweigen der Eltern und dessen Konsequenzen für die Nachkommen mit spezifischen Belastungen einhergehen kann, die ausgehalten und bewältigt werden müssen.",

Over the next five years, as his horizons become wider and his experiences outside the home increase exponentially, he seems to become more reserved; more difficult to approach and share things with. Sometimes, ordinary questions are ignored or responded to with some apparently unrelated answer. Occasionally, the child will move away even while someone is speaking to him. This is a child trying to make sense of his new experiences, adapting to new people and places, while preserving his link to his earlier environment. Adults can feel frustrated by this behaviour and impatient, but when moved to protest, tend to use words of exasperation rather than plain anger.",

Encontrar ambitos y contexto de intervencion, en donde ellos puedan ejercer su responsabilidad, les ayudara a creer como padreas y como personas. La perspectiva es generar estructuras de pensamiento y trabajo en un plano de colaboracion familias, sociedad y escuela/profesionales en lugar de establecer una jerarquia profesional-familia en la cual esta ultima es solamente receptora pasiva de las orientaciones e intervenciones. La participacion activa de la familia en todas las fases del proceso de atencion a la persona con discapacidad es fundamental, lo que no debe obviar el estudio de las necesidades de apoyo de la propia familia.",

      "abstract": "Household and childcare responsibilities, peer contacts, and out-of-home activities of older same-sex siblings of mentally retarded children as compared to a group of matched nonhandicapped children were examined. Older siblings of retarded children, particularly older sisters, assumed multiple caretaking responsibilities. For these siblings, increased childcare responsibilities were associated with sibling conflict and decreased opportunities for peer contacts and out-of-home activities. As a group, however, siblings of retarded children did not differ from their agemates in frequency of contact with friends or participation in out-of-home activities. Retarded younger siblings had less contact with friends than did their nonhandicapped agemates. Within-group differences appeared to be more important in understanding sibling risk status than whether the child had a younger retarded sibling.",

Zum Erwerb dieser sozialen Kompetenz muss das Kind den Konflikt zwischen Autonomie und Konformität lösen. Der lustvolle Umgang mit den Ausscheidungen wird dem Ekelregime unterworfen. Misslingt dieser Entwicklungsschritt, ist die gesellschaftliche Teilhabe gefährdet. Das Ringen um Sauberkeitsprinzipien stellt die pädagogischen Fähigkeiten der Eltern auf die Probe. Die von Eltern bei der eigenen Reinlichkeitserziehung erlebten Emotionen werden in Familien mit stuhlinkontinenten Kindern reaktiviert. Subklinische psychische Symptome bis hin zu manifesten psychischen Störungen finden sich bei stuhlinkontinenten Kindern und deren Familienangehörigen deutlich häufiger als in der Normalbevölke-rung. Sie können sowohl Ursache und aufrechterhaltender Faktor als auch Folge der kindlichen Symptomatik und der damit verbundenen familiären Interaktionsproblematik sein. Sekundäre Stuhlinkontinenz kann durch Belastungssituationen ausgelöst werden. Invasive Diagnostik und rigide Behandlungsschemata können traumatisieren und dysfunktionales Verhalten chronifizieren.",

      "title": "SIBLING-TO-SIBLING DEMENTIA CARE: UNDERSTANDING MOTIVATIONS, CHALLENGES, AND EXPERIENCES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Caregiving research has traditionally focused on older adult siblings’ involvement in shared social activities and emotional support, while offering limited exploration of instrumental help provided by siblings when their brothers/sisters face a health-related event or long-term illness. Moreover, there is a notable gap in understanding how siblings navigate the complexities of caring for their community-dwelling sibling living with dementia (SLwD). We begin to address this gap by examining determinants of sibling dementia caregiving roles, individual and family challenges older adult sibling caregivers encounter, and factors that facilitate their provision of care. From a mixed-methods analysis of interviews with 25 sibling caregivers, comprised of 12 sisters caring for sisters, 10 sisters caring for brothers, and 2 brothers caring for brothers (Mage = 68.03 years, R = 52-83; 48% African American; 52% co-residing), several key insights emerged. Motivations for assuming the caregiving role included shared life experiences, availability due to non-employment, personal or professional caregiving experience, and the absence or limited involvement of the SLwD immediate family. Early-life relationship conflicts, challenges in managing dementia-related symptoms, and divided family loyalties added complexity to the caregiving role. Sibling caregivers who received support from other family members and paid caregivers in caring for SLwD reported lower role captivity and caregiver burden. Caregiving experiences intersected with birth order, race, and socioeconomic status. Discussion focuses on when and why siblings take on the caregiving role for their SLwD, nuanced differences on how they manage their caregiving responsibilities, and implications for extended family caregiving practices and support.",

      "abstract": "Scholars of the family agree on four main parenting styles, varying along two axes: responsiveness and control. Parental involvement and child autonomy fall under the control axis and are assumed to have an inverse relationship; where parental involvement is high, child autonomy is assumed to be low, and vice versa. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews and participant observation at five homeschooling conferences, we examine the dominant parenting philosophies and practices of conservative Christian homeschoolers (which we call “ownership parenting”) and secular unschoolers (which we call “partnership parenting”). We demonstrate that the inverse relationship between parental involvement and child autonomy is not present in partnership parenting, which is marked by both high parental involvement and high child autonomy. Unschooling thus represents an empirical case against the theoretical conflation of parental involvement and child autonomy; a new expanded typology is thus posited that divides the control axis into two distinct axes.",

      "title": "Parental Alienation, DSM-V, and ICD-11",
      "abstract": "Parental alienation is an important phenomenon that mental health professionals should know about and thoroughly understand, especially those who work with children, adolescents, divorced adults, and adults whose parents divorced when they were children. We define parental alienation as a mental condition in which a child—usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict divorce—allies himself or herself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. This process leads to a tragic outcome when the child and the alienated parent, who previously had a loving and mutually satisfying relationship, lose the nurture and joy of that relationship for many years and perhaps for their lifetimes. The authors of this article believe that parental alienation is not a minor aberration in the life of a family, but a serious mental condition. The child's maladaptive behavior—refusal to see one of the parents—is driven by the false belief that the alienated parent is a dangerous or unworthy person. We estimate that 1% of children and adolescents in the U.S. experience parental alienation. When the phenomenon is properly recognized, this condition is preventable and treatable in many instances. There have been scores of research studies and hundreds of scholarly articles, chapters, and books regarding parental alienation. Although we have located professional publications from 27 countries on six continents, we agree that research should continue regarding this important mental condition that affects hundreds of thousands of children and their families. The time has come for the concept of parental alienation to be included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V), and the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Edition (ICD-11).",

This chapter explores why some children may find the transition particularly unsettling. It begins with a detailed description of the kinds of experiences that might make the transfer from primary to secondary school emotionally unsettling, highly confusing or even distressing. Especially in inner-city schools, there will be a significant number of children who have complex histories linked to an unstable home life: bereavement, separation or loss; changes in family composition or being a looked-after child. As school therapists, they are ideally positioned to offer Year 7 pupils a chance to process their ending at primary school, think about how secondary school is panning out for them and, if relevant, raise awareness amongst other school staff of difficulties or complexities at home.",

Their behaviors were more diverse when they socialized with a different age class. Initially, the mother and infant interacted more with females than males, but later more with males. The mother’s associations with juveniles and infants were high as her infant became more socially active with its peers.

The patterns were: Even closer; Just us now; New roles, responsibilities, and relationships; Unsettled estate; Never close; From bad to worse; Back together, temporarily; and No change. Implications for social work practice include exploring perceptions of family members regarding patterns and using the concept of ambivalence to normalize sibling relationships.",

Data were from 510 parents (aged 70–97 years at baseline) who reported on their 1496 adult children in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, with seven observations over ten years. Joint care potential considered the number of children and their care potential types. Children with high care potential lived nearby, had frequent contact, and had significant emotional and instrumental support exchanges with their parent. For unpartnered parents, each additional child increased the likelihood of receiving intergenerational care. Having children with high care potential further increased this likelihood. For partnered parents, receiving care was more likely if all children had medium or high care potential; an additional child only contributed under this condition. Policies and practice should not assume that older parents will receive care solely based on having multiple children or a child living nearby.",

      "abstract": "Having clarified the concept of serious physical handicap, the author takes into consideration the multiple components that could favour or compromise the development of a handicapped child. The way in which the social health structure communicates to the parents the diagnosis of a seriously handicapped person plays a determining role. This could facilitate the acceptance or even risk provoking refusal. It should also be pointed out that the couple, whether conjugal or parental, if not timely and constantly supported could hasten the run down of the development and even break it and this could eventually even have repercussions on the entire family structure. Particular attention ought to be paid to the psychological reactions of individual members: mother, father and siblings. In order that the parents and the entire family are not weighed down by the sufferings caused by the presence by one who is seriously handicapped, it is important that they are not socially isolated. Hence, support by the social health system is fundamentally important, both in rehabilitation and in psychotherapy. These persons should be fully aware of all the conscious and unconscious dynamics in the family structure and know how to manage them so that they favour as serene as possible an ambient with regard to the handicapped person.",

The conundrum arises from the fact that even self-described child advocates typically fail to reach consensus about the scope of children’s rights. Some are child-savers committed to societal engagement in children’s protection. Typically, they focus on children’s vulnerability and dependency, and they often set a low threshold for state intervention in the lives of children and families, whether for protection of their interests or assurance of the requisites for healthy development. They commonly believe that children’s best interests demand their protection from themselves, not just from environments that are inadequate or even harmful. Such an approach is likely to be applied with particular vigor in regard to young children, who may be presumed to be vulnerable to even brief disruptions of their care or safety.",

Findings indicate that parents value play for their child’s development and education, for building relationships and self-esteem, for processing emotional experiences, for relaxation, and for fun. Many parents expressed a preference for active outdoor play, as well as pretend and creative play, board games, and puzzles, explaining that they discouraged television and video games, aggressive play, and play with sexual themes. Children reported enjoying active outdoor play, toys, construction and art activities, and video game play, with parents, siblings, friends, and pets.

La investigacion cualitativa permite mostrar los particulares sentimientos y emociones de las personas para asi comprender mejor a este colectivo y poder desarrollar habilidades y estrategias para ayudar a superar este sentimiento. Los resultados de esta investigacion, ponen en valor una dinamica familiar, sentimientos personales, afectos y relaciones interpersonales. Las instituciones residenciales, asi como, los trabajadores de las mismas, deberian tener en cuenta estas emociones para tener una buena relacion terapeutica del binomio familiar-residente. EnglishIn 21st century, the elderly in present-day society live their last days in residential care homes which are enabled to that end. The reasons could arise from physical and cognitive impairment, family reasons, the person�s own determination or a consensus between family and the elder. The process may affect family members. There are plenty of factors ( sensation of fault or abandonment of a loved one, ...) that go into feeling guilty or dissatisfied. These feelings may be supported by either historical or cultural idea that placing a relative in a residential facility means you are abandoning him/her. Qualitative research allows insights into how people�s feelings and emotions are in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this group and to be able to develop skills and strategies used to overcome this feeling. The results of this research show the great value of a family dynamic, personal feelings, affections and interpersonal relationships. Residential institutions, as well as their workers, should take these emotions into account in order to have a good therapeutic relationship between resident and family.

      "abstract": "The transitional nature of military life positions the family to serve as the primary and most stable influence for adolescents in military families. These military-related transitions and stressors may also put youth at risk for depression and academic challenges. This study examines the relative impact of family structure (family composition at a given time point) and family processes (interpersonal interactions developed over time) on important adolescent outcomes (depressive symptoms and academic performance) for a sample of military youth ( N = 995). While family structure, particularly being part of a stepfamily or single-parent family, was related to greater depressive symptoms and poorer academic performance, family processes (family support and parent–adolescent connection) and personal resources (initiative) also accounted for depressive symptomology and academic performance. Importantly, when modeling family processes, no differences were found across family structures. Military youth thrive in diverse family forms in the presence of healthy family processes.",

      "abstract": "Permanent, supportive housing for people with a history of homelessness is often a first step toward regaining stability in other life areas, but such housing may not always feel like “home.” Whether supportive housing feels like “home” has received increasing attention due to links with positive identity reconstruction, housing stability, and improved community engagement. This qualitative study explored what makes supportive housing feel like “home” for individuals who were once homeless. Semi-structured interviews were completed among 37 adults with physical and/or psychiatric disabilities who were currently living in congregate or independent permanent housing in Boston, Massachusetts. Three themes emerged regarding what makes housing feel like “home”: (a) safe spaces, (b) connections to “regular stuff” and past occupations, and (c) agency to choose and pursue personal goals. Feelings of “home” were associated with a safe, peaceful environment where participants preferred to spend time in solitary activities. However, housing that felt like “home” also provided a base to engage in daily routines and community activities, reconnecting participants to “everyday things people do.” Findings are interpreted related to constructing a new, nonhomeless identity, and current issues of social isolation and limited community integration affecting individuals who were once homeless.",

Objetivo: caracterizar las experiencias que, en la historia de vida de jovenes homosexuales, han influido en la practica del sexo transaccional. Metodos: se realizo un estudio descriptivo, de corte transversal, durante los anos 2012 y 2013. La muestra la conformaron 25 jovenes homosexuales pertenecientes al policlinico Ana Betancourt, a los que se les realizo entrevista abierta y semiestructurada. Resultados: el ambito familiar constituye, en la totalidad de los entrevistados, un espacio de conflicto y frustracion, manifestandose prohibiciones e incomprensiones de los familiares vinculados a la identidad de genero y sexo-erotica. Se constato frustracion e inestabilidad en el area de pareja; sobrevaloracion de la figura materna, vinculada a la necesidad de afecto, y una valoracion negativa de la paterna, asociada a la percepcion de rechazo por una orientacion sexual diferente. La necesidad de afecto era canalizada a traves de las relaciones interpersonales y en el marco de la practica de sexo transaccional. Resultaron motivaciones para esta practica, poder emigrar a otros lugares donde puedan suplir las carencias detectadas. Conclusiones: las experiencias de vida, vinculadas a la practica del sexo transaccional, confirman y consolidan las concepciones entorno a la doble moral. Las que mas influyen en la practica de este acto son las vivenciadas en las areas familiar, de pareja y psicosexual.",

      "title": "Reclaiming “good motherhood”: US mothers’ critical resistance in family homeless shelters",
      "abstract": "Unhoused mothers not only contend with housing precarity and economic hardship but also intersecting classist, racist, and sexist stereotypes that position them as unfit mothers. Classed, raced, and gendered conceptualizations of “good” and “bad” motherhood are reified in US shelter regulations (e.g. strict rules governing parent and child behavior, curfews, mandatory participation in parenting classes) that seek to “reform” homeless mothers. To gain a better understanding of perceptions of and responses to shelter regulations, we interviewed 28 formerly unhoused US mothers about their experiences in family shelters. Participants overwhelmingly rejected “bad mother” stereotypes that equated lack of material resources with inadequate parenting and engaged in a range of overt (e.g. strategic recounting of life histories) and covert (e.g. subverting paternalistic rules) strategies to reclaim “good motherhood” and negotiate daily shelter life. Instrumental, discursive, covert, and overt critical resistance strategies were used to maintain parental authority, preserve one’s self-image as a “good” mother and obtain needed resources from shelter staff. Our findings highlight the complexity of critical resistance to class, race, and gender oppression and call for greater interrogation of how seemingly well-intentioned shelter rules and policies reinforce status hierarchies.",

      "title": "Anthropologie Et Psychodynamique Du Deuil",
      "abstract": "For centuries the excessive reactions of mentally ill subjects to the death of one parent have been noticed. Bowlby (3, 4) was struck by the similarity of these reactions to those of young children separated from their mother. According to him, the child reacts first by a vehement protest, expressed in many-different forms (confusion, negation, efforts to recover the lost one, crying, rage against her, self-mutilation and introjection). The following phase is that of despair, manifested by apathy, disorganization of behaviour, loss of appetite, solitary rumination and isolation. At last, the third phase is the one of gradual detachment from the mother, followed by a reattachment to the surrounding persons and to the mother-substitute. This behaviour sequence of the young child following the mother's departure is hypothetically considered here as the prototypical sequence of mourning behaviour in adults (following the final departure of a parent), not only in our western culture, but in all human societies. A brief investigation is made to verify the presence throughout the world of institutionalized funeral rituals similar to the many separation reactions of the young child. Phase one: Protest As an example of negation of death, one has the mummification used by the Egyptians to prevent the putrefaction of the corpse, or the belief (48) in the reincarnation of the dead one in a grandchild. As equivalent to efforts to recover the mother, one has the custom in Trobriand (50) to visit the Island of the Dead and to talk with them. The practice of crying is ritualized in many societies, for example the ‘paid’ weepers. Rage against the dead one is expressed among the Kurnai (30) through violent protest, or through aggressive behaviour against the corpse (63). Self mutilation among the bereaved, through guilt, has been observed with the Hottentots (11), where the relatives have to cut off their little finger to be placed with the body in the grave. Introjection of the dead one is facilitated among the Armas (61) by the custom of putting on the deceased's clothes or, in Melanesia (51), by the ritual of piously eating the deceased's flesh, sarco-cannibalism. Phase two: Despair Not only do most societies allow the bereaved to abandon themselves to grief by temporarily excusing them from their social duties, but often they prescribe precise behaviours, as in Bengal (64), the prohibition against washing, shaving and combing one's hair, or among the Warramunga (80), the custom for the widow to keep silent for years. Phase three: Detachment Detachment is favoured in many societies through the beliefs in integration of the deceased into another world (41) through rituals forbidding the dead ones to come back among the living (28), or through preventing them from doing so by building symbolic barriers around the house (55), or in Africa leaving wooden monuments to the dead to rot (34), or putting into the coffin all their belongings (73). Finally, many ceremonies are provided to reintegrate the bereaved into society after a certain period of time, through banquets (93), steps to facilitate the remarriage of the widowed (85), etc. In conclusion, it is confirmed that the spontaneous, purely psychological reactions of the young child following separation from his mother, although sometimes strange and unexpected, have been found institutionalized, that is imposed as normal in many human societies. Then contrary to what Durkheim had thought, there is not a chasm between psychology and socio-anthropology, but a differential continuity in the sense that each society chooses, among the large field of possible behaviours of the child to separation, a few of them which it prefers, and institutionalizes them as rituals to be followed by the community. The following stage of this study would be to investigate the causes of these choices, for example why certain societies dramatize mourning so much, whereas others try to minimize it.",

Almost no research has explored how FTD is experienced by the whole family. We aimed to develop a detailed understanding of inter-generational family experience of bvFTD over time. We took a social constructionist approach based on interviews with seven families, including the person with bvFTD at up to 3 time points every 6–9 months. Families faced four major challenges: The whole family was challenged around developing awareness and understanding of the changes, and managing everyday life. Those directly living with bvFTD wrestled with maintaining their identity, and those closely involved in care struggled with changes in their relationship. Families’ coping lay on a continuum from adjustment through to being stuck, with this influenced by connectedness prior to bvFTD, individual ways of coping, the ongoing changes, and the context of family life over time.",

      "abstract": "Reciprocity – the capacity to engage in social exchange that integrates inputs from multiple partners into a unified social event – is a cornerstone of adaptive social life that is learned within dyad-specific attachments during an early period of neuroplasticity. Yet, very little research traced the expression of children's reciprocity with their mother and father in relation to long-term outcomes. Guided by evolutionary models, we followed mothers, fathers, and their firstborn child longitudinally and observed mother–child and father–child reciprocity in infancy, preschool, and adolescence. In preschool, children's social competence, aggression, and prosocial behavior were observed at kindergarten. In adolescence, children's dialogical skills were assessed during positive and conflict interactions with same-sex best friends. Father–child and mother–child reciprocity were individually stable, inter-related at each stage, and consisted of distinct behavioral components. Structural equation modeling indicated that early maternal and paternal reciprocity were each uniquely predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschool, which, in turn, shaped dialogical skills in adolescence. Father–adolescent reciprocity contributed to the dialogical negotiation of conflict, whereas mother–adolescent reciprocity predicted adolescents' dialogical skills during positive exchanges. Results highlight the role of parent–child reciprocity in shaping children's social collaboration and intimate relationships with non-kin members of their social world.",

Parenting styles (e.g., democratic versus authoritarian) and parenting practices (e.g., inductive discipline versus guilt-shame induction) in particular have been empirically linked to prosocial behaviors as well as numerous other well-being indicators in children. What is less understood is the role that culture and cultural context might play in the parenting-prosocial nexus. This chapter explores the contributions of culture comparative and in-depth cultural studies of parenting and children’s prosocial behaviors. These studies extend the range of variability of parenting dimensions and contexts as they relate to children’s prosocial outcomes – providing a means of testing the generalizability of theory in a wider range of settings, as well as in identifying facets of parenting and family life that may otherwise be neglected in current scholarship. Collectively, studies support traditional socialization theories and show how numerous parenting dimensions are linked to prosocial outcomes in children in several cultural communities. Nonetheless, emerging research suggests culturally embedded processes that impact upon the parenting and prosocial link - meriting closer attention for future scholarship.",

For this study, the qualitative study with depth interview was conducted with 8 multi-cultural families(e.g. husband, wife, child and elderly parent). The depth interview contents were marriage process, family relation or family interactions, social adaptation process, and social services needs. Results showed the followings: First, multi-cultural families had multiple distressors so that these distressors made multi-cultural families vulnerable to family crisis. Second, Hill's ABCX model explained the process of family distress to family crisis in the multi-cultural families in that they had few resources(both individual resources and family resources) and even worse they had negative cognitions about their own multi-cultural family systems. This situation made them difficult to solve their problems and to cope with their distressors. Third, major distressors in multi-cultural families were founded in this study. These were different cultural gap, communication difficulties, social discrimination to multi-cultural families, and lack of social support networks. Discussion will address suggestions about effective family policies for multi-cultural families in order to make them resilient to family crisis and help to well-adjusted in the korean society.",

Not only are most of us inclined to give special treatment to our parents, we also tend to think that our giving them such treatment is a matter of duty. We show special concern for our parents not only because we want to, but also because we think it would be wrong to do otherwise. A grown child who fails to look after his parents, when his parents have been perfectly loving and have given him a perfectly good upbringing, and when they have needs he is perfectly able to meet, is a person who fails in his moral duty.",

      "abstract": "Summary One important aspect of the family literature has been the relationship between parental marital status and various facets of children's psychological and social lives. Yet, this research too often has been carried out on clinical samples of parents and/or children. Moreover, the emphasis has been either on widowed or on divorced families. In contrast, the present study focused on perceptions of their fathers and mothers by a representative sample (N = 4539) of all Montreal Francophone teenagers in school. We found that adolescents perceived their separated or divorced fathers the most negatively, their widowed or still-married fathers the most positively. Perceptions of mothers differed little by parental marital status and the trends indicated a least favorable perception of widowed mothers, followed by separated mothers, and, most favorably, of mothers in legally intact families.",

Bangkalan Madura Penelitian ini dilakukan di desa Dumajah Kec. Tanah Merah Kah. Bangkalan Madura, dengan menggunakan metode penelitian kualitatif. Teknik pengumpulan data menggunakan wawancara tak berstruktur, observasi, dan dokumentasi. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa adanya dinamika psikologis yang dirasakan oleh remaja putri yang melakukan pernikahan dini. Adapun dinamika psikologisnya meliputi: 1. Statusnya yang berbeda dengan remaja pada umumnya dan hal tersebut membuat mereka akan merasa malu berada bersama orang lain dan mereka pada akhirnya menutup diri dan tidak mau bergaul lagi dengan teman­ teman sebayanya yang belum menikah. 2. Remaja putri yang telah menikah akan dihadapkan pada keluarga baru yang memiliki peraturan berbeda dengan yang ada pada keluarga kandungnya dan jika ada sedikit peraturan yang tidak disetujui oleh dirinya maka ia akan merasa tertekan dan melampiaskan dengan berdiam diri atau lari pulang kerumah orangtua kandung mereka. 3. Remaja putri yang telah menikah mengalami sebuah perubahan dalam pola hidupnya yang berbeda dengan ketika ia belwn menikah seperti ketiga subyek mereka merasa kurang percaya diri dan meajadi tertutup pada orang lain. 4. Kehidupannya hanya dihabiskan dengan hal-hal yang tidak seharusnya ia lakukan pada masa usia mereka misalnya hamil, merawat anaknya, melayani suami yang membuat seirang remaja putri tidak memiliki waktu untuk berprestasi lagi seperti dulu. 5. Pola pikir remaja yang telah menikah menjadi kurang maju dan mereka selalu berpikiran jika semua yang mereka alami saat ini adalah suratan takdir yang harus ia jalani dan hal itu membuat remaja meajadi tidak mampu berpikiran untuk maju. Bagi peneliti selanjutnya unruk mendapatkan hasil yang maksimal diharapkan dapat meningkatkan kualitas dengan memperhatikan variabel yang dapat berkaitan dengan dinamika psikologis.",

      "abstract": "There is a provable correlation between the housing conditions of elderly persons and their being attached to a network of aid they can rely on in cases of emergency and strain. The elderly living in one or two-family houses, for example, have several options of being supported. The elderly living in big city tenements on the other hand often lack such an abundance of relations. Integration into the circle of family members and relatives plays the major role for these quantitative framework conditions as well as for the immediate availability of assistance. Having a house of one's own increases the possibility of developing a well-functioning cross-generation support system within the family. If promotion of house construction was further adapted to this operating mechanism, support effects for social policy could be reached. At the same time it is imperative to encourage the development of informal support systems within the framework of socio-political initiatives. With the number of childless elderly persons increasing, such systems would partially compensate for the lack of family assistance through neighbourhood and other forms of self-support.",

      "title": "Grandparents Raising Grandchildren: The Role of Commitment",
      "abstract": "The number of grandparents assuming the primary caretaker role for their grandchildren in Western industrialised countries has rapidly increased in recent times. Despite the increasing prevalence rate of grandparent-headed households in Australia, little is known about the characteristics and experiences of these families. Custodial grandparents face a number of stressors as a result of raising their grandchildren. These stressors have negative implications for grandparents’ mental health. Many children being raised by grandparents have encountered a number of negative life events prior to residing with their grandparents. These adverse experiences place grandchildren at a greater risk for social, emotional, and behavioural problems. A caregiver’s level of commitment to their relationship with a child has important implications on the caregiver’s experience as a carer as well as child developmental outcomes. There has been extensive research on the impact of caregiver commitment in the area of foster care families. However, there is a gap in the literature in relation to commitment amongst grandparents raising grandchildren. There are two main research aims for the present research: 1) develop a coding system to measure commitment amongst grandparent caregivers, and 2) examine the relationship between grandparent commitment, grandparent mental health, and the social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties among grandchildren. The following thesis, which is comprised of two studies, used archival data to examine the research aims. Study One involved the development of the Grandparent Commitment Coding System, which was adapted from a measure of commitment commonly used in the foster care literature. Qualitative responses from 183 grandparent caregivers were scored by two independent raters using the Grandparent Commitment Coding System. The scale was found to have good internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .77. Study Two examined the relationships between grandparent commitment, grandparent mental health, and child social, emotional, and behavioural difficulties. It was hypothesised that grandparent commitment would moderate the relationship between grandparent psychological distress and child difficulties. It was also hypothesised that high social support and low life stressors would mediate the impact that grandparent’ psychological distress has on child difficulties. The study sample consisted of the same 183 participants from Study One. Self-report measures were administered to obtain information on the mental health of grandparents, perceived social support for grandparents, major life stressors, and child adjustment. Grandparent commitment scores obtained from Study One were used in Study Two. As predicted, results indicated a significant positive relationship between grandparent psychological distress and child difficulties. Grandparent psychological distress was also significantly associated with grandparent commitment. Contrary to expectations, grandparent commitment did not appear to moderate the impact of grandparent psychological distress on child outcomes. High social support and low life stressors were not found to mediate the impact that grandparent’ psychological distress has on child outcomes. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are highlighted.",

      "title": "Promoting Permanency and Human Rights",
      "abstract": "An increasing number of children are being cared for exclusively by grandparents or extended family. The majority of these caregivers are raising children outside of the foster care system without a formal legal status. In fact, kinship diversion, placing children whose parents cannot or will not care for them with family or friends outside of the foster care system, is encouraged by state and federal law. Informal kinship caregivers face many obstacles to providing care for children and they are more likely to be unemployed, receive government benefits, and be less educated, as compared with parents raising their own children. In addition, the majority of these caregivers live in poverty, and few receive adequate subsidies or other support for the children in their care. When an informal kinship caregiver living in poverty wishes to move for permanency, through adoption or permanent guardianship proceedings, the out-of-pocket expenses are an obstacle — the costs of a private adoption or permanent guardianship proceeding top $3,000, not including attorney’s fees. While adoptions and permanent guardianships are at least partially subsidized when the children are in foster care, the subsidies for these legal proceedings for informal kinship caregivers living in poverty are inadequate in many states. In those states, informal kinship caregivers living in poverty who wish to move for permanency for the children in their care are barred from doing so for lack of funds. Using a human rights lens to analyze the applicable law, regulations, and practices of all fifty states and the federal government, this article argues for the subsidization of private adoptions and permanent guardianships for kinship caregivers living in poverty.",

Auch wenn jeder Fall individuell ist, zeigen sich beim Studium verschiedener Fallgeschichten gewisse gemeinsame Nenner, die auch am Fallbeispiel dieses Beitrags erkennbar werden. Zu Beginn der Lebensgeschichte steht nicht selten ein Scheitern des Containments; entweder wegen einer missgluckten Mutter-Kind-Beziehung oder weil Traumata - etwa abrupte Beziehungsabbruche - bereits gelungene Weiterentwicklungen zerstort haben. Die depressive Position wird nicht erreicht, Gefuhle werden nicht ausreichend symbolisierungsfahig und weiterhin in Gestalt von Affektmotilitat abgefuhrt. Es wurde kein haltgebender Container verinnerlicht, die Stimulation des Korpers wird zum Mutterersatz. Oft fallt die triangulierende Funktion des Vaters aus. Der Junge - und es sind fast immer Jungen - bleibt in einer fatalen Beziehung mit der Mutter verklebt, ohne ein vaterliches Gesetz zu verinnerlichen. Die inzestuose Nahe sexualisiert, andererseits schurt sie auch destruktive Aggression, sodass der Junge in einer sado-masochistischen Beziehung gefangen bleibt und sich von der Mutter kaum losen kann. Verschwindet der Vater, lost der Junge den odipalen Konflikt scheinbar, indem er sich selbst an die Stelle des Vaters setzt. Zu Beginn des Beitrags werden einige Widerspruche - vor dem Hintergrund von Forschungen zur Neuroplastizitat - innerhalb der Hypothesen uber die Entstehung einer ADHS diskutiert.",

Bu durumun yaşanmasında ise eşitsiz koşullarda yaşayan kadınların göç ile birlikte daha eşitsiz koşullara boyun eğmek zorunda kalması etkili olmaktadır. Güncel göç literatüründe de çoğunlukla erkeği birincil ve özne konumunda görürken kadını ise onunla hareket etmek zorunda olan bir eşya gibi ikincil konumda görmektedir. Bu ilişkilendirmenin aksine göç sürecinde kadınlar değişen sosyo-ekonomik ve kültürel yapının da etkisiyle değişimde aktif özne olmuştur dolayısıyla toplumsal cinsiyet rolleri de bu değişimden bağımsız değildir. Rolleri gereği süreci göçün feminizasyonuna dönüştürmüştür. Daha çok bireysel ya da psikolojik sorunların çözümlenmesi veya davranışın iyileştirilmesi anlamlarını içeren baş etme, ilerleyen zamanlarda bireysel/psikolojik sorunlar kadar, aile, aile içi ya da aileler arası ilişkilerini, grup veya toplulukların eylemlerini de kapsar hale gelmiştir. Baş etme daha çok, bireyin ya da grubun (ailenin) karşılaştıkları sorunu veya engeli ortadan kaldırıcı araçlar bulma çabası, sahip olduğu imkân ve kaynakları seferber etmesi olarak tanımlanmaya başlanmıştır; bu çalışmada da göçmen kadınlar özelinde kullanılan baş etme benzer süreçleri ve anlamları içermektedir.

It is self-evident that children living in birth families always have some key relationships that have been created biologically. But as a result of the high rate of divorce, separation, and re-constituted families, a significant proportion of children and young people in our society are also living with one parent and with siblings to whom they are not related biologically. There have been a number of important recent studies, which have clarified the current state of child mental health in Great Britain, in both the general population and in looked-after children and young people. Children adopted in infancy and not subject to neglect and abuse have only moderately increased, if any, rates of difficulties in comparison to children raised by birth families.",

Working hours usually are rigidly set and must be strictly observed. The workplace is often far from where the baby is kept. The tasks to be completed and the general work environment are such that a baby’s presence would be disruptive if not dangerous. Any regular, frequent aspect of childcare — such as breastfeeding — is simply not possible during working hours when mother and infant lack easy access to one another. Even the passage of legislation based on the International Labor Organization Maternal Protection Convention Number 3, which prescribes breastfeeding breaks in the working day (Richardson, 1975), does not necessarily guarantee employers’ compliance or alert women to their rights. Furthermore, the problem of providing a desirable environment for the baby in a convenient location for the rest of the working hours is rarely addressed.",

Based on interviews with 27 middle-aged gay men, I argue that two major shifts occur in midlife away from the family of origin and the commercial scene of Manchester’s ‘gay village’ towards ‘friendship family.’ The latter encourages mobilization of ‘ageing capital’ that helps subjects withstand/contest homophobia and gay ageism. Subjects used ageing capital to question heteronormative notions of family and practice non-monogamy. However, men’s stories of homes/ neighbourhoods combine belonging and alienation (Cook, 2011). Whilst experiences of homes/ neighbourhoods were generally affirmative, some informants experienced exclusion from friendship family for socio-economic and cultural reasons which render the home a site of ambivalence, exclusion and risk.

      "abstract": "Many negative images are evident in the mass media concerning deficiencies in family support for the aged. Most of these are not substantial by contemporary research, but dramatic social changes have occurred which have implications for the family context of older people. While increases in life expectancy result in greater numbers of grandparents and great-grandparents than ever before, lower fertility places a greater burden on fewer lineal descendents for their care. Most older people prefer to remain independent from children whenever possible; at the same time, patterns of visiting, exchange of assistance, support, and inter-generational agreement appear high. Practitioners working with families should point out that norms appropriate to earlier historical periods may have changed; in particular, idealized images of family life in the mythical past are dysfunctional-both to the parent-caring middle-aged and to the professional.",

Using grounded theory approach, the themes for a good death were (a) dying peacefully; (b) not suffering; (c) experiencing spiritual connection; and (d) making amends with significant others. Themes for a bad death were (a) experiencing death by accident or violence; (b) prolonging life with life supports; (c) becoming dependent while entering a dying trajectory; and (d) dying alone.

In addition to this, an individual has to face deteriorating health condition due to age related biological decline. This brings about a limitation in carrying on their social and family roles. The aged in these circumstances have to face a number of conflicting situations with which they find difficult to cope. The paper looks into their living arrangements, their self-reported problems and their activity status. It also tries to assess the availability of care provider and fulfilment of expectations by their children. Family type is changing and as such the elderly have to at times deal with their declining abilities by themselves. Children provide care to their ageing parents but the satisfaction level is found to be lower than expected.",

Yet, studies on cues to word meaning primarily rely on structured tasks, where distractors are few compared to the countless objects that vie for attention in the home environment. Forty mothers and their 13‐month‐old infants were video‐recorded during home routines. From transcripts, 3,000+ “naming events” were coded for social (visual and manual) and contextual (location: room and place) cues to the object of reference. Mother and infant visual and tactile attention accompanied naming events with high regularity, and the objects mothers named were specific to room and place. Nested social and contextual cues infuse infants’ everyday language experiences in ways that help infants disambiguate word meaning.",

      "abstract": "A decreasing birthrate, rising numbers of women pursuing careers, work pressures, tensions between parents and children, and a weakening in traditional filial piety mores have changed Taiwanese society in recent years. Such changes may result in poorer levels of family care. The personal ideas of children regarding filial piety determine their future willingness to take care of elderly parents. Recently, concepts associated with filial piety have shifted from a focus on authoritative filial piety to one on reciprocal filial piety. Thus, good or poor interactions between parents and children will impact on the willingness of children to take care of their parents. When children show a reduced level of filial piety than expected, they lower their parents' hopes, which may cause uncertainty and a fear of abandonment among elderly family members. Moreover, such may also give rise to abuse from family caregivers. Therefore, those involved in the care of the elderly should evaluate the relationship between a family and its elderly members and, if the family needs more care support, resources should be provided. The result will be better overall, more holistic care of the elderly. In the future, a study in the community that examines the relationship between children's concepts of filial piety and family care of the elderly is suggested. The results of such may be used in education.",

Despite increases in rates of GV children and their families presenting at clinics, there is little research on how raising a GV child affects the family as a whole or how families make decisions regarding their care. This study took an ecological‐transactional framework to explore the question, “what is the experience of parents who raise a GV or transgender child?” Eight mothers and three fathers of GV male and female children (ages 5–13) referred through a GV support group participated in interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using an adaptation of grounded theory analysis. These parents attempted to pave the way to a nonstigmatized childhood for their GV child, typically through two pathways: rescuing the child from fear of stigma and hurt or accepting GV and advocating for a more tolerant world. Many participants used both pathways to different degrees or shifted paths over time, and the paths selected were related to parents' own understanding of GV and their experiences and backgrounds as well as characteristics of the children they were parenting and the communities they inhabited. Limitations, clinical implications, and future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "When infants die suddenly and unexpectedly, family structures are abruptly altered. This loss and its subsequent changes affect remaining older siblings. New \"big brother\" and \"big sister\" roles are suddenly terminated, often in a catastrophic manner. Young surviving children are sometimes unable to understand the meaning of this event, its impact on the family, and their own role in what has occurred. In this study, 26 families that had sustained the sudden and unexpected death of an infant and that had surviving children were interviewed to obtain data about surviving siblings at least 10 months following the loss. Among the 26 families, there were 35 surviving siblings (ages 16 months to 6 years). The interview schedule sought information relevant to changes in patterns of sleep, toilet training, feeding habits, peer relationships, and parent-child interaction. Among these 35 surviving siblings, parents of 28 siblings (80%) perceived changes in their child's interaction with them, 24 siblings (69%) demonstrated changes in sleep patterns following the baby's death, and 13 siblings (37%) showed changes in social interaction. Regression in toilet training and changes in feeding patterns were infrequent and not areas of major concern for parents. These behavioral changes reflected both a continuum of adjustment by the child and a persistence of parental worries.",

The death had a major impact on the surviving siblings of all ages, and commonly resulted in difficulties in coping. Feelings of guilt, anger, anxiety and sadness frequently led to behavioural and physical symptoms; but some children without major symptoms were also felt to have significant psychological and emotional difficulties. Explanations given to many of the children were confusing and inadequate, and often aggravated these feelings. Competent counselling should be offered to all families, including those without surviving children, to assist the family in making a satisfactory adjustment. Mourning should be accepted as a healthy part of living, and is important for further psychological growth in the family.",

Louisiana administrative professionals serve as catalysts in developing rehabilitative services for the long-term mentally ill by involving families and friends, who assume a leadership role. This departs from the former approach, which excluded families completely because care-providers were concerned about a potential conflict of interest or a noxious influence on the patient. Theories of causation or faulty communication patterns have now been disproved. The present approach differs also from the comparatively new, supportive counseling.

Rivalry may be manifested as a verbal or physical attack, frustration, persistent demands for attention, or as regressive phenomena. When handled properly, healthy competition among siblings will lead to the acquisition of social, interpersonal and cognitive skills that are important to the development of the child. Mismanagement of the competition may lead to psychological problems later in life. The appropriate spacing of children and the preparation of existing children for a new sibling help to reduce sibling rivalry. Family situations that will potentially lead to jealousy should be avoided. Parents should not make comparisons between siblings and favoritism should be avoided. When episodes of sibling rivalry develop, the cause rather than the manifestation of the rivalry should be treated. Patience, love, understanding, common sense, and humor are important parental skills necessary to minimize sibling rivalry.",

Those who are practically engaged in family care have been discussing for some time whether successful integration is effected by \"good host families\" or by the special constellation that develops between the host family and the guest. The present article tries to emphasise (following a review of the literature) on the basis of a discontinued family care episode that integration into a host family is not a static affair but a highly sensitive process determined by the biography of the guest and the integration between host family and guest (or guests).

Selective matching (assortative matching) occurs when individuals are matched based on a series of characteristics: Positive Assortative Matching if they are common, such as the same level of education, and Negative Assortative Matching in case a match is preferred with totally different characteristics.",

Common treatment alternatives for families facing divorce could include (1) no formal treatment, (2) marital therapy with discussion about the children, (3) family treatment with both ex-spouses and the children, or (4) therapy with the children and only one parent on issues that parent has with the children. In single-parent families, the therapist's job is to help the parent form a functioning support system. In binuclear families the central issue involves the multiple systems in which the children must operate. Couples in blended families need specific types of interventions such as validating their feelings, and normalizing stepfamily dynamics and issues.",

As the youngster grows, however, she becomes increasingly independent. This shift has been documented for Soay sheep living on the Scottish island of St. Kilda (Clutton-Brock et al., 2004). They are free-ranging and thought to be intermediate in type between wild sheep and domestic sheep; the latter have had their social instincts bred out of them to some extent so that they will perceive a shepherd as their leader rather than an elderly ewe (Darling, 1969). Although they seldom interact with their mother, Soay juvenile and yearling daughters usually graze within 20 meters (22 yd) of her as their mutual bond weakens (Clutton-Brock et al., 2004). (The bond between mother and son dissolves much faster, with the lamb on his own by six months of age.) By the time the daughter is about two years old, this friendship is gone, too. She is no more likely to associate with her mother than with any other female in their group. From a human point of view, it is nice to know that the mother likely will, by that time, have another young offspring at heel.",

En medio de estos cambios, los adolescentes tienen que lograr desarrollar conductas que les permitan adaptarse a los diferentes ambientes en los que se desenvuelven y sentirse satisfechos al lograr tambien ajustar su propio comportamiento a lo que ellos necesitan. \r\nPor lo tanto se pretende establecer los niveles de adaptacion, en las principales areas de la vida social, la relacion de los adolescentes con sus grupos, en general, su percepcion de la realidad social. Se trabajo con los 35 adolescentes del Albergue Villa Juvenil del Sistema Integral de la Familia del Estado de Mexico, que es la poblacion total de jovenes que conforman dicha institucion. Se ha tenido en cuenta un conjunto de variables sociales y se utilizo el Cuestionario de Adaptacion para el Adolescente de H. M. Bell, para medir los niveles de adaptacion de indole personal y social.",

      "abstract": "The author explores the practices through which migrant domestic workers established Transnational Voluntary Kin relations with individuals who are non-blood or law-related. Transnational Voluntary Kin are intimate relationships, which alleviate migrants' reproductive needs by replacing, overlapping or complementing traditional family support. Drawing from Braithwaite, Bach, Baxter, Hosek, & Wolf [(2010). Constructing family: A typology of Voluntary Kin. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 27(3), 388–407] four relationships are explored. Firstly, there are 'More than family' Kin that replace the care of absent or dead family members. Secondly, there are 'Just like Family' Kin that replace the care of physically proximate relatives unable to perform their roles. Thirdly, there are 'Whenever needed it' Kin that replace or overlap traditional kin aid in particular situations. Fourthly, there are 'In law or extended' Kin constructed through the marriage of traditional kin. Data are drawn from a multi-sited ethnography with Peruvian-Colombian migrant domestic workers and their Transnational Voluntary or Traditional kin. The analysis contributes both to the constructivist sociology of the family and transnational family studies where these relationships remain underexplored.",

There have been relatively few studies exploring the experience of spouses who have placed a partner in care. Due to a lack of preparation, the placement process is often ad hoc, with little attention being given to spouses' emotional reactions or their efforts to maintain their relationship with their partner. The relationship between care home staff and families is often superficial and strained. There is a need for more proactive efforts to facilitate a partnership between care home staff and families.",

      "abstract": "Infants begin to help other individuals in the second year of life. However, it is still unclear whether early helping behavior is based on an understanding of other individuals’ needs and is thus motivated prosocially. In the present eye-tracking study, 9- to 18-month-old infants ( N = 71) saw a character in need of help, unable to reach its goal because of an obstacle, and a second character that was able to achieve a goal on its own. When a third individual (a helper) initiated an action, the infants expected the helper to help the character in need (as indicated during the anticipatory-looking and violation-of-expectation phases). Their prosocial understanding did not differ between age groups and was not related to their helping behavior (measured in two behavioral tasks). Thus, infants understand other individuals’ needs even before they start to help others themselves. This indicates that early helping may indeed be motivated prosocially and raises the question of which other competences underlie the ontogeny of helping behavior.",

      "abstract": "Latar Belakang : Peningkatan usia harapan hidup disatu pihak menjadi indikatorkemajuan suatu bangsa, tetapi dipihak lain akan banyak menimbulkan masalahterutama masalah fisik, mental, ekonomi dan psikososial sehingga dapat menimbulkan persoalan bagi lansia itu sendiri, keluarga, maupun pemerintah. Bagi lansia, hal-hal tersebut dapat mempengaruhi kehidupan mereka diantaranya, kesepian, terasing dari lingkungan, ketidakberdayaan, perasaan tidak berguna, ketergantungan, kurang percaya diri dan keterlantaran terutama bagi lansia yang miskin. Persoalan tersebut bersumber dari menurunnya fungsi fisik dan psikis akibat proses penuaan (Suardirman, 2011). Persoalan-persoalan diatas rawan terjadi pada lansia, karena ketidaksiapan mereka menerima apa yang telah terjadi sehingga dapat merugikan diri dan orang-orang di sekelilingnya. Lansia akan mengalamipenurunan fungsi kognitif dan psikomotor. Fungsi kognitif meliputi proses belajar,persepsi, pemahaman, pengertian, perhatian dan lain-lain sehingga menyebabkanreaksi dan perilaku lansia menjadi lambat. Sementara fungsi psikomotorik (konatif)meliputi hal-hal yang berhubungan dengan dorongan kehendak seperti gerakan,tindakan, koordinasi, yang berakibat bahwa lansia menjadi kurang cekatan. Penurunan kedua fungsi tersebut, akan menimbulkan perubahan aspek psikososial yang berkaitan dengan kepribadian lansia, termasuk kematangan emosi. Perubahan perubahan tersebut juga akan berdampak pada kualitas hidup lansia (Kartinah dan Agus, S, 2008).Tujuan: Mengetahui hubungan antara kematangan emosi dengan kualitas hidup lansia di dusun Salam kecamatan Pathuk Gunung Kidul.Metode Penelitian: Penelitian ini menggunakan metode analitik observasional dengan pendekatan cross sectional. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh lansia yang ada di dusun Salam kecamatan Pathuk I Gunung Kidul, sejumlah 56 orang..Pemilihan sampel secara total sampling. Data dianalisis menggunakan Spearman Rank dengan derajat kepercayaan 95% (α=0,5).Hasil Penelitian: Kematangan emosi lansia dusun Salam sebagian besar berada pada kategori sedang (94,6%), dan kualitas hidup sebagian besar di kategori cukup (62,5%). Uji Spearman Rank didapat hasil koefisien korelasi Kematangan Hidup sebesar -0.078 (&lt;0,005), maka Kematangan Emosi tidak berhubungan dengan Kualitas Hidup lansia.Kesimpulan: Kematangan Emosi tidak berhubungan dengan Kualitas Hidup lansia. Hasil uji korelasi didapat nilai negatif (-0,078), yang artinya kekuatan hubungan ke dua variabel sangat lemah dan tidak searah.",

Generally they turn first to other family members or to close friends, seeking either confirmation of their worries or reassurance that there is nothing basically wrong and no cause for concern. When convinced that some help is needed, they may then turn to a trusted individual such as their clergyman, family practitioner, or paediatrician. Because these individuals already know the family and have an ongoing rapport with them, they are in many ways more able to establish quickly a working relationship that can be used to help solve the problems. However, because of the social aspect of the relationship the family has with the person to whom they turn for help, they may withhold certain very personal and emotionally charged but rather important information out of a sense of reticence or embarrassment. Thus the personal relationship, while facilitating the early contacts, may impede the investigation and examination of more intimate areas.",

Methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive and correlative design. Eighty-four next of kin answered two questionnaires: the Caregiver Burden Scale and the Subjective Quality of Life. Results: Next of kin experienced a high burden in their life situation although they, at the same time, experienced a good quality of life. In the results gender differences were found. Females next of kin to a higher extent were disappointed, more emotionally involved, and they also estimated their economic situation as more unsatisfactory than the males next of kin. Conclusion: Healthcare personnel meet next of kin, persons in need of care, within all healthcare and social care in society. Therefore it is important to have a general knowledge and ability to understand the next of kin’s life situation, thus making it possible to focus the nursing interventions on individual support regardless of the care receiver’s diagnosis.",

The term “caregiver” has been used to refer to individuals who provide direct or indirect physical assistance, financial aid, or emotional support to adult family members or friends who have physical, cognitive, or emotional disabilities. Existing research indicates that employed caregivers experience emotional and financial strain, as well as salutary consequences, as a result of their adult-care responsibilities. Working caregivers, like working parents, are faced with the challenge of combining potentially competing family-care and job responsibilities, frequently making substantial accommodations in one or both of these roles.",

      "abstract": "O envelhecimento caracteriza-se como um processo heterogêneo, com mudanças físicas e biológicas, bem como abrange inúmeras possibilidades e desafios a serem enfrentados nos âmbitos social, econômico, cultural e familiar. A doença de Alzheimer (DA) apresenta-se com uma prevalência crescente no quadro de doenças demenciais, correspondendo até 50-70% dos casos. O quadro demencial torna-se mais grave conforme a progressão dos sintomas manifestados pela deterioração cognitiva, de memória, alterações comportamentais, dificuldade na realização das atividades de vida diária (AVDs) e sintomas neuropsiquiátricos. A intensa necessidade de acompanhamento pode caracterizar a DA como uma doença familiar, uma vez que o adoecimento do idoso causa um impacto muito significativo na dinâmica da família. O papel exercido pelo cuidador do idoso com Alzheimer é caracterizado como um trabalho de intensa sobrecarga e precedente para o aparecimento de doenças psicológicas, devido aos sérios fatores estressantes oriundos das exigências dos cuidados integrais. O relato de caso é de caráter qualitativo, realizado por meio da coleta de dados via narrativa da família estudada, em visitas domiciliares por 4 meses. A análise dos dados incluiu a observação direta da dinâmica familiar no contexto da Doença de Alzheimer e a análise dos depoimentos dos membros da família e cuidadores, respeitando a privacidade dos indivíduos. M.C., 86 anos de idade, foi diagnosticada com Doença de Alzheimer há 3 anos. A piora do quadro de demência levou a uma grave desnutrição e desidratação, fato que culminou em dificuldade de fala, de deambulação, comportamento agressivo, além de tornar-se cada vez mais dependente. Sua vestimenta, higiene, alimentação e bem estar passaram a ser algumas das preocupações constantes de V.S., nora e cuidadora em tempo integral, a qual passou desenvolver níveis de estresse e ansiedade. A idosa em estágio avançado de Alzheimer, apresentava sintomas típicos da doença como perda progressiva da memória, afasia, apraxia, crises de agressividade, agitação psicomotora, alterações cognitivas e comportamentais severas. O processo de adaptação dessa doença degenerativa ocorre de forma gradual e particular, uma vez que requer uma reestruturação e modificação dos papéis no conjunto: novos horários, atividades, cuidados, diferentes redes de relacionamentos, interações e tomadas de decisões. Nesse contexto, cada indivíduo da família apresenta influência para a manutenção da harmonia das relações. Os cuidadores de pacientes com demência possuem maiores chances de ter sintomas psiquiátricos, conflitos familiares e problemas no trabalho. Este grupo demonstra um pior julgamento sobre a própria saúde e sentem-se mais aflitos com sua vida afetiva e social. Pode-se concluir que o impacto de uma enfermidade crônica e neurodegenerativa, como a doença de Alzheimer, inclui mudanças não apenas na vida do doente, mas também na de sua família. Além da grande dificuldade emocional em vivenciar essa doença no núcleo familiar, existe a necessidade de reestruturação de rotinas e hábitos, que por vezes culmina na sobrecarga de atividades para o cuidador, o qual fica exposto a fatores estressores intensos.",

      "title": "Аdapting to a New Reality: A Review of International Studies on the Developmental Specificities of Children Deprived of Parental Care in Substitute Families and Through Adoption",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;This article analyzes the challenges encountered during the adoption of children or their placement in substitute families across various countries, with a focus on their adaptation, psychosocial development, cognitive abilities, and social integration. To achieve the objectives of this research, the scope was not limited to adopted children but extended to children deprived of parental care who were placed in alternative forms of family care (substitute families&amp;mdash;such as guardianship families, including foster families). Foreign researchers differentiate between foster children: &amp;ldquo;substitute family&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; raised in a foster or substitute family, &amp;ldquo;adopted children&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; adopted, &amp;ldquo;looked after children&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; under guardianship, &amp;ldquo;foster families&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; temporary stay in families, (an analogue is the system of state care in Russia), who are waiting for a suitable family for upbringing and long-term residence. The possibility of studying this category of children is associated with the practice of open adoption prevalent in most countries. In contrast, the secrecy of adoption in Russia impedes the ability to track the developmental dynamics of children, particularly those adopted at an early age. The study examines key factors influencing the well-being of adopted children and children under kinship guardianship, including the impact of cultural differences, models of adoption (open and closed), early traumatic experiences, and the level of support provided to foster families. Special attention is paid to medical aspects, academic performance, psychological issues, and potential behavioral deviations. An analysis of international data identifies the primary challenges faced by adopted children, such as legal troubles, emotional instability, and difficulties in social integration. It is revealed that the source of psychological trauma in most cases lies in the pre-adoption period of the child's life, which often includes factors collectively referred to as adverse childhood experiences. Parental attention and warmth in relationships can significantly mitigate the challenges faced by children. The article underscores the importance of an interdisciplinary approach, including collaboration between government institutions, NGOs, and educational organizations, to minimize the negative effects of adverse childhood experiences and improve the quality of life for children.&lt;/p&gt;",

The physical changes of puberty are generally seen as the starting point of adolescence, while the end is less clearly delineated. Adolescence ends with attainment of ‘full maturity’, and a range of social and cultural influences, including the legal age of majority, may influence this. In developed societies, these tend to delay progression to adulthood. The extension of compulsory schooling and development of further education, with its economic consequences, generally contribute to a delay in reaching full independence. This may, in turn, lead to difficulties in adjusting to the responsibilities of the next stage of life.",

Hybrid multilevel models are used to analyze the change in parent–adult child contact over two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. Changes in parent–child proximity, parent and child marital status, and child parental status are associated with change in contact; continued coresidence with another adult child is related to contact with non-coresidential children; but change in parent health does not affect contact. Some patterns are stronger for daughters and biological children who tend to have stronger relationships with their parents. These analyses demonstrate how life-course transitions of parents and adult children can be examined in family context to understand how changes in the life of one family member may influence relations with another.",

      "title": "Young Adults’ Provision of Support to Middle-Aged Parents",
      "abstract": "Middle-aged adults often provide support to aging parents, but researchers know little about support that young adults provide middle-aged parents. This study examined support that young adults provide parents and explanations for that support from both offspring's and parents' perspectives. Young adults (n = 515, mean age = 22.34) and their parents (n = 364, mean age = 50.09) from the Family Exchanges Study reported support that offspring provide parents. Participants also reported parental personal problems, parental disability status, relationship quality, and support that parents provide offspring. Offspring provided parents with emotional support and listening more often than other forms of support. Offspring reported providing more frequent support than parents reported receiving. We examined factors associated with support using multilevel models. Both offspring and parents reported more frequent support provided to parents when they had higher quality relationships and when parents gave more frequent support to offspring. Offspring (but not parents) reported providing more frequent support to parents when parents were disabled. Findings are consistent with solidarity theory, which suggests that high-quality relationships may explain support. The concept of self-enhancement and generativity in middle-aged parents may explain the intergenerational differences in the association between parental disability and support.",

      "abstract": "When studying a child’s ability to form an attachment to a parent it has become clear that the caregiving style shown by the person giving it plays a crutial role. Four standard descriptions of such caregiving styles (secure, disorganized, anxious and avoidant) has made it possible to investigate whether the relationship between child and caregiver could be reflected by their attachment style and caregiving style, since the child’s proximity seeking behaviour to its caregiver varies depending on the caregiver’s ability to dispaly a safe haven for the child. One way to study this safe haven effect is to create different forms of challenging scenarios, as that of separation and reunion. Investigating proximity seeking behaviour towards different persons associated with the four caregiving styles upon reunion has been the angle of this study, but from the owner-dog-perspective. Overall, the dogs intiated more physical contact with the person displaying secure caregiving style compared to the disorganized one, and again more with secure than with avoidant. However, it is speculated whether personality could be a contributing factor, where some individuals prefer a certain caregiving style to match its own personality and previous experience. In this case more fearful dogs initiated less physical contact with the person with an anxious caregiving style while dogs that where more aggressive towards other animals preferred the company of the anxious one. Further studies could therefore make great use of continued application of personality as a contributing factor when it comes to human-dog-interactions. (Less)",

This phenomenon has increased a lot in recent years due to migrations, wars and increased skewed urbanization. There are familial and socioeconomic factors that push children to live on the streets. Depending on various factors such as domestic violence and problems child abuse and neglect, the child can be pushed into the street. Migration, skewed urbanization, squatting, unemployment and poverty are the socioeconomic factors that push children to live on the streets. Although there are social and cultural differences between the many streets where children live, poverty, violence and exploitation are common connections. Children living on the streets grow away from family environment, attention, appreciation, love, care and protection. In addition, living on the street puts them at risk and dangers. They can experience various physical, social and mental problems depending on the dangers and risks they face. The majority of these children encounter substance and alcohol use / addiction, lack of education, malnutrition, sexually transmitted diseases, vehicle accidents, street fights, physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Nurses have important responsibilities in protecting, maintaining and improving the health of children living on the street.

      "abstract": "The transition from adolescence to adulthood is commonly accompanied by major changes in relationships between parents and their children. Surprisingly little is known about this process, and in particular parents' perspectives of it. This article explores parents' views of their parenting roles at this life stage and the types of support they provide to their sons and daughters. Using data from the Australian Temperament Project - a large longitudinal study of children's development that commenced in 1983 and has collected 14 waves of data over the first 24 years of life - this article examines how parents with children aged in their mid-20s perceive their parenting roles; the levels of financial and emotional support they provide; and whether parents' perceptions and support differ for young men and women and according to their adult child's place of residence (in the family home or elsewhere). The findings suggest that most parents continue to have a close involvement in their children's lives. There were few gender differences, but numerous differences according to whether or not young people were still living at home. Overall, a shift in parents' perceptions of their roles seems to be occurring, with many moving away from providing practical, tangible support to a more advisory and guiding role.",

      "abstract": "Borderline adolescents from wealthy families pose a number of special problems in psychotherapy. The family may use great affluence to cushion the lives of their children in such a way as to diminish motivation for work, avocational pursuits, or anything requiring self-discipline. This in turn may exacerbate problems in the formation of identity, already impaired in the borderline adolescent. Antisocial tendencies may go unchecked because of the wealthy family's unusual ability to get around the authorities whenever its children are apprehended for an offense. Appropriate limit setting, imposed in ordinary families partly out of economic necessity, may fail to be imposed where family wealth has nullified the necessity for it. Parental deprivation, encountered often among the very poor, may also be seen among the wealthy, some of whom insulate themselves against their children to a marked degree, via household servants to whom almost all parental functions may have been allocated. From such deprivation, various character deformations may develop, including pathological narcissism. Clinical vignettes, illustrating these points and containing some suggestions for therapy, have been included.",

The results of macro-level changes have received little focused attention in the aging literature, where much of the caregiving research has addressed issues within the context of traditional family structure. Yet the conventional nuclear family model is increasingly uncommon as new, pluralistic models of family life are emerging in contemporary society. The majority of elder care is provided by relatives, albeit with varying patterns of involvement and responsibility across family structures. Both conventional and pluralistic families face challenges in meeting the care needs of their oldest members, leaving some older adults at risk of having unmet needs. Additional research on family risk and resilience related to the care of older relatives is warranted, particularly with respect to pluralistic models of family life.",

There are numerous risk factors that lead to suicidal behavior and therefore prevention activities are necessary, mostly in primary health care, continuous education in schools, families, and media.

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context and relevance.&lt;/strong&gt; The issue of selecting parents for adopted children remains an important aspect of social policy and child development psychology. Biological and social factors significantly influence the formation of maternal behavior. Among biological foundations are processes such as imprinting, attachment, hormonal changes during pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation, along with individual character traits and cognitive abilities of mothers. However, it is precisely the social conditions that allow a child to absorb the norms and values of a particular society. The aim of this study was to identify differences between biological mothers and two categories of substitute mothers &amp;mdash; those who raise only adopted children and those who combine raising both their own and adopted children. &lt;strong&gt;Objective.&lt;/strong&gt; To investigate the peculiarities of parental competency formation among different groups of mothers and determine the impact of biological and social factors on the effectiveness of fostering adopted children. &lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness of parenting of adopted children is related to the presence of native children of substitute mothers and their biological and sociodemographic characteristics. &lt;strong&gt;Methods and materials.&lt;/strong&gt; The research involved a sample of 109 mothers, including 52 substitute mothers and 57 biological mothers. There were significant age variations: substitute mothers had an average age of about 47 years compared to biological mothers at approximately 37 years old. Substitute mothers exhibited lower levels of education, more children, and higher rates of being unmarried. Participants underwent testing focused on working memory capacity, inhibition mechanisms, and temperament characteristics. &lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt; Analysis revealed that mothers raising birth children demonstrated greater working memory volume and better learning capabilities when compared to substitute mothers. The most pronounced deficit in sensory sensitivity was observed among mothers simultaneously raising both birth and adopted children, suggesting a heightened risk of emotional burnout within this group. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusions. &lt;/strong&gt;These findings highlight the importance of considering individual motherly characteristics when selecting candidates for adoption and emphasize the need for support programs aimed at preventing professional burnout syndrome among couples engaged in combined parenting of birth and adopted children.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Parenting behaviors, such as the provisioning of food by parents to offspring, are known to be highly responsive to changes in environment. However, we currently know little about how such flexibility affects the ways in which parenting is adapted and evolves in response to environmental variation. This is because few studies quantify how individuals vary in their response to changing environments, especially social environments created by other individuals with which parents interact. Social environmental factors differ from nonsocial factors, such as food availability, because parents and offspring both contribute and respond to the social environment they experience. This interdependence leads to the coevolution of flexible behaviors involved in parenting, which could, paradoxically, constrain the ability of individuals to rapidly adapt to changes in their nonsocial environment.",

      "title": "Prison Visitation",
      "abstract": "As rates of incarceration in the United States increased to the level termed “mass imprisonment,” interest in the broader consequences of correctional involvement also grew. Researchers and policymakers expanded their attention beyond the individual in prison or jail, to examine the lives of those connected to the incarcerated individual, such as family members and friends. Family life is affected in myriad ways when a member is incarcerated. A family may experience the loss of income, parents’ contact with children is restricted, and adult partners’ lives are altered. The incarcerated individual’s parents and broader systems of kin and friendship networks are also impacted by a family members’ incarceration. One important means of staying connected to a person in a correctional institution is prison visitation. Studies indicate that visitation is the least frequent form of contact between the incarcerated and outsiders (phone calls and the exchange of letters is more common), but visitation is nonetheless a significant aspect of incarceration. Visitation is a unique experience for family members in that they are free people who enter correctional facilities and must then abide by institutional rules. At the same time that family members enter institutions to visit, for the incarcerated individual, visitation provides important opportunities to interact with the outside world and maintain familial bonds. There is commonly held wisdom that correctional officials value visitation as a programmatic offering that occupies inmates’ time and provides opportunities for pro-social interactions. Visitation can, however, present challenges, as contact with outsiders may be an avenue for securing contraband. Visitation encounters are tightly regulated, with institutions arguing the rules are necessary for the safety and security of the institution, and some family members experiencing the restrictions as unnecessarily repressive. Published research about prison visitation has developed significantly over the last several decades. The earliest research, linking visitation to inmate outcomes such as institutional behavior and recidivism after release, suffered methodological limitations by not controlling for the factors that could influence both the likelihood of receiving visits from family members and these outcomes. As the research has advanced, the methodological rigor of studies has improved, as well as work applying a range of methodological approaches. Current research examines the experiences of family members (including children) visiting within institutions, inmate experiences of visitation and outcomes during and after release, and visitation modalities such as conjugal and video visitation. Scholars continue mapping out an agenda for future research and policy questions. Topics of particular importance include how to facilitate visitation access for families, making visitation spaces more welcoming and comfortable for family members and children, and using visitation during the incarceration period to facilitate reentry and reintegration into the family and community upon release.",

Due to developmental acceleration, sociological shift in terms of undertaken roles and realized developmental tasks as well as their moratoriumlinked delays, it is also the time conducive to educational activity. This psychological time of a young person, its course and specificity depend, to a large extent, on numerous (micro-, mezo- and macro-) conditions of family life and social life in today’s world which is more competitive and less predictable than it used to be for generation of the late 1990s. All of these factors contribute to the fact that maturing to adulthood seems to be a state which is harder to achieve nowadays. It is displayed in the form of delaying the moment of taking up a job or other important decisions in family and relationship contexts.The study aims to present the selected aspects of daily life of disabled young adults, described in the context of developmental tasks of this period and considering the perspective of investment in relationships, development of one’s own resources, pursuing education and entering the job market which are all, from a temporal perspective, a chance of complementing one’s own identity.",

Los ancianos validos al ingreso en un centro dejan de realizar tareas por un mecanismo de ajuste de su conducta a la vez que pueden adoptar una actitud pasiva; efecto generador de dependencia. Todos los ancianos al ingresar por primera vez en un centro geriatrico se someteran a un periodo de adaptacion y observacion establecido en 20 dias tras el cual sera valorado por una comision tecnica. En un estudio anteriormente realizado en la misma poblacion se pudo constatar, refiriendonos a la capacidad funcional traducida en AVD e AIVD y a la percepcion de la salud de los residentes, durante los primeros 20 dias de ingreso (periodo de adaptacion), que los resultados muestran la existencia de una relacion significativa entre la autonomia e independencia de un anciano y su deterioro debido a la institucionalizacion, a la vez se deduce que los mayores durante dicho periodo de adaptacion no sufren cambios significativos en su percepcion de salud por el hecho de la institucionalizacion, si bien es cierto que dicho periodo es solo de 20 dias segun la Legislacion sobre Servicios Sociales en Andalucia y no hay tiempo suficiente para evidenciar los cambios. Al creer necesario un seguimiento mas a largo plazo, se pretende hacer una segunda valoracion de los aspectos anteriormente mencionados y medidos tras pasar un periodo lo suficientemente amplio (ano y medio) como para poder constatar si persiste o no el deterioro en la autonomia e independencia de los mayores para la realizacion de actividades de la vida diaria e instrumentales, asi como si se mantiene su percepcion de salud. OBJETIVO: Evaluar la influencia que ejerce la institucionalizacion en la autonomia de un anciano en el momento de su ingreso en una residencia geriatrica de validos y compararlo con el obtenido tras ano y medio de institucionalizacion. METODO: Diseno preexperimental con estudio pretest-postest de un solo grupo en dos momentos diferentes, es decir, medicion previa y posterior a una intervencion, que en este caso seria el tiempo. Variables dependientes: Grado de Autonomia: Medir la capacidad del anciano/a referente a actividades cotidianas mediante el Indice de Barthel, Actividades Basicas de la Vida Diaria (ABVD) y el de Lawton, Actividades Instrumentales de la Vida Diaria (AIVD). Variable Independiente: Ingreso del anciano/a en la Institucion. Es la variable que pueda modificar o no su grado de autonomia. Variables sociodemograficas: Edad, sexo, procedencia, estado civil, capacidad adquisitiva, motivo de ingreso. CONCLUSIONES: Dentro de una institucion el programa de adaptacion del anciano deberia tener como prioridad la adaptacion organizativa del centro a las verdaderas necesidades de los usuarios, no al reves, implicando en este proceso siempre a la familia? todo en pro de fomentar en todo momento la autonomia tanto fisica como psicologica del anciano.",

Vor allem wirken neben okonomischen Verschlechterungen, Veranderungen im sozialen Umfeld und neuen, in dieser Form oft nicht antizipierten Anforderungen an Selbstandigkeit und eigene Entscheidungsfahigkeit sowie zwischen den ehemaligen Partnern die ungeklarten Ehekonflikte mit den hier erfahrenen Enttauschungen und Krankungen nach.

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;La incidencia del fenómeno de la violencia filio-parental parece estar aumentando. Se ha utilizado un diseño descriptivo y transversal. La recogida de datos se ha realizado con encuestas, tests psicológicos y cuestionarios, aplicados a padres, menores, educadores de servicios sociales y profesionales de Salud Mental Infanto-Juvenil de Zaragoza y Huesca, España. Los principales resultados encontrados son: los menores agresores son varones adolescentes; la madre es la persona más agredida; existen más casos de familias con niveles socioeconómicos bajos; la adopción puede ser un elemento característico de estas familias, pero no, la separación de los padres; estos adolescentes presentan problemas escolares y trastorno de hiperactividad con déficit de atención, asimismo consumen drogas; la violencia de género y el maltrato infantil están presentes. Además, se ha comprobado que se aplican diferentes medidas rehabilitadoras siendo el modelo de psicoterapia más utilizado el sistémico familiar y parece elevado el número de menores con tratamiento farmacológico. Los hallazgos obtenidos servirán de guía para orientar la intervención y ajustar los servicios a las necesidades de estos menores y de sus familias.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Socialization and Feminism",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the meanings of monopolization for the role of socializer, ie., child carer and also primary or nurturant socializer in the modern family, especially mothers.In modern societies, 1) the socialization process has become more discontinuous than in that of pre-modern societies. Children have their socialization experience not in the whole societies in which they live, but in their own famillies that are formed as isolated socialization systems. 2) The mother has held the monopoly for the role of parenting. Societies have lost the mechanism of multiple parenting and also the device of social uncle. 3) Anticipatory socialization has become the main process as opposed to participatory socialization. 4) In modern societies, the purpose of socialization is for mobility, ie., upward mobility in social stratification; anticipatory socialization is suitable for mobile societies. In other words, socialization is used not for ascription, but for achievement.As a whole, we can say that modern societies have lost their manifest function of socialization, although they have important latent or implicit effects upon socialization. Now, in contemporary societies changing toward the post-modern era, societies require us to construct a new socialization system to build a new manifest function of socialization, not monopolized by the family or by mothers, but taken by multiple socializers in broader societies as a socialization system.",

      "abstract": "This study employed mother–child playgroups as a context for examining mothers' supervision of child–peer interactions and children's adaptation to a new peer‐group setting. Six playgroups, consisting of quartets of mothers and their 24‐ to 54‐month‐old children (n = 23), were observed in ten 90‐minute sessions. All mothers attended the first two days of playgroup; only two mothers were present on each of the remaining days, rotating supervision responsibilities. Ratings were made of mothers' behaviour toward their own and others' children and children's behaviour toward the mothers and peers. Children were oriented mainly toward their own mothers on the first two days of playgroup, but became increasingly involved in cooperative and parallel play with peers over time. Children were more likely to be involved in peer‐oriented play when their own mothers were present, and children of mothers who were judged to be more skilful supervisors were less likely to engage in solitary play. These findings converge with other evidence in supporting the usefulness of playgroup experiences for scaffolding children's early peer interactions and for facilitating children's transition between home and more formal educational settings such as preschools and daycare.",

Crimes of sexual violence against children are an example of the vulnerability of a child's position, especially for sexual purposes. The image of a child who has been placed as a sexual object has far-reaching implications for a child's life, so she must always face violence, coercion, and physical and psychological violence. Children have basic human rights, like adults, protection of children's rights is not many people come to think and do concrete steps. Therefore, an attempt to protect the rights of children violated by adults, families, and their own environment, even bias so its own parents (adoptive parents / stepparents) and neglect of parents who are less supervising the baby, resulting in an undesirable thing. Criminality is all forms of speech, behavior and behavior that harm society and attack the safety of citizens, both those covered by law and those not yet covered by the criminal law.

Relationships with invisible companions were mostly described as sociable and friendly, whereas personified objects were usually nurtured. Mothers reported that personification of objects frequently occurred as a result of acquiring a toy, whereas invisible friends were often viewed as fulfilling a need for a relationship. Compared to children without imaginary companions, children with imaginary companions were more likely to be firstborn and only children.",

      "title": "Where’s my daddy gone?",
      "abstract": "SynopsisAn escalating divorce rate in Western society has caused all who work with children to look carefully at the impact marriage breakdown has upon families. When parents separate, unquestionably children will suffer, although intrafamilial disagreements may reach such a pitch that dissolution of the marriage represents a relief of tension, if nothing else. Additional to the central issue of divorce are many problems which have serious impact upon the emotional development of the child. These include arrangements relating to custody and access, economic difficulties often resulting in a mother’s unwilling return to the workforce, the splitting up of families and not uncommonly an introduction to stepparents and their issue. Children may blame themselves for the divorce, project blame on to the parent who leaves, or on to the one who remains for letting the other go. Long-term sequelae to parent divorce may be shown by persistent hostility to parent figures (expressed by aggressive and antisocial behaviour), delinquency, depressive symptoms and underachievement at school. Since it seems unlikely that the number of divorces affecting children will diminish in the future, it behoves all professionals involved with divorcees and their children to look to ways of helping both child and family during the process of divorce and subsequently, of educating those who make legal decisions relating to divorce and the parents themselves about the emotional needs of children when family breakdown occurs. It is suggested that the children of de facto relationships should be given the benefits of the Family Court.",

      "title": "Family violence and COVID‐19: Increased vulnerability and reduced options for support",
      "abstract": "Family violence refers to threatening or other violent behaviours within families that may be physical, sexual, psychological, or economic, and can include child abuse and intimate partner violence (Peterman et al. 2020, van Gelder et al. 2020). Family violence during pandemics is associated with a range of factors including economic stress, disaster-related instability, increased exposure to exploitative relationships, and reduced options for support (Peterman et al. 2020). Due to the social isolation measures implemented across the globe to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, people living in volatile situations of family violence are restricted to their homes. Social isolation exacerbates personal and collective vulnerabilities while limiting accessible and familiar support options (van Gelder et al. 2020). In many countries, including Australia, we have already seen an increase in demand for domestic violence services and reports of increased risk for children not attending schools (Duncan, 2020), a pattern similar to previous episodes of social isolation associated with epidemics and pandemics (Boddy, Young & O'Leary 2020). In Australia, as stay-at-home orders came into force, the police in some parts of the country reported a 40% drop in crime overall, but a 5% increase in domestic abuse call-outs (Kagi 2020). At the same time in Australia, Google reported a 75% increase in Internet searches relating to support for domestic abuse (Poate 2020). This pattern is repeated internationally. Reports of domestic abuse and family violence have increased around the world since social isolation and quarantine measures came into force. Recently, anecdotal evidence from the United States, China, Brazil, and Australia indicates increases in intimate partner, women, and children violence due to isolation and quarantine (Campbell 2020; Peterman et al. 2020; van Gelder et al. 2020). China, the first country to impose mass quarantine in the Wuhan province, saw reported domestic abuse incidents rise threefold in February 2020 compared to the previous year (Allen-Ebrahimian 2020). As Europe imposed quarantine measures in an effort to slow the tide of infection, the Italian government began commissioning hotels to provide shelter to the increasing number of people fleeing abusive situations (Davies & Batha 2020). Similarly, France reported a 32% - 36% increase in domestic abuse complaints following the implementation of self-isolation and quarantine measures (Reuters News Agency 2020). France also began commissioning hotels as shelters for those fleeing abuse. As quarantine measures extended to the United States, individual states reported similar increases in domestic abuse incidents ranging from 21% to 35% (Wagers 2020). Back in Europe, the UK has also seen concerns about increase in family violence (Bradbury-Jones & Isham 2020). There have been reports of homicide associated with family violence in several countries (Bradbury-Jones & Isham 2020; Reuters News Agency 2020). The National Domestic Abuse Hotline in the UK saw a 25% increase in calls since stay-at-home measures were implemented (Kelly & Morgan 2020), recording at least eight family violence-related deaths (Knowles 2020). As the novel coronavirus outbreak has intensified globally, countries are adopting dedicated measures to slow the spread of the virus through mitigation and containment (van Gelder et al. 2020; Campbell 2020). Social distancing and isolation are central to the public health strategy adopted by many countries, and in many settings, penalties are in place for any person who breaches these imposed restrictions. Social isolation requires families to remain in their homes resulting in intense and unrelieved contact as well as the depletion of existing support networks, such as through extended family as well as through social or community-based support networks for families at risk. Additionally, isolation places children at greater risk of neglect as well as physical, emotional, sexual, and domestic abuse (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [NSPCC] 2020). Due to (necessary) imposed social distancing and isolation strategies, and the resulting shortages of essential resources and economic consequences of these measures, people globally are living under stressful conditions. While social isolation is an effective measure of infection control, it can lead to significant social, economic, and psychological consequences, which can be the catalyst for stress that can lead to violence. Isolation paired with psychological and economic stressors accompanying the pandemic as well as potential increases in negative coping mechanisms (e.g. excessive alcohol consumption) can come together in a perfect storm to trigger an unprecedented wave of family violence (van Gelder et al. 2020). In Australia, as social distancing measures came into place, alcohol good sales rose more than 36% (Commonwealth Bank Group 2020), and as restaurants, bars, and pubs closed, people are now drinking more within the confines of their homes. Unemployment figures around the world have rapidly risen into the double digits, with millions signing up for welfare payments and a worldwide recession predicted in the near future (Kennedy 2020). Substance misuse, financial strain, and isolation are all well-known domestic abuse risk factors (Richards 2009). During isolation, there are also fewer opportunities for people living with family violence to call for help. Isolation also helps to keep the abuse hidden with physical or emotional signs of family violence and abuse less visible to others (Stark 2009). Reports show that COVID-19 is used as a coercive control mechanism whereby perpetrators exert further control in an abusive relationship, specifically in the use of containment, fear, and threat of contagion as a mechanism of abuse. In Australia, charities providing support to people experiencing domestic abuse have highlighted concerns specifically related to reports from people whose intimate partners are using COVID-19 as a form of abuse. There have been reports of misinformation used by intimate partners related to the extent of quarantine measures (Gearin & Knight 2020) and other forms of COVID-19-related abuse (Fielding 2020). Further, there are reports that those experiencing domestic abuse may be afraid to go to hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19 (Fielding 2020). We recognize that these are challenging times for all of us, but especially for the most vulnerable families and children. The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently called for countries to prioritize support and set up emergency warning systems for people living with family violence (News Wires 2020). Pharmacies and grocery stores in France are now providing emergency warning systems to help enable people to indicate that they are in danger and need support (Guenfound 2020), through the introduction of code words to alert staff they need help (Davies & Batha 2020). Domestic abuse support agencies in some areas have published specific guidance on domestic abuse in COVID-19 focussing on what friends and family can do to support people who are isolated (Domestic Violence Resource Centre Australia [DVRCA] 2020). Charities are also recognizing the role that neighbours can play in supporting people living with family violence, providing advice on what to listen for and look for while they themselves are home, and encouraging conversation with neighbours (Gerster 2020). The fear and uncertainty associated with pandemics provide an enabling environment that may exacerbate or spark diverse forms of violence. Actions such as social distancing, sheltering in place, restricted travel, and closures of key community resources are likely to dramatically increase the risk of family violence (Campbell, 2020). Governments and policymakers must create awareness about an increased risk of violence during pandemics and highlight the need for people to keep in touch with each other (while observing precautionary measures) and the great importance of reporting any concerns of abuse. It is important to remember that maintaining social connectedness is an important strategy during times of isolation (Usher et al. 2020), even more so with family or friends you suspect may be at risk of family violence. In addition, information about services available locally (e.g. hotlines, tele-health, respite services, shelters, rape crisis centres, and counselling) must be made known to the general public through a range of sources, including social media, the mainstream media, and health facilities. Mental health professionals can support people by providing first-line psychological support, including listening empathetically and without judgment, enquiring about needs and concerns, validating peoples' experiences and feelings, enhancing safety, and connecting people to relevant support services (WHO 2020).",

En el medio familiar, la información sobre SIDA, son temas menos hablados por los padres, probable serias por tiempo, por comunicación, por falta de información que ni ellos la tienen. La variable sexual activa un porcentaje importante dice haber iniciado la vida sexual, pero un porcentaje mayor no lo ha hecho, probablemente tengan miedo de cómo evitar un embarazo no deseado, o no tienen novio (a), puede ser por los aspectos sociales como la familia. En cuanto a la variable edad de inicio de la vida sexual según sexo, los varones suelen iniciar su vida sexual activa, antes que las mujeres, pero ambos en menor o mayor medida están expuestos a los riesgos que implican llevar una sexualidad sin cuidos. Los adolescentes tienen su primera relación sexual a edades cada vez menores, y si bien físicamente están absolutamente preparados mentalmente, no siempre están listos para lidiar con las consecuencias y las responsabilidades que eso genera. La variable cantidad de personas con quien ha tenido relaciones sexuales según sexo, el sexo femenino es el que representa menor el porcentaje en cuanto número de personas que han tenido relaciones sexuales, esto probablemente se cuidan de su salud, adquieren conciencia acerca de las responsabilidades de tener hijos, en cambio en el sexo masculino el porcentaje es un poco mayor debido al libertinaje que tiene el varón y además el varón dice que no ha tenido relaciones con más personas, apenas un 6% dice si haber tenido relaciones con máspersonas.En relación a las variables has consumido alcohol, droga en la última relación sexual, usaste condón en la última relación sexual, que método usaron para evitar embarazo en la última relación sexual, los adolescentes de Juigalpa consumen muy poca droga para las relaciones sexuales, esto quiere decir que la mayoría de ellos están conscientes de las cosas que hacen, los adolescentes estudiados la gran mayoría utilizan condón es sus relaciones sexuales, esto quiere decir que se protegen de embarazo no deseados y de algunas enfermedades de transmisión sexual, el condón es el que prevalece en las relacionessexuales, los adolescentes están seguros que el condón es para evitar embarazo. En la variable te han dicho alguna vez un médico o enfermera que tenías enfermedad de transmisión sexual, la prevalencia de ambos sexos es baja, esto quiere decir que los adolescentes estudiados se chequean a menudo, de 340 adolescentes u solo 10 adolescentes refieren haber tenido enfermedad de transmisión sexual, en cuanto a los adolescentes que tienen vida sexual activa es muy baja la prevalencia de infecciones de transmisión sexual, de 102 adolescentes con vida sexual, refirió 7 adolescentes haber tenido enfermedad de transmisión sexual.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS OF SPORTS AND NON-SPORTS YOUNG ADOLESCENTS",
      "abstract": "From school onwards, children spend more and more time with their peers without direct adult supervision. In peer groups, the emphasis is on shared interests, understanding and trust, rather than joint activities. The biological changes associated with adolescent sexual maturation also lead to changes in social relationships. The topic is particularly topical now, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, when opportunities for face-to- face communication have been significantly reduced, leading in many cases to a transformation of relationships. &#x0D; Playing sport expands the individual's range of experience: he or she is exposed to a new social environment, has the opportunity to form new relationships, and encounters a new set of values and norms. All this shapes their personality, their individuality and has an impact on their whole life. However, many children today do not play sport regularly, partly because of the increased mental workload and demands and the resulting lack of time. In my research, I was looking for answers to the question of how regular sporting activities affect the social relationships of young adolescents. As the data from my research show, regular sporting activity has a beneficial effect on both the extension and the intensity of children's relational networks, especially for those playing team sports.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adoption policy in the UK emphasizes its role in providing secure, permanent relationships to children in care who are unable to live with their birth families. Adoptive parents are crucial in providing this life‐long, stable experience of family for these vulnerable children. This paper explores the experience of adoptive parenthood in the context of changes to adoptive kinship relationships brought about by new, unplanned contact with birth family during their child's middle adolescence. This contact was initiated via informal social networks and/or social media, with older birth siblings instrumental in negotiating renewed relationships. The contact precipitated a transition in adoptive family life resulting in emotional challenges and changes in parent/child relationships, which were experienced as additional to the normative transitions expected during adolescence. Parental concern as a dominant theme was founded in the child and birth sibling's stage of adolescence, coupled with constraints on adoptive parenthood imposed by the use of social media, by perceived professional attitudes and by parental social cognitions about the importance of birth ties. Adoptive parents' accounts are interpreted with reference to family life‐cycle theory and implications are suggested for professional support of adoptive kinship relationships.",

      "title": "Managing Family Relations and Controlling Information While Supporting an Allergic Child",
      "abstract": "This paper explores parental (particularly mothers’) support in the daily lives of children with allergies in a Swedish context. An ordinary life is established by making comparisons to what other children without allergies presumably can do (and eat). Although the parents’ goal is to support their child in managing allergies, neither their practical nor their interactional strategies work in a clear-cut direction to promote the child’s ordinary life and identity. On the contrary, parents’ accounts convey that they function just as much against an everyday life and the child’s identity. When managing family relations, parents expect immediate family members (specifically grandparents) to understand and accommodate the child’s needs. However, claims of family responsibility are made through moral tales about lack of support from “generalized others.” Family responsibility is also downplayed in parents’ accounts as demands of support may put parents’ moral self at risk. The strategy of information control in certain situations and (non-family) relations used to keep the child safe may risk stigmatizing the child, alternatively, making the child into a social threat. One of the conclusions that could be drawn from this study is that claims of family support may be contradictory to other cultural principles that ascribe responsibilities between families and individuals, as the principles of individual freedom and autonomy.",

      "abstract": "The outcomes for children in kinship care are generally seen as positive in terms of identity formation, stability of placement, behavioural and mental health outcomes, enabling siblings to live together and child protection. However, there is some disquiet about the length of time children stay with relatives; agencies are not sure about how best to position themselves in relation to the families, or how best to conduct home studies and license relative carers. There is evidence that relatives receive both less support and supervision from agencies than do traditional foster parents. This paper examines the benefits and challenges of relative care, whilst identifying current research limitations, and focuses on the gaps in respect to the intersection between research policy and practice. Through this examination, considerations are given to such issues as: What service delivery models are needed to optimise potential benefits through aligning law, policy and practice guidance? How, and to what extent, should relative care be financed? Where does relative care fit with the intersection of permanency adoption and guardianship? The ambiguity that exists towards this care option needs exploration, as does the question of how a worker's own \"family experiences and values\" may influence, or be influenced in, the course of the relative-care work.",

However, neglect is often difficult to assess for two reasons: firstly it often resembles poverty; and secondly, neglecting families tend to have disorganised patterns of accessing health care and social support. This article looks at the importance of joint health and welfare input in interventions with families at risk of neglecting their children. The Strengthening Families Program at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital provides a model for interdisciplinary and intersectoral (welfare and health) collaboration, which offers care management to individual families and is working towards systemic changes in the hospital's response to these families.",

Although neonates cannot live without the resources provided by their mother, they are not simply passive recipients of maternal care. Beginning shortly after birth, mammalian young exhibit species-typical behaviors that contribute to their own wellbeing. Mothers in particular are highly sensitive to signals that communicate the physiological and motivational state of their infants. For example, when removed from their nest, mouse and rat pups emit ultrasonic \"distress\" cries that attract their mother and thereby enable her to retrieve them (Allin and Banks, 1972; Noirot, 1966; Zippelius and Schleidt, 1956). Isolated lambs bleat, similarily facilitating parent-offspring reunion and nursing (Walser et al., 1984). In a reciprocal manner, adults communicate via various sensory modalities with their newborns, who, in turn, display overt responses to their parents (or cues that they produce) that are critical for survival.",

The sample included 26 participants. Open-ended interviews were conducted. The interview transcripts were submitted to content analysis. The main findings suggest that caregivers who experience family integrity tend to embrace the new life demand associated with the caregiving role, while those tending towards disconnection struggle to maintain their pre-existing goals, and those experiencing alienation tend to feel helpless. Caring for a relative with dementia has an impact on multiple aspects of family life.",

      "title": "LESSON LEARNT IN INJURY CONTROL: AFTER 30 YEARS WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY?",
      "abstract": "Our current view of injury prevention is shallow, narrow and unfocused. We may need to re-examine our approach to injury control to include a more holistic approach that is essentially based on the social determinants of health. Injuries do not happen in isolation. Like the layers of an onion, it is a combination of interplay between various pathophysiologic pathways; constitutional factors; individual risk factors and choices; social relationships; living conditions; neighbourhoods and communities; institutions and finally social and economic policies that contribute to injury causation. From the moment we are conceived and especially up to the age of 18 months our nurturing impacts us for the rest of our lives. We have a choice to invest the time and resources when the infant's brain is most malleable or by default continue to spend too late and at a greater cost in social services, welfare, judicial systems and health care expenditures. Without a doubt, our chances of achieving greater health are directly linked to the strengthening of the social determinants of health: genetics, gender, housing, education (literacy), income and social status, personal health practices, resilience, nutrition, employment conditions, physical environment, culture, child development, spirituality and strong social support networks. Our inability to acknowledge the importance of ‘love’ and ‘happiness’ in our lives makes the required new thinking of injuries difficult for the majority of injury prevention leaders. The current desire for instant versus delayed gratification in our society directly leads to the need for an expensive, ineffective health care system. The very actions that give us instant gratificat ion also give rise to disease and injury. Fatty foods give rise to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and injury. Drug use gives rise to overdoses, addictions, mental illness, crime and injuries. Alcohol use gives rise to cirrhosis, mental illness, violence, injuries and crime. Inactivity gives rise to obesity, poor health, and disability. Salt use gives rise to hypertension and cardiovascular problems. Sex gives rise to sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, fetal alcohol syndrome and sexual assaults. Smoking gives rise to cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis and injuries. It is estimated that 50% of all deaths in developed countries are preventable. That for those under the age of 44, injury is the leading cause of death. For those under the age of 34 motor vehicle related injuries are the leading cause of death. And finally, injuries kill more 1–19-year-olds than all other diseases combined. Let us broaden our approach to injury prevention by boldly linking our discussions to include ‘love’, ‘happiness’, ‘instant versus delayed gratification’ and the ‘social determinants of health’ as we search for solutions to this seemingly elusive problem—injuries.",

      "abstract": "Parental failure to adequately care for or supervise a child has recently come under scrutiny both in criminal and civil jurisdictions. While it was once thought that parents enjoyed a form of immunity from tortious liability in negligence for failing to adequately supervise their children, recent cases have highlighted the difficulty in distinguishing between commissions or positive acts (for which a parent may be liable) and omissions to act (where liability is more contentious). Parent’s and guardians also face the prospect criminal sanctions in circumstances where their failure to adequately care for or supervise a child results in harm to the child. There are a limited number of long standing authorities where a parent or guardian had been convicted following an extended period of neglect resulting in serious harm or even death to a child. It is not until recently however that the courts have considered the criminal responsibility of parent’s for momentary lapses of care resulting in less serious harm. These cases raise interesting questions as to the circumstances under which the responsibility for care of a child can be transferred from one carer to another and the extent to which an accused's status as a parent or guardian can be taken into consideration in determining whether criminal negligence has been established. \r\n\r\nThis paper considers the various criminal offences that may arise from failure to adequately care for or supervise a child, the distinctions between criminal and civil liability in negligence, how it relates to a parent’s moral duty to care for their child and questions whether the law is moving towards too great a burden on the supervising parent.",

      "abstract": "Domestic violence is a large social issue in today's contemporary setting, which may include but not limited to, sibling abuse, elder abuse, spouse abuse, and child abuse. Domestic violence has many names; family violence, wife or child beating, and domestic abuse. Spouse abuse talks about abuse from a marital or a dating partner in an intimate relationship. Domestic violence is merely not just physical, but is any behavior that is intended to control another person through the use of verbal assaults. Children exposed from any form of violence at home have higher risks of alcohol/drugs abuse, post-traumatic stress director, and juvenile delinquency and adult criminality. Family feuds or conflicts oftentimes happen in the eyes of the members of the family. It may either be in the form of shouting, physical or verbal violence and in some cases the mother or the father is forced to leave the house in order to subdue the conflict to avoid further heated arguments or worst, physical fight. Witnessing can mean seeing actual incidents of physical, verbal and or sexual abuse. It can mean hearing threats or fighting noises from another room. Children may also observe the aftermath of physical abuse such as blood, bruises, tears, torn clothing and broken items. Also, children may become aware of the tension in the home such as their mother's fearfulness when the father-abuser's car pulls into the driveway. This undertaking aims to determine the effects of domestic violence on children especially on their socio-educational behaviour. Specifically, it looks into the profile of the children-respondents and the effects of domestic violence to their socio-educational behaviour. This study utilizes the descriptive research design which focuses only in describing the effects of domestic violence on children-respondents. Purposive sampling is utilized in identifying the subjects of the study which covers only children who had witnessed domestic violence at home were taken as samples. An interview schedule and a structured questionnaire were also used in gathering the data. These were pre-tested at Maraburab, a barangay in Alcala, Cagayan and validated before these were finally administered to the respondents. It was discovered in this particular study, that the children are disturbed in their studies resulting to poor performance and lack of concentration in their class. Children who experienced domestic violence internalize the incident, thus do not feel good and emotionally unwanted.",

      "abstract": "Non-institutionalized elder care giving is increasingly more prevalent as the U.S. population ages and life expectancy increases. State statutes vary greatly in the way they address care giving and appropriate levels of care once a care giving relationship is established. In fact, recent state case law suggests that family members and others could unintentionally and unknowingly take on a care giver role that carries with it certain legal obligations. The current two-phase study first uses an experimental study to investigate whether a person recognizes when a care giving relationship exists and the factors that contribute to notions of being a caregiver. Results suggest that potential caregivers (125 community members) focus on their relationship with the elder and the elder's physical and financial needs with feelings of moral responsibility generally stronger than legal responsibility. The second study explores elder care giving using interviews with both an elder and the family member caregiver. Preliminary data (data collection ongoing) indicates that caregivers and elders often did not intend for the living arrangements to become permanent and the non-elders were largely unprepared for the magnitude of changes and responsibilities that would result. The elders often expressed a sense of loss for their former life and feeling supernumerary in the family.",

It is a complex and lifelong process, held by the direct exposure to the environment factors and through the mediatization of the involvement by the more experient beings towards the less experient being in a diversity of contexts conveyed by the society.

      "title": "The value of integrating the nutritional ecology into the nutrition care continuum – a conceptual and systems approach",
      "abstract": "The domestic and global diet, nutrition and health context is becoming increasingly complex. Our ability to effectively address the daunting challenges presented by malnutrition in all its forms - both clinically and from a public health perspective - is constrained by a number of issues that coalesce around our understanding of nutrition and the what, why, and how of its assessment. This complexity is further enhanced when screening, assessment, diagnosis, and care are often performed in different settings (hospital vs. school vs. home), across populations, and with a limited care team (e.g., certain care teams may only have a nurse or dietitian within a school district). In this perspective, we make the case that our ability to improve the precision of assessment, diagnosis, and intervention demands a view of nutrition as a biological variable: a complex system resulting from the interactions between our internal (biology, health status, developmental stage, genetics, etc.) and external (social determinants of health [SDOH], home, community, physical) environments, i.e., a nutrition ecology. We offer both: (i) a conceptual framework for more effectively integrating nutrition in medical assessment and etiology-based care; and (ii) suggest solutions to overcome some of the systematic challenges in the clinical care continuum. Leveraging the concept of nutrition as a biological variable which emphasizes the integration of both internal and external variables into an assessment within the Nutrition Care Process model allows for both the identification of the nutrition problem but also the root cause (etiology) of the problem. Suggestions are offered for how to integrate this approach from both a clinical and public health perspective.",

      "title": "Stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild contact in diverse family contexts: Stepfamily structure and existing family relationships",
      "abstract": "Objective: To describe stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild contact and examine how contact varies across stepfamily structures and with the strength of family relationships existing prior to stepfamily formation. Background: Stepgrandparenthood is on the rise. Little is known, however, about how stepgrandparents enact their likely ambiguous role and how this depends on the opportunities associated with and provided by the broader family context. Method: Using Dutch survey data, descriptive information about stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild contact was presented. Random intercept multilevel models were used to analyze 2,261 stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild dyads nested in 1,373 children to assess the role of stepfamily structure and existing family relationships. Results: Stepgrandparents saw their stepgrandchildren on average several times a year. When the child and/or the stepparent coresided with the biological parent and in the case of half-siblings, contact levels were higher. When the stepparent had biological children living outside the stepfamily’s household, stepgrandparents had less contact with stepgrandchildren. Contact was also lower when the divorced biological parents of the child had a nonconflictual relationship. Conclusion: Overall, the frequency of stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild contact is low. Coresidence is critical for a higher contact frequency, indicating the importance of contact opportunities and strong within-stepfamily relationships. Strong ties of the stepfamily to a former family may compete with stepgrandparent-stepgrandchild relationships.",

However, less is known about the conditions leading to support-seeking behaviors toward mothers in early adolescence. In comparison with younger children, it is assumed that the specific nature of these conditions changes with continuing cognitive maturation. To shed light on the normative development of attachment-related behaviors beyond infancy and, more specifically, on the activating conditions for support seeking, 98 early adolescents were instructed to write about a distressing situation during which they needed their mother’s support. Seven distressing conditions could be derived from the current data. Two not previously described age-relevant conditions, academic failure and social conflict, were identified. Notably, 62% of the reported conditions referred to situations Bowlby (1969/1982) originally proposed, empirically confirming the importance of these conditions in early adolescence.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung. Belastende Kindheitserlebnisse (adverse childhood experiences; ACE) wie Misshandlung, aber auch das Erleben von Gewalt in der Paarbeziehung der Eltern (häusliche Gewalt) in der Kindheit, können das Leben auf vielfältige Weise beeinträchtigen. Obwohl bekannt ist, dass ACEs häufig gemeinsam auftreten, gibt es kaum Untersuchungen zu der Bedeutung von Kindesmisshandlung bei häuslicher Gewalt und deren Langzeitfolgen. Daher haben wir das Auftreten von Kindesmisshandlung in Abhängigkeit zu dem Erleben von häuslicher Gewalt in einer repräsentativen Stichprobe der deutschen Bevölkerung ( N = 2531) untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ein deutlich erhöhtes Risiko für alle Formen von Kindesmisshandlung, wenn häusliche Gewalt gegen die Mutter berichtet wurde (Odds Ratios je nach Form der Kindesmisshandlung 4.4 bis 10.3). Für weibliche Teilnehmende stieg das Risiko für sexuellen Missbrauch, körperliche Misshandlung und körperliche Vernachlässigung stärker an als bei männlichen. Der Zusammenhang von häuslicher Gewalt gegen die Mutter mit einer niedrigeren Lebenszufriedenheit im Erwachsenenalter wurde partiell durch Kindesmisshandlung vermittelt, das erhöhte Risiko für eine schlechtere Gesundheit im Erwachsenenalter sogar vollständig. Kindesmisshandlung vermittelt somit einen großen Ateil des Zusammenhanges von schlechterer Gesundheit und geringerer Zufriedenheit bei Erwachsenen, die in der Kindheit häusliche Gewalt erlebt haben. Vor diesem Hintergrund sind ein größeres Bewusstsein für die erhöhten Risiken von Kindern, die in Haushalten mit häuslicher Gewalt aufwachsen, und Unterstützungsangebote, in denen der Kinderschutz eine zentrale Rolle spielt, zu empfehlen.",

      "title": "Rethinking discourses of family instability",
      "abstract": "Recent research suggests that an increasing number of children around the world live with parents who experience serial romantic relationships. Studies of these increasingly common family transitions has focused almost exclusively on the association between \"family instability\" and elevated levels of stress leading to children's poorer social, cognitive, and academic outcomes. In this article the author's challenge the use of the term family instability that pathologizes relational family patterns that have become normative. Specifically, the author's review evidence from studies of families in transition to discern (1) children's individual coping strategies used to deal with their parents' serial monogamy, (2) external protective processes that improve children's experiences of these transitions (children's resilience), and (3) whether family transitions confer possible advantages to children's psychosocial development. Three case examples are used to challenge the validity of labeling family transitions as \"family instability.\" Evidence suggests that there is a need to distinguish aspects of family transitions that cause stress and instability from normative—and potentially beneficial—changes that occur when a child experiences different adult caregivers over time. This shift in discourse may help to advance an applied research agenda that has pertinence to the resilience of modern families.",

      "title": "A responsibility that never rests – the life situation of a family caregiver to an older person",
      "abstract": "Background When the ageing population increases, the burden and responsibility of close family members will likely increase. Those closely related who assume a great responsibility can be significantly affected in health, well‐being and daily life. Aim This study aims to describe the life situation when family caregivers are imposed responsibility for an older person with complex care needs in their own home. Methods In this Swedish qualitative study, ten family caregivers were strategically selected in order to achieve variations in the life situation. A reflective lifeworld research design based on phenomenological philosophy was used throughout the data collection with the lifeworld interviews and the analytic process. Findings In terms of extensive responsibility, the life situation is complex and involves emotions that are difficult to manage. In essence, a paradoxical life situation is described which is experienced as both voluntarily and nonchosen at the same time. The responsibility never rests . The essential meaning is further illustrated with three constituents: loss of freedom , c ontradictory feelings and affected relationships . Conclusion A life situation with extensive responsibility for an older family member interferes with the whole life situation with an impact on health and relationships with other people. The findings are crucial for professional caregivers in order to capture the nature of family support in a way that enables a meaningful life for both the family caregiver and the older person being cared for. Knowledge of this will give professional caregivers an increased awareness of the life situation of family caregivers and provide a better understanding of the support they are longing for, and, in some countries, such as Sweden, also are entitled to by law.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The major transaction between the family and society has to do with the way in which the family can or cannot provide its own sustenance through labour market participation. Thus a central issue for family policy concerns the income-generating capacity of family members. Success in this regard will ensure that the family has little need for social policy support at least with respect to income maintenance. Limited access to the labour markett either because members are unemployed, or because family status, health, or other factors render them unable to work for remuneration, means that income may well be below the average. Beyond this, the more mouths to feed, the less likely that any given family income will adequately meet the family’s needs (Easting and Fleming, 1994; Rainwater, 1994). Moreover, in a multicultural society groups have differential access to the labour market, varying family sizes, and different earning capacities.",

The changing nature of family structure and social values play an important part in the adolescent phase of development. The expectation of different cultures and/or families influences young people, especially in the school setting. Student teachers need to be aware of the key factors that cause concern with adolescents. How young people deal with failure, especially around the time of examinations and the pressure put on them by parents and themselves, is an important issue. The variation in physical development of pupils shown, for example, in any particular class or any year cohort has implications for teachers' management of classes. These differences are particularly apparent in Years 7–9 and may stand out in activities that prosper on physical maturity or physical control.",

      "abstract": "A theoretical rationale based on the family development orientation is presented for constructing the family life stages for modal two parent nuclear families. Using these stages as a point of departure life span careers by stages are constructed for several empirically distinct types of single parent families. These careers are based on data for birth cohorts of women (1900-1949) comparing intact first marriage histories with the family histories of divorced (not married) widowed and remarried women. The paths of the latter 3 types depart in distinctive ways from the central highway of modal two parent families in timing and duration of family stages over the life span. The differences in paths of development of single parent family types and two parent families are seen primarily not in stages encountered but in the number timing and length of the critical transitions experienced. All types of single parent families experience more and longer critical transitions between equilibrium stages (stages of stable numbers and growth of members) than two parent families. Single parents who remarry and add a child experience even more transitions and more structural disorder than single parents who do not remarry. Among single parent types who remarry widowed remarrieds are least vulnerable to divorce (less even than couples in first marriages).",

The strongest determinant of time allocation, beyond basic demographic characteristics, was functional health, which was better among people spending time in most obligatory activities, both alone and outside the home. Cognitive competence was associated with media use, being alone, less rest, time with family, and time in the home. More time was spent in most-liked discretionary, but not obligatory activities. Specifically, the more time one spent interacting with friends, with household family, reading, watching television, engaging in recreation, and being in the yard, the more each of these activities was liked. While there was a strong relationship between degree of liking for most activities and personal adjustment, the actual distribution of time among the activities was quite independent of personal adjustment, with the exception of time alone, which showed a slight negative association with personal adjustment.",

      "title": "Docenti, studenti, genitori: un triangolo in crisi?",
      "abstract": "Abstract – This call for papers’ focus on the wellbeing of children at school obliges us to scrutinize the institution of school and the “confusion” surrounding it, as well as the correspondingly confused condition of contemporary adults, both teachers and parents. These issues in turn lead us to consider further factors and dimensions such as the complex future adults because they are citizens of a complex era and a complex political-institutional and socio-cultural context. Contemporary adults are widely affected by a lack of wellbeing that is often subtle rather than manifest, and at times develops into full-blown states of distress; this is the outcome of grappling with multiple life experiences that generate real or perceived instability, confusion, and inadequacy on the part of adults. These are the adults of “post-modern liquidity” and “the risk society”, whose shared “socio-existential distress” prevents many of them from authentically becoming adults, that is to say, from acquiring an acceptable, recognized degree of exemplarity, authority and “responsibility” vis-a-vis the youngest generations of children and youths. These adults find themselves trapped in tricky balancing acts, struggling to accept and maintain their parental role, while dangerously blurring the boundaries with their children, whom they take pride in viewing as friends. Adult parents who are their children’s friends and adult teachers who are their students’ pals: who thus no longer act as points of reference or guides, but on the contrary expose, young people – throughout their development – to internalizing and externalizing problems that can be serious in some cases. Riassunto – Ci sembra che affrontare il focus di questa call inerente al benessere del minore dentro la scuola ci costringa a mettere sotto la lente d’ingrandimento l’istituzione-scuola e lo “smarrimento” che la riguarda, cosi come la condizione altrettanto dis-orientata degli adulti di oggi, insegnanti e genitori, questioni che a loro volta mettono in gioco piu fattori e dimensioni. Diffuso, sottile e non sempre manifesto e il malessere, se non il vero e proprio disagio anche “educativo”, degli adulti contemporanei alle prese con molteplici esperienze di vita all’origine di condizioni e vissuti di instabilita, confusivita e inadeguatezza. Sono gli adulti della “liquidita post-moderna”, della “societa del rischio” che condividono un “disagio socio-esistenziale” che impedisce a molti di loro di diventare autenticamente adulti assumendosi una quota, sufficientemente riconosciuta come accettabile, di “esemplarita”, “autorevolezza” e “responsabilita” verso le generazioni dei piu piccoli e dei giovani adulti. Sono gli adulti costretti a difficili equilibrismi che faticano ad assumere e gestire il proprio ruolo di genitori, confondendosi pericolosamente con i loro figli di cui si vantano di essere amici. Adulti, amici dei figli in famiglia e compagni dei loro studenti a scuola che, non piu figure di riferimento e Maestri, non tutelano le giovani generazioni, ma al contrario, le espongono lungo il percorso di crescita a problemi in alcuni casi non trascurabili, dentro e fuori di se.

The process is a complex interplay of genetic-biological factors, the maturational curve, environmental influences due to the child's culture, the social class of his parents, the attitudes and manners of his caretaker(s), and his association with his peers. The combination of these factors will determine the child's individual personality traits and learning style. These traits, in turn, will have a considerable impact on the acquisition of the child's verbal and kinesic systems, which are intimately interrelated.",

      "abstract": "The situation/risk of family homelessness presents multiple interrelated issues. It has considerable negative consequences, namely the deterioration of the family members' health and well-being, and alterations in the family's dynamics, with parents sometimes being separated from their children. The aim of this research was to understand how parenting takes place in families experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness. The conducted study falls within the qualitative paradigm, using Strauss and Corbin's version of the Grounded Theory methodology. Three main categories emerged, supported by all the participating families: \"Meaning of Parenthood\", \"Key Events\", and \"Transition Circumstances\". These categories were translated into facilitating/inhibiting factors, within the following dimensions: \"Individual\", \"Family\", and \"Society\". We were able to conclude that, in the population under study, parenting is restricted, being mostly exerted in a remote manner. Furthermore, it takes on different forms, depending on the specific homelessness situation/risk. In families at risk of homelessness, we identified \"Remote Parenting with Maintained Parental Authority\", as well as \"Restricted Parenting\", when the children still lived with their parents. On the other hand, in families experiencing homelessness, we identified \"Remote Parenting with Maintained Parental Authority\", \"Unilateral Remote Parenting\", \"Interrupted Parenting\", and the \"Total Disruption of Parenting\".",

N’ayant souvent pas toute leur autonomie psychique, physique ou sociale, les résidents sont pris en charge par des professionnels peu armés pour prendre du recul face aux injonctions implicites liées aux «contaminations psychiques» issues des croyances populaires et des dispositifs d’enfermement ou de mise à l’écart reçus de l’histoire. La dépendance, ou la perte d’autonomie, induit de fait la nécessité de proximité et de contiguïté avec la personne âgée déficiente. Devant faire corps avec elle, l’aidant et le soignant se confrontent au risque d’une contamination possible. Les difficultés physique, psychologique et sociale à faire de l’autre l’immédiat objet de son travail deviennent également des sources de formations réactionnelles d’écarts excluant, en l’absence de possibilité symbolique à la prise de distance.

      "abstract": "Abstract This study examined the experience of worry in the parent–adult child relationship. A mother, father, and adult son or daughter from 213 families participated ( N = 639). Parents and adult children commonly worried about one another and their worry reflected individual characteristics (e.g., neuroticism) and relationship characteristics (e.g., importance of the relationship and ambivalence). In addition, how much adults and their parents worried about one another influenced the other party’s perceptions of relationship quality. Specifically, adults and parents rated their relationships more positively and more negatively when the other party reported worrying about them more and communicating their worries to them more frequently. Findings underscore the importance of including experiences such as worry in research on emotional complexities in the parent–adult child relationship.",

      "abstract": "A problem that involves the family reality refers to the end of marital ties, in a growing demand. This fact generates a direct and often negative impact on family relationships, causing strain, conflicts and disruption of the family, since most separations do not occur by consensus. As a result of this turbulent situation, a process called Parental Alienation arises, which occurs when a parent or guardian makes the child reject the other parent, even detesting him. Considering that such alienation begins with the separation of parents, it is noted that one of the antidotes to its practice could be shared custody, so the following question was launched: to what extent do divorced couples, who are from a judicial approval in shared custody, can they develop or not the Parental Alienation? Within this context, our general objective is to understand parental alienation and its impacts on the lives and behavior of children and adolescents. The justification for carrying out the study is due to the relevance of the theme, since parental alienation refers to the psychological interference caused in the child or adolescent by one of their parents against another family member who is also responsible for their custody and surveillance. The methodology involved in this study was based on a qualitative research, with data collection in books, articles and magazines, which deal with the theme, in a descriptive and exploratory manner. Thus, the intention of the person who causes parental alienation is to create disagreements and negative feelings in the child in relation to a specific parent, such as the father or mother, for example. And this is the germ of Parental Alienation, the child in the midst of parental conflict, a theme that involved this study.",

Issues surrounding family identity, belonging, and shared kinship are relevant in many types of complex families, but they are critically important for stepfamilies. In this study the authors examined stepgrandchild–stepgrandparent relationships; specifically, they explored how 27 stepgrandchildren ( M age = 20.8) thought and felt about their relationships with 35 skip‐generation stepgrandparents (i.e., stepgrandparents who did not help raise stepgrandchildren's parents but who have been in the lives of stepgrandchildren from birth or early childhood). Most stepgrandchild–stepgrandparent relationships ( n = 24/35) were described as emotionally close and supportive. Stepgrandchildren who perceived stepgrandparents as fulfilling traditional grandparent roles and whose parents modeled and facilitated warm, close relationships with stepgrandparents were most likely to perceive these intergenerational steprelationships as important. The findings have implications for kinship identification in diverse and complex families.",

Su objetivo es identificar las formas de intervención del trabajador social frente al abandono familiar de los adultos mayores en el Cantón Palanda durante el primer semestre de 2024, con el propósito de mejorar su bienestar y calidad de vida siendo realizado en Zamora Chinchipe entre marzo y junio, se emplearon métodos científicos inductivo-deductivos, analíticos sistémicos y bibliográficos. La investigación se centró en 80 adultos mayores, seleccionados por su capacidad de proporcionar información verídica, a quienes se aplicó una encuesta, en donde los resultados mostraron que la mayoría se siente abandonada por la falta de apoyo familiar, lo que refleja una desconexión emocional y desatención preocupantes. Factores como la distancia física, las dinámicas familiares cambiantes y la menor atención a las necesidades de los mayores contribuyen a este fenómeno. Se concluye que los adultos mayores abandonados enfrentan serias consecuencias en su salud física y mental, como deterioro emocional, aislamiento social y aumento de enfermedades crónicas no atendidas. Las estrategias implementadas por los trabajadores sociales, incluyendo el apoyo emocional, el acceso a recursos y la promoción de la reintegración familiar, han mejorado sus condiciones de vida. Sin embargo, es esencial continuar fortaleciendo estas intervenciones y promover un enfoque comunitario de políticas públicas para garantizar la protección y bienestar de los adultos mayores.",

Today, the relations in society and in the family have changed, the personality of the person in society has changed, the professional position has changed.

Further the child grows up in a certain environment, if this environment does not use the words of etiquette at all, the child gradually begins not to use those words until in perspective he also erases them from memory. Because the child adapts to the environment in our daily contacts we use “habits” or practices that simplify communication and that, in some cases, become inevitable in order to maintain good relations with others. It can even be said that every language community uses expressions such as: good morning or “mirdita”, good evening, goodbye as means of opening and closing communication",

The behavior of parents who are too worried about something that will happen to their children makes parents too overprotective, which in fact has no benefit at all. The activity of the parents' activities also causes the attachment of mothers and children to be further away, the lack of intensity of time together distorts the attachment. Changes also occur in the behavior of sleep patterns of children who are now increasingly disturbed, due to playing activities, devices or the presence of sleep behavior. Lack of sleep results in effects on the physiological and psychological growth of children.

Aktifitas kesibukan para orang tua juga menyebabkan kelekatan ibu dan anak makin jauh, kurangnya intensitas waktu bersama mendistorsi kelekatan tersebut.

One of the basic functions of the family is socialisation that means “transmitting knowledge regarding the surrounding world, cultural heritage and preparation to fulfil adult social roles addressed to the offspring. The primary socialisation takes place within the family circle, where &lt;…&gt; an individual becomes a member of the society by internalisation and generalisation of the most overall meanings thanks to the mediation of those taking care of such individual” (Kawula, 2007). The children brought up in an orphanage are subject to a specific socialisation, located in the borderland of the functioning in an institution and the family of origin. The process of becoming independent reflects such type of socialisation.",

A family member is typically 'groomed' in a staged socialisation process over many years, internalising the founder's values and eventually taking over the business. This particularly applies to sons; discrimination has been found to affect daughters' socialisation for family business leadership. Non-family members are also often treated less favourably than family members, resulting in bifurcation bias. Once management of the business has been handed over, further socialisation takes place among siblings as they adjust to the succession. This 're-socialisation' process is likely to be repeated when there is major change in family circumstances, the workplace, or the business environment. Re-socialisation can even extend to earlier generations who learn new values and ways of doing things from the younger generation who are exposed to new ideas through networks and formal and informal learning.",

      "title": "“Learning the Ropes”: An Exploration of BDSM Stigma, Identity Disclosure, and Workplace Socialization",
      "abstract": "Relationship development is a key factor for workplace socialization. People with stigmatized identities often choose to (not) disclose experiences or identities due to potential consequences. A perceived need to not disclose stigmatized, BDSM-related activities or identities can restrict relationship development at work, which should concern human resource development professionals. Imagine that you are in the middle of a divorce, and your partner is suing for sole custody of your children. She/he has argued that you are an unfit parent because you like to beat your sexual partners. Though you both know that in all circumstances your sexual partners have consented to the abuse during sex, your partner attempts to argue that you are sick and abusive—you should not be raising children. Your coworkers have offered to be a support system for you. How much detail about your situation would you provide? Organizational socialization, or the process of “learning the ropes” (Schein, 1988, p. 54), refers to how new employees are taught what is important in their new organization and how they learn the values, norms, and expected patterns of behavior (Schein, 1998). Socialization shapes personal relationships in the work place and establishes guidelines for everyday conduct (van Maanes & Schein, 1979). Organizational socialization provides a framework through which employees come to identify with their new organization (Van Maanen & Schein, 1979) and can make or break an individual’s career (Schein, 1998). Relationship building can be the primary driver of the socialization process, and work groups are the primary context in which it takes place (Korte, 2009). Relationships develop through the sharing of details about personal experiences, dispositions, past events, and future plans (Derlega & Grzelak, 1979). Such personal sharing is generally referred to as disclosure and may be restricted if an individual feels stigma regarding the information they choose to share. Stigma is “an undesired differentness from what [is] anticipated” (Goffman, 1963, p. 5). This sense of “differentness”, which is encouraged and perpetuated by society, can become internalized by individuals labeled as “other.” Identities that are stigmatized can become a source of conflict and tension, perhaps marked by failure, shame, or abnormality (Goffman, 1963). Individuals who are members of stigmatized groups, and who therefore experience stigma themselves, must often decide whether to disclose personal information to other people. In order to participate in relationship development, individuals with stigmatized identities must often decide whether to explain their experiences and identities to others or to hide, mislead, or lie about their experiences. Considering that organizational socialization is crucial to an organization’s success, that relationship building is a driving force of the socialization process, and that relationships are developed through personal sharing, the choice to not disclose personal information could have a negative impact on organizational success. This would be of interest to supervisors, managers, and human resource development (HRD) professionals.",

      "title": "How Employment Constraints Affect Low-Income Working Parents' Child Care Decisions",
      "abstract": "Child care decisions are complex and multifaceted for low-income parents because they often must incorporate multiple employment-related factors into their decisions. These decisions are often paired, either simultaneous or sequential, whereby families make child care decisions that fit within the realities of their employment contexts. These realities include generally low earnings, workplace inflexibility and limited paid time off, and high job instability. In addition, low-wage jobs are disproportionately more likely to have nontraditional and irregular work schedules as well as inflexible work policies. These employment realities further complicate the limited care options parents face due to supply, information, and cost constraints. The low wage levels of most low-skilled jobs limit the care options that parents working these jobs can afford. The available supply of some types of care options is often very limited in low-income communities. In addition, parents often have to make child care decisions with limited information about available options or the actual quality of care options. Many times, they do so with little time to find and arrange care. In this brief, we draw from a larger study on child care choices to describe how low-income parents’ employment experiences shape their child care decisions. The brief summarizes and builds on findings from a larger research report that discusses how low-income working families in two study sites make child care decisions, and how these families’ decisions are shaped or limited by key contextual factors. After we describe the research methods and sample in the two study sites, we present summary findings regarding the employment contexts of participating parents and the challenges that their employment posed for making child care choices. Then, we explore some potential policy implications. By identifying how work constraints interact with the complexities of child care, we provide a basis that can help researchers and policymakers identify policy changes that may improve the child care choices available to low-income working families.",

      "title": "Queer People’s Communication With Families of Origin",
      "abstract": "Communicating with one’s family of origin requires considerable effort for queer people (e.g., LGBTQ+; queer is used as an encompassing term to include all gender and sexual identities that are not both cis and heterosexual). Queer people must decide if they want to disclose their gender and/or sexual identities, to whom they want to disclose, how they want to communicate, and anticipate the ways their family members may react. Immediate family members, such as parents and siblings, typically play an important role in queer people’s lives and are consequently some of the first people to whom queer people talk about their gender and/or sexual identities. Yet not all these disclosures are met with positive reactions from family members. Research suggests that queer people perceive their families’ reactions range from complete acceptance to total rejection. Thus, it is often the case that queer people must cope with multiple sources of stigma. From the family members’ perspective, parents and siblings also report having varied reactions to the queer person’s initial disclosure that require them to engage in sense-making. Thus, in addition to the communicative burden of queer people, their families may also have to share in the communicative work to communicate with people outside the family or (re)construct their family identity. All this communicative labor simultaneously reflects and constructs larger overarching ideologies surrounding gender and sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Aims: This article explores the structures of relational resources that individuals with psychiatric disorders get from their family configurations using the concept of social capital. Methods: The research is based on a sample of 54 individuals with psychiatric disorders and behavioural problems, and a comparison sample of 54 individuals without a clinical record matched to the clinical respondents for age and sex. Standard measures of social capital from social network methods are applied on family configurations of individuals from both samples. Differences are tested by variance analysis. Results: Structures of family resources available to individuals with psychiatric disorders are distinct. Individuals with psychiatric disorders perceive themselves as less central in their family configurations and less connected to their family members. Their significant family members are perceived as less connected with each other. As a whole, their family configurations are smaller and do not include spouses or partners. Therefore bridging and bonding social capitals are not readily available for them. Conclusion: As family configurations of individuals with psychiatric disorders provide fewer relational resources than other families, they are not able to deal with social integration of individuals with psychiatric disorders on their own.",

Siblings can commit to not providing long-term support by living far away. If location decisions are made by birth order, older siblings may enjoy a first-mover advantage. We study siblings' location decisions relative to their parents by estimating a sequential participation game for U.S. data. We find (i) limited strategic behavior, that is, in two-child families, more than 92% of children have a dominant strategy, and (ii) a nonnegligible public good problem, that is, in families with multiple children, 18.3% more parents would have had at least one child living nearby had location decisions been made cooperatively.",

      "abstract": "A small number of fathers, mothers, and their schizophrenic children have been studied as a group and treated in family psychotherapy for periods up to 2½ years. The view of the family as a single organism provides a broader, more distant perspective than is possible with close up views of individual family members. An effort is made to avoid the use of terms and descriptions that are associated with the more familiar individual perspective. The father is described as he is seen to function in terms of the broader family perspective. Several prominent patterns have emerged when the family has been viewed from this position. The family members, particularly the father and mother, function in reciprocal relation to each other. They are separated from each other by an emotional barrier which, in some ways, has characteristics of an \"emotional divorce.\" Either father or mother can have a close emotional relationship with the patient when the other parent permits. The patient's function is similar to that of an unsuccessful mediator of the emotional differences between the parents. The most frequent family pattern is an intense two-some between mother and patient which excludes the father and from which he permits himself to be excluded. The family pattern changes under varying individual and family circumstances in the course of daily living.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diverse social ties are critical facilitators of well-being among older adults. Social ties might be especially important for aging immigrants who face multiple social and economic vulnerabilities over the life course. We investigated social ties (e.g., partners, children, other family, and friends) by immigrant status among older adults in the United States (U.S.). Data come from the 2018 Health and Retirement Study ( N = 4,006), a national sample of older adults in the U.S. We used multivariable logistic regression to compare social ties (e.g., partners, children, other family, and friends) by immigrant status. We further explored interactions with sex and race/ethnicity. Older immigrants are more likely to report that they can rely a lot on their partners (aOR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.27, 2.68) but less likely to rely on friends (aOR = 0.72, 95% CI, 0.55, 0.94) compared to non-immigrants. Older immigrants are also less likely to meet frequently with friends (aOR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.51, 0.86) and with other family (aOR = 0.71, 95%, CI, 0.55, 0.91) compared to non-immigrants. Lastly, older immigrant men are significantly less likely to meet with friends compared to non-immigrant men (aOR = 0.48, 95% CI, 0.32, 0.73). As the older population in the U.S. continues to diversify and immigrant older adults navigate their support options, older immigrants–especially men–may be at risk for less variation in their social support options, particularly from extended family members and friends.",

Multilevel models revealed declines in parent–child conflict, acceptance, and sibling negativity and increases or U-shaped patterns in sibling and parent–child intimacy over time. Birth Order × Leaving Home interactions revealed that firstborns' leaving home related to changes in family relationship qualities for both first- and secondborns, with relationships improving for firstborns and no changes or declines in relationship quality for secondborns. Overall, the results highlight the inter-relatedness of family subsystems.",

The type of attachment to his or her mother has an impact on the relationship between spouses. Couples who have a safe type of attachment to his or her mother feel confident in conflict situations; they practically are not afraid of making a mistake.

In Athens, Greece, some children work and, as a consequence, they are often absent from school classes.

Another reason for exclusion problems may be separated parents or parents lost during immigration.

      "abstract": "Using a grounded theory methodology in exploratory interviews with noncaregiving and caregiving adult children, differences were found in their experience of burden, their focus, their suffering, and their sense of responsibility. Childhood reputations appeared to follow siblings into adulthood, and they describe finding their adult positions in the family clearly circumscribed and entrenched because of family legacy. Children who were in some way different and excused from family responsibilities in childhood because they were, for example, “spoiled,” a “problem child,” the “intellectual,” or “flaky,” appeared to be unencumbered as adults when faced with caregiving responsibilities for a relative with Alzheimer's disease. Although these uninvolved and unencumbered children seemed to take less caregiving responsibility, they describe their loss and suffering in relation to a loss of identity and selfhood, whereas other children describe their burden and the overwhelming pulls and demands made on them. These preliminary findings suggest the need for systematic scientific inquiry about families, including multiple relatives, family history, impact of family‐of‐origin legacy, family reputations, and family negotiation patterns.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important debates about social security provision concerns its effects on people's behaviour: does it cause them to act in particular ways? There are several different areas in which there may be effects. The most often talked about are: The effect of benefits on people's willingness to take paid work or to work longer hours The effect of benefits on the types of family that people form, in particular whether they are more likely to become lone parents or to have more children The effect of pensions and some other benefits on people's willingness to provide for themselves, such as through saving.",

      "abstract": "RésuméOffrir des soins psychiatriques aux parents qui maltraitent physiquement leurs enfants et à ces enfants, demeure un problème très complexe. Toute thérapie devrait être centrée vers le parent impliqué, dont le problème initial est un manque de confiance fondamental en lui-même et un surmoi punitif. Toutefois, il est difficile d'inciter ces parents à suivre un traitement thérapeutique de relations parent-enfant. Dû à cette difficulté, peu de psychothérapeutes sont intéressés à travailler avec ces patients. Il en résulte alors, que cette responsabilité première de réhabilitation, retombe sur les épaules d'un travailleur social de la Société de protection de l'enfant, qui, très souvent manque d'expérience ou de formation pour aider ce genre de client.Les enfants maltraités physiquement, parviennent difficilement a avoir confiance aux autres et la mauvaise projection qu'ils font de leur image, empêchent le développement normal des relations avec ses pairs et contribuent à sa vie isolée et pseudo-mature.Il importe peu que l'enfant demeure au foyer ou soit séparé de sa famille, car on devrait également traité l'enfant et les parents ou les gardiens, car ils ont pareillement besoin d'aide pour comprendre et pour savoir réagir, face au comportement de cet enfant.Il y existe une réelle demande afin d'améliorer la compétence de plusieurs professionels qui se trouvent en contact avec ces enfants et leurs parents, afin d'arriver plutôt à les identifier et offrir les directives nécessaires pour résoudre ce problème, Après avoir identifié ces parents et leurs enfants, la qualité des services requis doit être améliorée.",

      "title": "Stress And Coping in Adolescents: The Effects of Family Configuration and Environment on Suicidality",
      "abstract": "Research examining the relationship between family disruption and suicidal behavior is integrated into a stress and coping conceptual framework. The number of suicides, unsuccessful attempts, and suicidal ideation is apparently on the rise and represents a major concern. In the last decade, the adolescent suicide rate in Quebec has doubled, and continues to be well above the national average. Parental conflict and divorce are acknowledged as important factors that may increase psychological vulnerability during the developmental phase of adolescence, consequently augmenting the risk of suicidality. Suicidal behavior during adolescence is a concomitant of prolonged and progressive family disruption, inadequate family relationships, and ineffective parent-child interactions. As such, it is not uncommon that the adolescent's psychological and social coping resotcrces are diminished, and feelings of isolation, loss, and hostility toward family members are reported. With respect to coping behaviors, it has been suggested that the adolescent from a dysfunctional home may resort to suicide as a communication system, as other efforts to communicate with family members have been perceived by the youth as ineffective. This article explores the effects of family disruption on suicidality in adolescents and provides recommendations for research and practice in school psychology.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies show that persons with a migration background (PwM) caring for a family member with dementia often experience access barriers to formal care services, and that family carers often perform the lion's share of care. Yet research offering a detailed account on their experiences of dementia care-sharing is sparse. In this paper, we respond to this knowledge gap by exploring how different social categories impact on practices of care-sharing in our participants and their families.A qualitative study of six PwM who provide care for a family member with dementia was conducted through two methods: semi-structured, life-story interviews followed by \"shadowing\" our participants in their daily lives. We were guided by intersectionality as an analytical lens in exploring the multifaceted experiences of care-sharing.Throughout our analysis, intersections of migration history and social class stood out the most. We elucidate how they influence the attainment of necessary skills to organize and share care-tasks as well as perceptions of \"good care.\" Additionally, our findings illustrate how one's position within the family, the presence or absence of supportive social networks, religion, gendered care norms, and relationship to the care-recipient are relevant to experiences of care-sharing.Rather than overemphasizing ethnicity and culture, practice and policy should take into account that intersections of various social categories affect care-sharing and the type of support that is (or is not) organized.",

      "title": "Kinship Care for the Safety, Permanency, and Well‐being of Children Removed from the Home for Maltreatment",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect are common problems across the world that result in negative consequences for children, families and communities. Children who have been abused or neglected are often removed from the home and placed in residential care or with other families, including foster families. Foster care was traditionally provided by people that social workers recruited from the community specifically to provide care for children whose parents could not look after them. Typically they were not related to the children placed with them, and did not know them before the placement was arranged. In recent years many societies have introduced policies that favour placing children who cannot live at home with other members of their family or with friends of the family. This is known as ‘kinship care’ or ‘families and friends care’. We do not know what type of out‐of home care (placement) is best for children. This systematic review was designed to help find out if research studies could tell us which kind of placement is best. Sixty two studies met the methodological standards we considered acceptable. Wherever possible we combined the data from studies looking at the same outcome for children, in order to be more confident about what the research was telling us. Current best evidence suggests that children in kinship care may do better than children in traditional foster care in terms of their behavioral development, mental health functioning, and placement stability. Children in traditional foster care placements may do better with regard to achieving some permanency outcomes and accessing services they may need. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Executive summary/Abstract BACKGROUND Every year a large number of children around the world are removed from their homes because they are maltreated. Child welfare agencies are responsible for placing these children in out‐of‐home settings that will facilitate their safety, permanency, and well‐being. However, children in out‐of‐home placements typically display more educational, behavioral, and psychological problems than do their peers, although it is unclear whether this results from the placement itself, the maltreatment that precipitated it, or inadequacies in the child welfare system. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effect of kinship care placement on the safety, permanency, and well‐being of children removed from the home for maltreatment. SEARCH STRATEGY The following databases were searched to February 2007: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, C2‐Spectr, Sociological Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts, SSCI, Family and Society Studies Worldwide, ERIC, PsycINFO, ISI Proceedings, CINAHL, ASSIA, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Relevant social work journals and reference lists of published literature reviews were handsearched, and authors contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized experimental and quasi‐experimental studies, in which children removed from the home for maltreatment and subsequently placed in kinship foster care, were compared with children placed in non‐kinship foster care on child welfare outcomes in the domains of well‐being, permanency, or safety. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Reviewers independently read the titles and abstracts identified in the search and selected appropriate studies. Reviewers assessed the eligibility of each study for the evidence base and then evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. Lastly, outcome data were extracted and entered into REVMAN for meta‐analysis with the results presented in written and graphical forms. RESULTS Sixty two quasi‐experimental studies were included in this review. Data suggest that children in kinship foster care experience better behavioral development, mental health functioning, and placement stability than do children in non‐kinship foster care. Although there was no difference on reunification rates, children in non‐kinship foster care were more likely to be adopted while children in kinship foster care were more likely to be in guardianship. Lastly, children in non‐kinship foster care were more likely to utilize mental health services. AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS This review supports the practice of treating kinship care as a viable out‐of‐home placement option for children removed from the home for maltreatment. However, this conclusion is tempered by the pronounced methodological and design weaknesses of the included studies.",

Estas reflexiones se dan en el marco de una metodología cualitativa, en la que se utilizaron técnicas como la entrevista en profundidad, el plano de vida familiar y la cartografía familiar, las cuales fueron utilizadas con padres/madres inmigrantes y sus hijos/hijas residentes en Colombia. De acuerdo con los resultados obtenidos en campo, existen tres tipos de prácticas familiares (prácticas continuas, prácticas discontinuas y prácticas creativas), las cuales involucran acciones regulares como rutinas, celebraciones y tradiciones familiares, que son mantenidas y/o recreadas a través de la memoria, los medios materiales, tecnológicos y comunicativos.",

Although potentially different for males and females, decreased family cohesion and increased interparental conflict can inadvertently provide family environments that are associated with increased feelings of loneliness, which may be associated with problems in adolescents’ social interactions (i.e., social anxiety and social avoidance). Analyses of responses from 124 late adolescents revealed that feelings of loneliness were related to perceived levels of interparental conflict for males and females and decreased family cohesion for females. Furthermore, late adolescents’ feelings of social anxiety and social avoidance were related to their feelings of loneliness. The findings in this study show how deteriorated family systems may provide contexts that are associated with adolescents’ feelings of loneliness as well as their ability to engage in social interactions outside of the family system.",

In contrast to community or nonanxious ADHD families, anxious ADHD families do not encourage independence and tend to be distinctly less assertive, self-sufficient, and autonomous. Although anxious and nonanxious ADHD children tend to have a uniformly high incidence of maternal ADHD, mothers of anxious ADHD children tend to display a much higher incidence of substance/alcohol abuse than either nonanxious or community participants.Findings are consistent with the notion that an insular, dependent, and somewhat controlling family environment characterizes families of children with ADHD and comorbid childhood anxiety.",

      "abstract": "This article approaches end of life care for elderly people from a care ethics perspective. End of life care should not be confused with assisted life ending approaches and support or euthanasia. End of life care refers to care of people who are dying, immaterial of age or medical condition. Vulnerability is not limited to elderly people (as care-receivers) only but also to caregivers as a vulnerable group in own right.\r\nCare ethics for healthcare is defined as creating a relationship between caregiver and care-receiver (in this case the elderly person), recognising their mutual vulnerability and potential power relationship within the healthcare value chain, and carrying out the responsibility to care for and protect life and its dignity in order to improve quality of life and health and grow personal life orientations. Care ethics is influenced by a changing relationship between caregiver and care receiver, ethical environment, palliative care and social determinants.\r\nUnderstanding and dealing with end of life care can never be removed from the discussion on quality of life, dignity and human suffering that adds no value to life. The Christian narrative is used to promote and uphold the dignity and prolonging of life. To this may be added, care for the dying. This narrative is built on God as the Creator of life, the duty to care for life and the respect for life no matter the quality thereof.",

      "title": "Parental Alienation: <i>In the Child’s Worst Interest</i>",
      "abstract": "Parental alienation (PA) is a form of childhood emotional abuse in which one parent instrumentally uses the child to inflict psychological harm on the other parent for revenge. The consequences of parental alienating behaviours range from mild (e.g., the child shows a certain resistance towards visiting the targeted parent but warm parenting is still possible) to severe, where the positive affective parent–child bond is severed and extremely difficult to reinstate under family therapy. In PA processes, parenting is disrupted with the targeted parent and dysfunctional with the alienating parent. Consequently, the child is at a high risk of developing internalising (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalising (e.g., use of drugs/alcohol, violence) problems during later developmental stages and through the lifespan. Although the prevalence and severity of PA cases in our societies are largely unknown, in part because the construct is still an ongoing debate among academics, practitioners and family justice professionals, different authors defend that it should be treated as a public health problem. Early prevention should be the primary objective and family justice, child protection and mental health services must coordinate efforts to support the families and promote the best conditions for the development of affected children.",

Each year some children, left at home, are abused or killed. If the procedures have been duly followed, is a bad result to be put down to incompetence or to bad luck, and, if to the latter, does that cancel moral responsibility? We examine the claim that the case is one of ‘moral luck’ and argue that the system licences greater risk than is morally justified. This is because it embodies conflicting imperatives of welfare and justice. Anyone who becomes a social worker must face a constant risk to moral integrity [1].",

      "abstract": "After more than four decades of research and almost 100 attachment studies, the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of attachment still remain unclear. To better understand the mechanisms moderating the associations of attachment orientations from one generation to the next, this empirical study examined the roles of 1) shared and non-shared environmental factors that characterize critical events in adulthood such as career choice, income and child care; 2) gender differences in attachment between parents (Generation 1, G1) and their adult offspring (Generation 2, G2) and their possible interactions. A sample of 321 families with G2 adults aged 18 and over and two G1 parents up to the age of 81 took part in this study. Both generations completed the Experiences in Close Relationships attachment measure as well as a comprehensive detailed measure of current core characteristics in adulthood (e.g. employment status, income, whether they had children) and demographic variables (gender, age). The findings suggest that the associations between the attachment orientations of G1 and the attachment orientations of G2 were moderated by G2's income, their G1 paternal income and employment status, whether G2 had children (G3) of their own, and their family status after controlling for the age of G2, and the age of both paternal and maternal G1. When the associations for both paternal and maternal G1attachment orientation with both their male and female G2 was analyzed separately, this accounted for 35% of the variance of males' G2 attachment orientation. The discussion focuses on the contribution of these findings to attachment theory and draws clinical conclusions.",

      "title": "Children's and Mothers' Contribution to Joint Reminiscing in Different Sociocultural Contexts: Who Speaks and What is Said",
      "abstract": "The study compares mothers' conversation with their 4‐year‐old children about two past events in two autonomy‐oriented (35 German and 42 Swedish families), one relatedness‐oriented (22 Cameroonian Nso families) and one autonomy‐relatedness oriented (38 Estonian families) contexts. German mothers were rather similar to Swedish mothers in talking a lot, providing a lot of information and engaging children into conversation, but they differed from Swedish mothers by talking more about social content. Swedish children were more independent conversational partners to their mothers than other children, including German children. Estonian mothers' contribution to conversation was similar to Cameroonian Nso mothers, except that they asked a lot of open‐ended questions to engage children in conversations. Estonian children did not differ from Swedish and German children in their contribution to conversations. Compared to Swedish mothers, past event talk of Estonian mothers was characterized by a bigger proportion of talk devoted to social content, but also to the child, mental states and non‐social content. It was characteristic of Cameroonian Nso mothers that they focused more on other people and actions, and their conversational dominance was larger. Differences in reminiscing were consistent with different cultural models of self and the type of autonomy – psychological or action – promoted. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "title": "Discapacidad y familia: el papel de los hermanos",
      "abstract": "Durante mucho tiempo, la mayor parte de los estudios en torno a las familias que tienen algun hijo con discapacidad intelectual se han focalizado en los padres, prestando muy poca atencion a como los otros hijos responden a esa situacion. Los estudios centrados en los hermanos no aparecen hasta la decada de los 80, y aunque han aumentado en los ultimos anos, son todavia escasos y los resultados contradictorios. Hay carencias metodologicas y resulta dificil lograr familias que quieran participar en las investigaciones, lo que hace que las muestras sean muy heterogeneas y afecten a la comparacion. Las discrepancias entre diferentes investigaciones pueden explicarse, parcialmente, por estos problemas metodologicos, pero hay que subrayar que los datos provenientes de las investigaciones realizadas hace ya algunos anos, no son totalmente pertinentes en la actualidad ya que hemos asistido, en la ultima decada, a un cambio sustantivo en el trato dado a la discapacidad desde el punto de vista de la legislacion, de las actitudes sociales y del aumento de los servicios. Todo esto ha dado lugar tambien a una transformacion en el modo de percibir y tratar a las familias de ninos con necesidades especiales; si bien hay que reconocer que uno de los grandes obstaculos al que las familias deben hacer frente, todavia en la actualidad, es el estigma que la sociedad les coloca como resultado de la discapacidad de un hijo. Por otro lado, la mayoria de las investigaciones existentes han puesto el enfasis, casi exclusivamente, en los aspectos negativos que supone tener un hermano con discapacidad, siendo muy pocos los estudios que se focalizan en las fortalezas para la prevencion.",

      "abstract": "There is ambiguity in the role of the institution that tries to be a “home” and a place of physical care and protection. Many nursing home residents are constrained by physical and social isolation, their vulnerability increased by unmet social needs. Equally, there is ambiguity in the role of the volunteer ethnographer. The obligation to do no harm is rendered more salient by resident dependence and the intensity of nursing home relationships. Ambiguities are entailed in combining the roles of researcher and volunteer in attempting to maintain observer objectivity while becoming a trusted intimate of both the residents who live in the institution and the staff who work there. How does a volunteer determine how to “ration” help when the need for it is constant? The ethnographer is challenged to limit participation and to preserve enough distance to meet the responsibilities entailed in ethical and rigorous research.",

      "abstract": "Indivíduos dependentes de álcool e drogas com histórias de abandono, encarceramento, e falta de apoio social para a vida em sobriedade são particularmente mais vulneráveis à recaída quando não encontram a prestação de serviços de longo prazo baseados no reforço comunitário e que apoiam a sobriedade. Neste contexto, a Moradia Assistida tem como objetivo promover um serviço de cuidados posteriores a dependentes químicos que não necessitam seguir institucionalizadas, mas que se beneficiariam de uma estrutura com maior suporte de tratamento. Os moradores geralmente desenvolvem fortes laços psicológicos e sociais e têm sido referidos como “ famílias alternativas”, evocando, assim, o conceito antropológico de parentesco fictício. Os resultados tanto quantitativos quanto qualitativos sugerem vários desfechos positivos deste modelo desde diminuição de custos de tratamento a longo prazo, maior taxa de manutenção da recuperação até a maior individuação e aquisição de valores outrora perdidos com a fase da adicção ativa. Assim sendo, este modelo mostra-se um importante recurso terapêutico a ser agregado na construção da rede de equipamentos já existentes para o tratamento da dependência de álcool e outras drogas.",

That is why the objective of this paper is to propose an intervention method to counteract the problem.&#x0D; KEYWORDS: Disability; Family; Psychosocial orientation; Psychosocial impact.&#x0D;",

      "abstract": "Dominant social norms relating to families shape the lives of all people. This can have negative effects upon non-traditional families. This is especially the case in terms of adoption, where a focus solely on the adoptive family can often result in the ‘disappearance’ of the birth family. This paper explores the location of birth families in relation to adoptive families by examining a sample of children's storybooks aimed at adoptive children living with lesbian or gay parents as but one example of how policy makers may come to identify dominant cultural norms that circulate about birth families in the context of intercountry adoption. A number of key tropes are identified across these books, namely the ghostly presence of birth families, and the representation of birth parents as deviant (thus warranting the removal of their children).",

      "title": "The Pediatrician's Role in Promoting the Health of a Patient in Day Care",
      "abstract": "American families have changed. More mothers are working, and more young children are being cared for outside the home. The stresses inherent in this sociologic change are great. Pediatric practice has also changed. Increasingly, pediatricians are involved not only in the medical care of the child, but in the ecologic system in which the child exists. The pediatrician has traditionally worked with parents and children to promote healthy functioning, which encompasses the physical, emotional, cognitive, and social health of the growing and developing child. Now, the pediatrician must expand this role to include working with significant other adults who interact closely with the child who spends much of the day away from home. In this way, the pediatrician will contribute to the promotion of the child's general wellbeing, and some maladaptive behaviors will be prevented. Parents and adults whom parents delegate to provide child care on a regular basis have the greatest responsibility for children. With increasing numbers of single-parent families and families in which both parents work, there is a greater use of the variety of alternative care-giving arrangements involving adults who are neither parents nor relatives of the child. Effective communication among the child's pediatrician and regular care givers is more difficult to achieve than in the past when parents provided most of the child's care. When developmental irregularities or a chronic illness are a concern, it is particularly important for pediatricians to communicate to the person(s) providing child care the unique features of the child and family. Thus the care giver will be better able to prepare an individualized program that enhances the child's development, increases self-esteem, and supports the parents' child-caring capacity.",

Conocer cómo necesita ser tratada la persona adulta mayor, identificar los recursos bioéticos involucrados en interacciones de buen trato y determinar que la presencia de recursos bioéticos en las interacciones con personas adultas mayores favorece la percepción del nivel de calidad de vida, facilitando de esta manera el llevar una vida digna. Metodología/Enfoque. Se hizo un diseño cuantitativo, transversal, con alcance descriptivo y correlacional con un muestreo probabilístico estratificado de 200 personas adultas mayores de 60 años cognitivamente aptos y de dos centros de día para personas adultas mayores en Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. Resultados/Hallazgos. Un 79 % de las personas adultas mayores viven en pareja o en familia y un 21 % viven solas, además, el 86,5 % reportó al menos una enfermedad diagnosticada y la sospecha de maltrato se ubicó en un 45,5 %. Se establece que las personas adultas mayores necesitan buen trato mediante: autonomía 25,6 % (respeto y comprensión), solidaridad 31,2 % (le tomen en cuenta y le tengan paciencia), subsidiariedad 34,2 % (atención y cuidados) y sociabilidad 9,0 % (apoyo y amabilidad). Se obtuvo un nivel de calidad de vida de un 87,5 % y una satisfacción con la vida de un 88,5 %. Discusión/Conclusiones/Contribuciones. La presencia de recursos bioéticos de autonomía, solidaridad, subsidiariedad y sociabilidad en las interacciones con personas adultas mayores favorece la percepción de la calidad de vida, facilitando de esta manera el llevar una vida digna.",

      "title": "Concurrent Planning: Understanding the Placement Experiences of Resource Families",
      "abstract": "Concurrent planning is a process by which all options for permanency are considered simultaneously for children in foster care. Children are placed with caregivers (resource parents) who are open to adoption if reunification with birth parents does not occur. This quantitative study explored resource parents’ perceptions of the concurrent planning process via surveys at two time points. Participants included resource parents of 77 infants assessed at 2 months and 1 year after placement. At Time 1, resource parents who had more birth parent visits, more concerns about legal issues, and more concerns about their interactions with the child welfare system had more negative perceptions of the placement. Although concerns decreased over time, specific concurrent planning concerns (i.e., legal issues, child welfare agency issues, birth parent visits) at Time 2 were associated with greater concerns among resource parents about the placement in general as well as about child development and behavior, perceived attachment, and their own parenting. Additionally, those with infants placed older held more concerns about their attachment to the child, the child’s attachment to them, and the child’s behavior. While concurrent planning is positive for infants in foster care, the process creates stressors for resource parents.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adolescent substance abuse is best understood as an adaptive behavior by an individual embedded within a rigid family organization. Substance abuse helps the individual deal with distress associated with family interactions. It becomes a means for raising estimates of self-appraisal and asserting some control over self and the environment. The family is involved in numerous ways in the substance abuse pattern. The fulcrum upon which adolescent substance abuse is poised is stasis in the developmental trajectories of individual and family, It becomes essential to family members to avoid the trauma of separation and individuation. The substance abuser does not become a unique and autonomous adult, but rather maintains a role within the family that has become imbued with special significance.",
