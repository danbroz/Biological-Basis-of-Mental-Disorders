      "abstract": "Abstract Focal brain lesions in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are commonly the result of toxoplasmosis or primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. In patients with less advanced HIV disease, the causes of focal brain lesions are no different from those of lesions occurring in the non-HIV–infected population. There are, however, two exceptions. Tuberculosis (TB) in the form of tuberculoma or tuberculous brain abscess is an important cause of focal brain lesions in patients who come from areas where TB is endemic or from risk groups such as intravenous drug users among whom it is relatively common. A multiple sclerosis-like illness may also occur at this stage of HIV disease, causing focal or multifocal brain lesions. This illness is included here for completeness even though it is rare. Knowledge of this complication is important, as it may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases in general.",

La importancia de la afectacion nerviosa esta dada por su gran variedad causal asi como por su extraordinaria frecuencia. Se ha senalado que las lesiones neuropsiquiatricas se producen por la accion directa del propio virus o bien por las infecciones oportunistas o las neoplasias acompanantes. El mecanismo de produccion de estos trastornos es el deterioro que produce el VIH de forma grave, progresivo e irreversible del sistema inmunologico que parece tener un paralelismo con la participacion nerviosa y en que actuan como celulas diana los linfocitos T facilitadores y el monocito-macrofago. Entre las enfermedades mas comunes observadas, se destacan el complejo demencia-SIDA, la meningitis aseptica, la mielopatia vacuolar, etc. Los trastornos psiquiatricos y psicologicos pueden depender de la demencia o ser aislados, incluso en individuos sin otros sintomas de SIDA. Los logros obtenidos con la terapia antirretroviral en la prolongacion de la vida plantea nuevos retos con la transformacion del proceso hacia una enfermedad mas cronica.",

      "title": "NEUROPSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF HIV INFECTION",
      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

      "title": "Imaging Appearance of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Encephalitis on the Diffusion Weighted Images: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause many neurological diseases. HIV-related neurological disorders can be classified as direct and indirect complications. The former are complications caused by the virus itself such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related dementia, HIVrelated seizures, and distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy. The indirect complications include autoimmune disorders, opportunistic infections, and malignancies (1). HIV encephalitis is a direct complication. HIV, being neurotrophic, causes encephalitic illness in up to 60% of patients with AIDS (1). HIV encephalitis is a direct consequence of HIV infecting the brain itself. AIDS patients with HIV encephalitis frequently present other AIDS-related intracranial abnormalities, including other infections. However, HIV encephalitis should not combine with other opportunistic infection evidence. Although the pathophysiology of HIV encephalitis and the direct effects of this disease on the brain remain poorly understood, demyelination and gliosis preferentially affect the deep white matter of the centrum semiovale (2). Most studies of HIV encephalitis cases have reported findings based on the T2 weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (1, 3-5). To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of HIV encephalitis appearing on diffusion weighted images. Here, we report on findings of diffusion weighted images from a patient with HIV encephalitis.",

      "abstract": "Over 60,000 Canadians are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Greater than 50% of these individuals will develop a neurological disorder despite the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV causes nervous system disease at all stages of infection with adverse effects on quality of life, adherence to medications, employment and survival. These disorders include opportunistic infections in addition to distinct HIV-associated neurological syndromes and undesirable treatment-related effects. The latter two groups of disorders are often undiagnosed and untreated in both adolescents and adults. Direct HIV infection of central nervous system causes HIV-associated dementia, which is a progressive subcortical dementia. HIV infection of the peripheral nervous system produces a painful sensory neuropathy termed distal sensory polyneuropathy, which may be exacerbated by several antiretroviral drugs. Other important HIV-induced neurological disorders include vacuolar myelopathy and an increased risk of seizures. Future issues that will confound the presentation and treatment of HIV-induced nervous system disorders include the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant HIV strains, increasing age of HIV-infected patients, hepatitis C virus co-infection and the Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome. Herein, we review the clinical presentations, underlying pathogenesis and treatments of this burgeoning group of neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) syndrome is defined as transient symptomatic illness associated with high-titer HIV replication and an expansive immunologic response to the invading pathogen. Seizure and epilepsy are not rare among the HIV-infected patients. Major causes of HIVrelated seizure are focal brain lesion, meningitis, metabolic derangement, and no identified causes other than HIV itself. Generally, seizure in HIV infected patients develops during the advanced stages of the disease; decreased immunity and increased chances of developing opportunistic infection in the central nervous system (CNS) predispose them to have seizures attacks. We report a case of acute HIV syndrome which presented as new-onset seizure. Since no evidence of focal brain lesion or any opportunistic infection could be found, the most probable cause of seizure could be attributed to acute HIV syndrome. The patient got better after taking anti-epileptic drug and there have been no further recurrence of episodes so far.",

Both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system may be affected and many of the complications may occur in individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, or who are seropositive for HIV alone as well as those with the established AIDS syndrome. Specific therapy is available for certain of these neurological conditions, but the clinical course in others is untreatable and progressive. Although it seems likely that the pathogenesis of some of these syndromes such as the AIDS-dementia complex are due to the direct effect of HIV on the nervous system, in others the neurological injury probably occurs as a consequence of the immunosuppression which HIV induces, or immune-mediated mechanisms.",

However, neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as dementia or depression, may impair a patient's ability to understanding and follow treatment regimens, leading directly to poor HAART adherence.

New treatment strategies for HIV have resulted in marked health improvements. Psychoneurological problems are increasingly recognized as crucial to the overall health of all people with HIV/AIDS disease. For individuals treated with antiretrovirals, there is the added issue of drug-related neuropsychiatric complications, which may arise as a result of drug-related adverse events and which may affect mental well-being. Virus also directly affect mental functioning as a result of advancing HIV inflammatory process in Central Nervous System. The management of mental health concerning the neuropsychitric symptoms, become an integral part of comprehensive HIV/AIDS care.

      "title": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: is there a hidden epidemic?",
      "abstract": "The neurocognitive disorders associated with HIV (HAND) remain among the most common clinical disorders encountered in people infected with HIV, even in an era in which potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. HAND is currently considered to encompass a hierarchy of progressively more severe patterns of central nervous system (CNS) involvement ranging from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), to minor neurocognitive disorder (MND), to the more severe HIV-associated dementia (HAD) [1]. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions have become increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. Treatment guidelines for preferred initial antiretroviral regimens and for second or salvage regimens are essentially silent on the approach to HAND. For example, HIV-nephropathy is one indication for initiation of HAART, yet inexplicably HAND is not, unless it is severe enough to manifest as dementia. Brain penetration is crucial to achieve the goal of maximal suppression of HIV replication. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antiretroviral concentrations are generally much lower than plasma concentrations, particularly for the protease inhibitors, and active efflux pumps, such as the P-glycoprotein may eliminate this class of drug [2]. An index of the CNS penetration of antiretrovirals can differentiate HAART regimens by their theoretical CNS penetration [3] and specific combinations have better brain penetration or greater efficacy in reversing HAND's deficits or suppressing CSF HIV RNA [4–7]. It remains uncertain whether individuals who have had prolonged aviremia can develop HAND. The study by Simioni et al.[8] sheds new light on this question by studying individuals with long-duration aviremia. It also raises concerns about the adequacy of current screening techniques for HAND. In their study, HAND was diagnosed in a high proportion of 200 long-duration (several years) aviremic individuals. The overall prevalence of cognitive complaints was 27%. The prevalence of HAND was 84% among patients with cognitive complaints and 64% in those without. ANI was found in 24%, MND in 52%, and HAD in 8%. HAND was more common in women, those with lower premorbid IQ (as measured by NART scores), or with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The study highlights the clinical utility of a simple, robust, and predictive screening test for HAND. In the pre-HAART era, instruments such as the HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) were developed and tested [9] and were subsequently modified for use in international settings [10]. We have less information about the performance characteristics of the HDS or other tests in the HAART era. The study by Simioni et al. suggests that using a cut-off of 14 points or less on the HDS produced a positive predictive value for HAND of 92% in those with complaints and 82% in noncomplainers. In other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer disease, screening tests such as the MMSE are widely used for early detection and disease tracking. The development of a comparable and reliable test for HAND would be clinically very useful. Some limitations of the study by Simioni et al. need to be considered. First, the issue of metacognition, namely the insight that an individual may have regarding his or her own cognitive processes. In the elderly, severe depression is frequently associated with cognitive dysfunction. This is termed 'pseudodementia' and is not typically associated with mild depression or younger age. In early pre-HAART studies, we did not find evidence for an effect of depression on neurocognitive function [11]. In recent studies, however, depression appears consistently to be associated with incident HAND [12]. In the study by Simioni et al., several instruments were included to assess anxiety and depression and HAND was associated with abnormal scores on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. A second limitation is the generalizability of these results to other populations with lower levels of education because 73% had at least a high school education. This suggests a relatively high educational level, possibly reflecting a higher level of cerebral reserve. Previous studies have suggested this may be a protective factor against the development of HAND [13]. A third limitation is that other important comorbidities for HAND, namely hepatitis C and substance abuse, were either of low frequency (19% of the cohort were hepatitis C seropositive) or were excluded (active drug use). Hepatitis C antigens have been detected in the brain [14] and among those with a history of injection drug use, coinfection can be found in up to two thirds. Epidemiological studies suggest that neurocognitive impairment is amplified when both viruses are active (S. Letendre, 2009, personal communication). HAND can develop at almost any stage of HIV infection, although it is more common as immunosuppression advances. Injection drug use, female sex, and age appear to be predictive of neurological progression [15] (N. Gandhi, 2009, personal communication). In the HAART era, HAND can develop in individuals with less advanced immunosuppression [16]. In resource-limited areas, HAND is probably at least as prevalent as in developed countries [17,18]. ANI is the mildest form of HAND and is characterized by asymptomatic or unrecognized neurocognitive impairment. Individuals with ANI are more likely to develop more severe forms of HAND [19]. HAD represents the most severe form of HAND, with significant functional impairments, and is synonymous with HIV encephalopathy and AIDS dementia complex. Since the introduction of HAART in 1996, many HAART-treated patients have shown durable and complete suppression of HIV replication. The incidence of moderate or severe dementia fell from about 7% in 1989 to only 1% in 2000, and the severity of neurological disease appears to have been attenuated [20]. Despite this remarkable effect on incidence rates, the prevalence of HAND continues at very high rates. For example, in one cohort (CHARTER), 53% of the total sample had neurocognitive impairment, with increasing rates in those with more comorbid illnesses [21]. Prevalence estimates were 33% for ANI, 12% for MND, and 2% for HAD. One important question is whether neurocognitive performance can be affected even with good control of HIV viremia. For example, one long-standing cohort study, the MACS, studied neurocognitive performance over a 5-year period in individuals without medical symptoms. There was no measurable decline in performance in the asymptomatic groups [22]. Similar findings were observed in an independent cohort [23]. The CHARTER study demonstrated that in HAART-treated participants with incidental comorbidities, there was a lower rate of NP impairment in aviremic individuals with a nadir CD4 cell count 200 cells/μl or more [21]. This rate was about half (29%) of those with less successful virological control. These findings suggest that cognitive function is generally preserved over many years in individuals who have well controlled HIV replication. In contradistinction, other data suggest that neurological injury can continue to accrue in some individuals regardless of the success of antiretroviral therapy. Immunosuppression was associated with more prevalent neurocognitive impairment but not with incident impairment, and the association of previous advanced immunosuppression with prevalent and sustained impairment suggests that there may be a non-reversible component of neurological injury that tracks with systemic disease progression [24]. Furthermore, 21% developed HAND despite effective HAART (although the precise number who were aviremic is unclear) [24]. Similarly, in a cohort of individuals with AIDS, 21% of aviremic individuals (who also had undetectable CSF HIV RNA) progressed to HAD [25]. A third prospective study also identified HAND in 8–34% (depending on the time point of the assessment) of aviremic patients without comorbidities and with a nadir CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl [26]. Identified risk factors for HAND include a high HIV viral set point, lower CD4 cell counts [27], anemia, low body mass index, increasing age, systemic symptoms [27,28], injection drug use [29], and female sex [30]. In early cohort studies before HAART, CSF HIV RNA levels were associated with progression to HIV-D, but this relationship is not seen in HAART-treated individuals [31]. High concentrations of plasma tumor necrosis factor α and CSF monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were predictive of the development of HAND [12]. Circulating HIV DNA concentrations, which may be related to persistence of infection in cells of the monocyte lineage, are high in individuals with HAND [32]. Host genetic factors may underlie susceptibility to HAND. The most interesting include CCL2 (MCP-1) mutations and mutations in its receptor CCR2 (64-I allele), likely by influencing CNS monocyte infiltration [33,34]. So, is HAND indeed an important clinical disorder and does the study by Simioni et al. suggest that we are facing a hidden epidemic among aviremic individuals. Or rather, are these simply nosological manifestations with no clinical implications. We now know that people with HAND have a significantly increased risk of death [35]. In a Canadian cohort, the survival of individuals with MND/HAND was only one-third of those without (C. Power, 2009, personal communication). Worse antiretroviral adherence may be a contributing factor, as suggested by observations that noted that patients who died had higher plasma HIV RNA levels and were more cognitively impaired at baseline, despite no significant differences in the patterns of HAART usage [12]. Taken together, the data suggest that we cannot be complacent and assume that systemic virological and immunological control will uniformly control CNS disease. If indeed there is a 'hidden epidemic' of neurological disease in aviremic individuals, then we must develop and promulgate screening techniques to detect and track HAND and screening should be included in routine care. Furthermore, integration of these data into treatment guidelines is important and the assuming that systemic treatment 'will take care of the brain' is dangerous. Finally, the population of HIV-infected individuals is aging and further study is needed to assess the concatenation of age-related and HIV-related cognitive deterioration. We cannot ignore the very unique characteristics of the brain as a potential sanctuary for persistent infection and ongoing inflammatory damage.

Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People living with HIV can experience cognitive impairments that affect their memory, concentration, attention, and motor skills. When cognitive impairments are not clearly attributable to another cause besides HIV infection, they are collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). These issues can occur and progress even when patients are appropriately treated with good virologic control; even in the post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, neurocognitive impairment, ranging from asymptomatic cognitive impairment to more severe deficits, can occur in up to one-third of people with HIV. Low nadir CD4+ T-cell count correlates with severity of cognitive dysfunction in HAND even if counts have subsequently been well controlled, possibly because of HIV reservoirs that can remain in the central nervous system after initial viral infiltration across the blood–brain barrier. Women with HAND may have more severe disease likely due to a variety of socioeconomic factors, including higher barriers to education and health care at baseline. Specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, in addition to standard volumetric MRI, may help diagnose or track HAND. Initiation of effective ART is the most important element in treatment of the condition, although HAND may persist even with appropriate ART.",

      "abstract": "Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often accompanied by neurological complications. One of these includes disorders affecting the peripheral and visual nervous system, especially during the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) stage.The peripheral neuropathies associated with infection by HIV are an assorted group of disorders, which include acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple mononeuropathy and neuropathies related to the herpes zoster virus or cytomegalovirus. The most common and clinically important of the neuropathies is painful distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP). The most severely affected cranial nerves are V and VII. The isolation of HIV from the affected nerves suggests a direct role, but an immune mechanism is also possible. Although cytomegalovirus may be associated with a variety of peripheral nerve syndromes, its clinical presentation as a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy is unusual.DSP and antiretroviral toxic neuropathy are the most common HIV-associated neuropathies. Both HIV infection, by itself, and the neurotoxicity of certain drugs in tritherapy contribute to the development of painful peripheral sensory neuropathy. In researching into the cause of HIV-associated neuropathy further studies are needed to determine the relative roles played by the viral infection and the activation of the immunological factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of the damage done in axons, the dorsal root ganglion and in the sensory pathways in the spinal cord.",

This is well illustrated in Zika virus-associated congenital brain malformations but also in West Nile virus-induced synaptic dysfunctions that can last well beyond infection and lead to cognitive deficits.

The etiology of headache in the HIV population is often multifactorial, and attributing causality to specific pathophysiological mechanisms is challenging. Headaches can occur any time during the infection and may be primary (as in non‐ HIV ‐infected patients) or secondary (either from HIV directly or due to opportunistic disease). Discussion Direct HIV related headaches are due to the underlying viral pathophysiology. For example, acute meningitis can be seen during HIV ‐1 seroconversion. Headaches can occur during symptomatic HIV and also after an AIDS ‐defining illness. Late‐stage HIV headache can occur without any pleocytosis. A correlation between viral load and neurological symptoms including headache has been suggested. There may be similar mechanisms involving migraine, tension‐type headache, and HIV infection. Conclusion Secondary HIV headaches can be related to opportunistic infections, malignancy, medications used to treat HIV , and immune restoration inflammatory syndrome.",

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease of the CNS caused by oligodendroglial destruction due to JC virus. Usually it manifests with focal neurological deficits such as motor weakness, sensory abnormalities, visual disturbances, cognitive impairments, movement disorders having a low incidence in these patients. We report a rare case of myoclonus as a neurological complication of PML in AIDS, analyzing the link between the stage of HIV infection, the MRI lesions and the type of myoclonus, being also aware of potential interactions between the antiepileptic drugs and the antiretroviral therapy.",

Its cardinal clinical manifestations, occurring singly or in combination, are headache, fever, altered consciousness, and focal neurological deficits. The inflammatory process may be generalized throughout the brain or restricted to focal involvement. It may also involve the meninges. The diversity of clinical features reflects these patterns of involvement and a particular clinical picture is seldom specific to an individual infectious agent. Encephalitis is often an unusual manifestation of a common infection. This leads to variation in the relationship between the systemic infection and the neurological illness because individual agents vary in their propensity for CNS involvement and the prognosis of the neurological illness. The pathogenesis of encephalitis is heterogeneous even for a single infectious agent and may follow an acute, subacute, or chronic course. This chapter will be limited to discussing infective causes. Prion disease, metabolic or toxic encephalitides, postinfectious demyelinating disease, and encephalitis in immunodeficiency, including that caused by HIV infection, are not discussed in this chapter.",

      "title": "Knowing the unknown – CD8 encephalitis: A novel form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder",
      "abstract": "Sir, Spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) varies from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to minor neurocognitive dysfunction to HIV-associated dementia. It is the most common central nervous system (CNS) complication of HIV.[1] Cluster of differentiation-8 (CD8) encephalitis is a new form of CNS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)[2] characterized by CD8+ Tcell infiltration into the brain without high viral burden in the CNS or typical IRIS presentation.[3] CD8+ cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post-gadolinium T1 perivascular contrast enhancement are diagnostic.[4] Very few cases have been reported.[3,4,5,6,7] To the best of our knowledge, no case has been reported from India. A 55-year old right-handed businessman, a known case of retroviral disease, presented in July 2014 with a 3-month history of increased sleepiness, episodic involuntary facial movements, memory disturbance, and slurring of speech. He was diagnosed with HIV-1 10 years back and started on an AZT/3TC/NVP regimen [AZT (zidovudine), 3TC (lamivudine), NVP (nevirapine)]. Four years later, he developed pneumocystis-carinii pneumonia wherein his CD4 counts decreased >50% and viral load increased to >7,00,000 copies/ml. Hence, he was shifted to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART)–TDF/FTC/ATV(r) (tenofovir, emtricitabine, boosted atazanavir). He was virologically well suppressed on the second regimen for 5 years. On admission, his Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score was 19 with impaired recall and calculation. CNS examination revealed a bilateral upper motor neuron facial nerve involvement, a prominent jaw jerk, grade 4 power in all four limbs with spasticity, hyperreflexia, bilateral ankle clonus, and bilateral Babinski's sign. The patient had spastic dysarthria with intermittent facial tics. He was investigated as shown in Tables 123 and Figures 1234 below. In view of the magnetic resonance imaging findings and a stable CD4 count, special CSF investigations were done, as shown in Table 4. Investigations revealed a significantly elevated CD8+ T-cell count in the CSF along with elevated CNS HIV viral load in the presence of suppressed plasma viral load. CNS immune dysregulation was thus evidenced by disproportionate presence of CD8+ T-cells in the CSF. Hence, he was given intravenous pulse methylprednisolone 500 mg for 5 days and ART regimen modified to ABC/3TC/DRV (r) combination (abacavir, 3TC, boosted darunavir) for better CNS penetration. His facial tics and drowsiness improved within 2 weeks, followed by gradual improvement in memory (MMSE 26) and spasticity over the next 8 weeks. At 2 years of follow-up, he is stable without any neurological deterioration.Table 1: Serial CD4 and viral load in the past 10 yearsTable 2: Routine investigations on admissionTable 3: CSF routine and special investigations on admissionFigure 1: T2-weighted axial image showing hyperintensities in bilateral periventricular white matter. Arrows show that the periventricular hyperintensities are more prominent over the frontal horns (front vertical arrows)Figure 2: T2 FLAIR axial image. Arrow in the right hemisphere showing asymmetric hyperintensity in the right periventricular and right fronto-parietal white matter. In the left hemisphere, the hyperintensity in high parietal white matter is indicated by the vertical arrow and the hyperintensity in the left parieto-occipital junction indicated by the horizontal arrowFigure 3: Post-gadolinium contrast T1-weighted image showing enhancement perpendicular to ventricular margins (arrows indicating enhancement better appreciated on the left side) most likely representing perivascular enhancementFigure 4: DWI (diffusion-weighted images) showing periventricular diffusion restrictionTable 4: Special CSF investigations to diagnose CD8 encephalitisCD8 encephalitis is characterized by a diffuse but predominantly perivascular infiltration of polyclonal CD8+ lymphocytes. Four causes have been identified: trivial infection in well-controlled patients, CNS IRIS, virological escape, and highly activated anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) interruption.[3] Mascolini's group of 14 HIV patients had a median age of 41 years, HIV infection for 10 years duration, median CD4 of 493, and median plasma viral load 117 copies. The condition presented subacutely in almost 50% patients, which included epilepsy, headache, coma, dizziness, confusion, dementia, mild memory disorders, neurologic deficit, and \"mood troubles.\"[4] Our patient was a pentagenerian living with HIV for more than a decade and a median CD4 of 460. He presented subacutely with memory disturbance and bipyramidal signs. The pyramidal signs were unique as it has not yet been reported in literature. These symptoms usually occur during immune reconstitution (early in the course of therapy) or during treatment interruption[4] unexpectedly striking clinically and immunologically stable patients.[3] Our patient similarly presented when he was immunovirologically stable [Table 1] on second-line ART for 5 years. ART drugs have a CNS penetration effectiveness (CPE) score. As per studies, regimens with a high CPE score are essential to achieve CSF HIV-1 ribose nucleic acid (RNA) suppression,[5,6,8] and it is a better predictor of treatment failure.[9,10] A close differential diagnosis is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). In CD8 encephalitis, T2- fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR) hyperintensities are more diffuse and poorly delineated in contrast to the large and multiple lesions seen in ADEM, but the principal differences are the gadolinium-enhanced lesions. In CD8 encephalitis, they are thinner than 2mm and follow perivascular spaces with a linear/punctuate shape amidst the FLAIR hyperintensities, whereas in ADEM, the enhancement is peripheral with a ring/incomplete ring-shaped formation.[3] Lesions in HIV encephalitis, in contrast to CD8 encephalitis, are typically located periventricularly, in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, or brainstem, and there may also be atrophy.[11] Progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) exhibits multifocal white matter lesions with features of demyelination which spare the cortical ribbon. It is also characterized by a hyperintense signal on T2WI, dark signal on T1WI, no edema/mass effect, and a rare enhancement with gadolinium (contrast to CD8 encephalitis).[12] Interestingly, some experts hypothesize that PML is due to CD8+ T-cell lymphocytopenia, as its presence in the CNS compartment is protective against JC-virus.[13] Our case had bilateral hyperintensities on T2-FLAIR and perivascular enhancement on post-contrast sequence, which were diagnostic. CSF pleocytosis in these patients comprised >90% lymphocytes, which were mainly CD8+ lymphocytes expressing the CCR5 phenotype. The mean CSF HIV viral load was 5949 copies/ml in one study[3] and 2236 copies/ml in the second[4] without any role of blood CD8 count.[3] Our case had a CSF HIV viral load of 11,157copies/ml and disproportionately increased CSF CD8 cells. In certain cases, the inflammation after HIV infection may overshoot its objective. Corticosteroids block this phenomenon. One study showed a mean survival time of 8 years,[3] whereas the other reported considerable improvement with steroids in one-third of patients over a median follow-up of 4 years.[4] Patients were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a tapering dose of prednisone (1 mg/kg for 2 months followed by a reduction of 5mg every 2 weeks) for a median period of 6 months as proposed in ADEM.[3] Our patient responded to methylprednisolone and is stable on follow-up despite no long-term oral steroids being administered. The triad of subacute diffuse severe encephalitis, CD8+ T-cells in CSF, and a diffuse leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion and perivascular contrast enhancement on imaging has been suggested as the diagnostic triad for CD8 encephalitis. In the absence of CSF flowcytometry for diagnosis in resource-limited settings, a post-contrast T1 spin echo-sequence with magnetization transfer should be done in a patient with suppressed plasma viral load with unexplained cognitive decline. Clinicians should be cognizant of this entity as it is treatable by corticosteroids and ART modification. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders related to neuroinfections are highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), constituting a major cause of disability and economic burden for patients and society. These include epilepsy, dementia, motor neuron diseases, headache disorders, sleep disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. The highest prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is in SSA. Consequently, there is a high prevalence of neurological disorders associated with HIV infection such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, motor disorders, chronic headaches, and peripheral neuropathy in the region. The pathogenesis of these neurological disorders involves the direct role of the virus, some antiretroviral treatments, and the dysregulated immune system. Furthermore, the high prevalence of epilepsy in SSA (mainly due to perinatal causes) is exacerbated by infections such as toxoplasmosis, neurocysticercosis, onchocerciasis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and the immune reactions they elicit. Sleep disorders are another common problem in the region and have been associated with infectious diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis and HIV and involve the activation of the immune system. While most headache disorders are due to benign primary headaches, some secondary headaches are caused by infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess). HIV and neurosyphilis, both common in SSA, can trigger long-standing immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS) potentially resulting in dementia. Despite the progress achieved in preventing diseases from the poliovirus and retroviruses, these microbes may cause motor neuron diseases in SSA. The immune mechanisms involved in these neurological disorders include increased cytokine levels, immune cells infiltration into the CNS, and autoantibodies. This review focuses on the major neurological disorders relevant to Africa and neuroinfections highly prevalent in SSA, describes the interplay between neuroinfections, immune system, neuroinflammation, and neurological disorders, and how understanding this can be exploited for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for improved patient care.",

The pure neuritic leprosy is a diagnostic challenge that may require nerve biopsy or nerve aspiration cytology. The treatment itself may lead to a 'reversal reaction', which further causes injuries to the nerve. HCV-related neuropathies may be related or not to the presence of cryoglobulins. The absence of vasculitis, the most frequent form is a peripheral sensory neuropathy involving small nerve fibers, and more accurately diagnosed by pain-related evoked potentials. HIV-related neuropathy has become the major neurological complication of HIV infection. Both HIV-induced neuropathy and antiretroviral toxic neuropathy are clinically indistinguishable. The existence of an isolated chronic polyneuropathy due to Borrelia burgdorferi remains highly controversial. Lastly, an active infectious ganglioneuritis caused by varicella zoster virus, producing shingles, is the most frequent infectious neuropathy in the world and may cause various neurological complications. Zoster sine herpete remains frequently undiagnosed.Recent data have improved our knowledge and diagnostic tools of infectious neuropathies.

Here, we briefly describe a few examples of such infections causing severe diseases that result in the loss of motor-sensory function (cerebral malaria, viral encephalitis), alterations of cognition/behavior (AIDS), or sleep perturbations (African trypanosomiasis).

      "abstract": "More than 15% of the world's burden of disease is attributable to interlocking neurologic and psychiatric (neuropsychiatric) disorders; these syndromes include mood disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, dementia, epilepsy and chronic pain disorders.1 Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HIV infection represent the convergence of a major global infectious epidemic with nervous system disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality, especially as the disease progresses to AIDS. HIV directly infects and injures the central and peripheral nervous systems, culminating in a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders (collectively termed neuroAIDS), including neurocognitive disorders such as HIV-associated dementia, minor neurocognitive disorder, mania/psychosis, anxiety, depression, seizures, and myelopathy and neuropathy with accompanying chronic neuropathic pain and physical disabilities (Fig. 1). In fact, HIV entry into the nervous system (neuroinvasion) occurs early after primary infection but persists throughout the disease course because the virus chronically infects glial cells (neurotropism) and has ensuing potential for nervous system disease (neurovirulence). However, only a subset of people with HIV exhibit nervous system disease, indicating selective vulnerability to a neuropsychiatric phenotype (neurosusceptiblity) caused by HIV, defined by age, level of concurrent immunosuppression, comorbidities and both host and virus genetic diversities.2 These neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with diminished quality of life,3 increased health care costs4 and reduced survival.5 Several of these disorders are also apparent in children with HIV who also have developmental delay.6 In addition, systemic immunosuppression increases the risk, particularly among adults, of opportunistic processes within the nervous system, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, toxoplasmic encephalitis, cryptococcal and tuberculous meningitis and primary central nervous system lymphoma associated with seizures, physical and cognitive disabilities, psychosis and mood disorders.",

Disorders may be as varied as depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, AIDS phobias, grief and the whole gamut of cognitive disorders. In addition, several psychiatric conditions may predispose individuals to acquiring HIV infection as a consequence of their influence on behaviour. There is also strong evidence of the relationship of substance use disorders and severe mental illnesses with HIV infection. HIV related psychiatric disorders also offer a challenge to clinicians in issues of differential diagnosis and management.

REVIEW SUMMARY Common primary complications include an encephalopathy, sometimes termed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex, causing progressive cognitive, motor, and behavioral deterioration. A myelopathy resulting in nonfocal spinal cord dysfunction is often encountered in advanced HIV. Peripheral neuropathy, most typically a painful distal sensory neuropathy, is also frequent, whereas HIV-associated myopathy is an uncommon but important complication. These manifestations must be distinguished from opportunistic complications such as cryp-tococcal meningitis, toxoplasma encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cytomegalovirus-induced encephalitis and radiculomyelitis. The most common neurologic neoplastic complication is primary central nervous system lymphoma. Current pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies for these complications are reviewed. CONCLUSION HIV treatment and the recognition and treatment of neurologic complications are becoming increasingly successful and important. The clinician must actively consider the unique neurologic complications likely to be encountered in HIV to provide optimal care to patients with HIV.",

Although a variety of HIV- related disorders may cause headache, many HIV-infected persons suffer from migraine or tension-type headaches that are not related to HIV. Moreover, HIV- infected patients with fever frequently develop headache, even in the absence of a central nervous system abnormality. The differential diagnosis of headache expands as the patient’s CD4 count decreases. At any stage of HIV disease, a patient can develop headache from bacterial meningitis, neurosyphilis, medications, migraines, or muscle contraction. Certain intracranial infections, including cryptococcal meningitis and Toxoplasma encephalitis, generally do not occur until the CD4 count decreases to less than 200 cells/mm3 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and primary central nervous system lymphoma predominantly occur in patients who have CD4 counts less than 100 cells/mm3 Analyzing the patient’s symptoms (quality of pain, duration, sensitivity to light and sound) is often not helpful in determining the cause of the headache. HIV-infected patients who develop headache associated with a focal neurologic deficit usually have a serious central nervous system disorder.",

The pathological abnormalities in patients with subacute HIV-encephalitis are most prominent in subcortical structures, notably in the cerebral white and deep gray matter. The patients frequently develop abnormalities in cognitive, motor and behavioral functions. The infected cells are predominant lymphocytes and macrophages. The production of cytokines by these cells appears to be a central factor in the pathogenesis of subacute HIV-encephalitis. The central nervous system can function as a reservoir of HIV infection.

One of the common HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy presents with advanced immunosuppression in patients and is frequently associated with dementia. However, most cases are subclinical with characteristic findings identified through physical examination and/or imaging modalities. HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy is characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, gait disturbance and lower extremity sensory abnormalities including vibratory sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in the spinal cord are abnormal in some patients with HIV-associated myelopathy, characteristically showing spinal cord atrophy at the level of the thoracic spine, but they may also be normal. Unfamiliarity with this as initial presentation of HIV infection may lead to failure to diagnose and intervene appropriately. We present a case of newly diagnosed HIV with myelopathy and dementia with minimal spinal cord involvement on magnetic resonance imaging.",

As with any other neurologic disorder, the site of the neuraxis that is affected must be properly identified. In HIV-1-infected persons, more than one site may be involved simultaneously, such as the coexistence of myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy, often resulting in a confusing array of neurologic signs and symptoms. The frequent occurrence of two or more diseases affecting the neuraxis, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and toxoplasmosis, further complicates the picture. With the AIDS patient, the physician cannot rely on the clinical adage that all attempts should be made to ascribe the patient's problems to one disease. Often, it is not the case. As with other illnesses, the approach to the HIV-1-infected person with neurologic disease needs to be thorough and fluid. After rendering a diagnosis and embarking on therapy, the physician needs to be open minded about the possibility of an incorrect or additional diagnosis not previously considered. Lastly, despite all the knowledge that has been accumulated in the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, new illnesses occurring with HIV-1 infection are recognized with regularity. The physician must always bear in mind that the illness with which he or she is confronted may be one that has not been previously described.",

      "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is widespread and affects 71 million people worldwide. Although hepatic manifestations are the most frequent, ranging from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, it is also associated with several extrahepatic manifestations. Infected patients may present non-specific neurological symptoms, regardless of the presence of liver cirrhosis. Several pathogenetic mechanisms underlying neurological symptoms have been hypothesized: neuroinvasion, immune-mediated damage, neurotransmitter alterations and cryoglobulinemia. Alterations of the central nervous system include cerebral vasculopathy, acute or subacute encephalopathy and inflammatory disorders. HCV infection may be responsible for neuropathies, of which the most frequent form is symmetrical axonal sensory or sensory-motor polyneuropathy which causes loss of leg sensitivity and weakness. Up to 50% of patients with HCV infection may experience cognitive decline and psychological disorders, such as depression and fatigue. HCV associated neurocognitive disorder is independent of the presence of liver cirrhosis and affects different domains than in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. It can be studied using specific tests that mainly explore executive functions, verbal learning and verbal recall. These disorders significantly reduce the quality of life. The new antiviral therapies improve the extrahepatic symptoms of HCV infection and their success depends on the achievement of sustained virological response. However, the effect of therapy may differ depending on the type of organ involved; neurological symptoms can be irreversible if there is organic liver damage. The aim of this review is to provide a critical overview of physiopathological mechanisms, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of the neurological and psychiatric effects of HCV infection.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, survival rates associated with HIV infection have been greatly improved. However, HIV patients commonly develop neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Literature review: During the first weeks of HIV infection, the virus enters the Central Nervous System by a “Trojan horse” mechanism. HIV-activated infected immune system cells release cytokines, quemokines, toxic viral proteins and infectious virions in the CNS that drive progression of the infection and inflammation. The chronic inflammation induces a form of “sickness state behavior,” which its charecteristcs. As HIV is a chronic infection, this induces a chronic manifestation of sickness behavior, which is very similar to MDD. Therefore the persistent CNS cytokine response provides a basis for the depressive state. In addition, HIV patients frequently suffer significant cognitive deficits. HIV depression may result from a combination of psychological stress, biochemical dysfunction (lower neurotrophins and monoamines, glutamatergic disturbances, glucocorticoid receptor resistance, the production of neurotoxic metabolites, and oxidative stress) due to chronic viral neuroinflammation, and neuronal death that surpasses neurogenesis. Depression itself is reversible, but as it becomes chronic or recurrent, cognitive deficits may arise. This cognitive decline suggests a link between HAND and HIV depression. Conclusion: Depression among PLHIV is due to its high prevalence rates, and its serious negative impact on the evolution of HIV infection is a public health concern. It probably results from complex interactions between psychosocial factors and the neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic viral effects on the brain.",

Most opportunistic infections of the central nervous system presumably are caused by toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus and cryptococcus neoformans. One tenth of all patients have neurological disease as their initial symptom of AIDS. The diagnosis should always be considered in patients at risk and in males with an unusual neurological history or with a peculiar CT scan of the brain.

      "title": "HIV on the brain: is neurosignalling damage irreversible even on antiretroviral therapy?",
      "abstract": "Even with successful antiretroviral therapies (ARTs), comorbidities in persons with HIV (PWH) remain high. Among these are a range of neurocognitive impairments presenting within the full spectrum under HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which can range from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to the severe neurological dysfunction affecting activities of daily living [1]. Multiple causes associated with HIV disease may exist and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined, but neurocognitive dysfunction is thought to be largely driven by neuroinflammation and dysregulation of neural and immune networks in the central nervous system (CNS) [2]. Also, alcohol abuse in addition to HIV infection has the potential to further decrease neurocognition, though study results can be conflicting: some found no correlation of days of intoxication to degree of neurocognitive impairment [3], but PWH users of alcohol also display lower than average neurocognition [4]. Although suppression of virus by ART can potentially dampen inciting factors driving neuroinflammation, it is unclear if treatment intercedes on all facets of neuroinflammation and restores neural connections. In this issue, a new study by Maxi et al.[5] uses a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque model wherein they study the effects of infection as well as binge alcohol use on measures of neuroinflammation. The investigators further evaluate the impact of ART in this model to reduce inflammation and restore neurosignals. Although ART reduced most measures of neuroinflammation, including IBA1, CX3CR1 and GFAP gene expression in the frontal cortex, and CD74 and CD11ß in the basal ganglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling was not restored in either anatomical location. BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, is one of the most abundant neurosynaptic factors in the brain and mediates CNS plasticity. Loss of BDNF is associated with memory and learning deficits, and has been associated with increased incidences of depression and Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, multiple studies have shown that loss of BDNF also correlates with severity of HAND [6], where cerebrospinal fluid BDNF levels were significantly lower in PWH with HIV-dementia when compared with PWH without dementia [7]. Serum BDNF levels also correlated directly with performance on neurocognitive tests of executive functions and memory [8]. In a cross-sectional study of 350 PWH and 50 HIV seronegative individuals, ART did not alter serum levels of BDNF in PWH, although CNS BDNF values were not assessed [9]. Furthermore, alcohol exposure, specifically beer and liquor, was also associated with decreased serum BDNF in PWH in that study. Although moderate alcohol ingestion can acutely trigger BDNF release, which prevents progression to compulsive alcohol consumption, chronic heavy alcohol consumption eventually disrupts the protective functions of BDNF [10,11]. Chronic alcohol exposure may further exacerbate the reduction of BDNF in the brain of PWH. Additional knowledge is lacking on BDNF regulation in terms of timing and duration of alcohol and HIV exposures. To determine specific neurocognitive or behavioural issues correlating to perturbations in BDNF signalling during lentivirus infection is admittedly challenging to address in humans and often not adequately measurable in macaque models. A recent cross-sectional study of 109 PWH aged 50 years and older showed significant inverse correlation of BDNF plasma levels with depression [12]. However, the exact dynamics of BDNF signal alterations in relation to HIV and ART exposures still need to be understood to inform therapeutics. Given the significant role played by BDNF in neurocognition, it is crucial to determine in PWH if ART can reverse HIV induced BDNF changes the brain, especially in those with chronic alcohol abuse. Given the difficulties of sampling the brain in humans, nonhuman primate (NHP) infected with lentivirus offers an opportunity to determine this. In this new study, Maxi et al.[5] started dosing NHP with alcohol 3 months prior to SIV infection and continued through the end of the study, while ART was given 2.5 months after infection and tissues obtain 11 months after infection. Although this study timeline modelled the most likely sequences of exposures in human, longitudinal studies with CNS samplings at multiple time points could further elaborate the findings. The reduction of BDNF in PWH who abuse alcohol is most likely a consequence of both viral infection induced neuroinflammation and alcohol-related neurosignal suppression. Due to this multifactorial causation, treatment of the virus alone may not be enough, as shown in the current study by Maxi et al.[5]. In addition to prescribing physical exercises to increase BDNF levels in the brain [13], there are a number of drugs that modulate BDNF signalling, including several antidepressants and small molecule mimetic of BDNF such 7,8-DHF and P021 [14,15]. Studies in rodents and in postmortem human brains demonstrated that antidepressants such as ketamine increased BDNF levels in the brain by activating the TrkB receptor [16–18]. Delivery of BDNF or mimetic or inducers into the brain could also be improved with new gene therapies. Thus, treatments to restore BDNF in the CNS could supplement therapies for PWH demonstrating neurocognitive impairment. Treatment of HIV infection with ART has altered HIV infection to a chronic disease, but complimentary treatments targeting comorbidities need to be considered and better studied to optimize complete health of PWH.

In addition to psychiatric symptoms, CNS infections may also present with other signs such as fever, meningism, cranial nerve deficit, and seizures.

      "abstract": "Abstract Lymphoma occasionally affects the peripheral nervous system. When it does, the diagnosis can be elusive since many patients present without known lymphoma. Most peripheral nerve complications are due to non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which infiltrates nerves causing axonal damage. This disorder can affect nerve roots and cranial nerves, often associated with lymphomatous meningitis. NHL may also infiltrate peripheral nerves and cause plexopathy, mononeuropathy, or generalized neuropathy. These neuropathies may resemble an asymmetric mononeuropathy multiplex or a generalized disorder such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. When NHL infiltrates diffusely, the term neurolymphomatosis is used. Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), by contrast, rarely infiltrates nerves. More often, HL causes immunological disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as inflammatory plexopathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome. Other rare lymphomas such as intravascular lymphoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia can also affect peripheral nerves in specific ways. In addition, other malignant and nonmalignant lymphoproliferative disorders enter into the differential diagnosis of lymphomatous neuropathy. This review discusses the multiple peripheral nerve presentations of lymphoma from the clinician's point of view and provides a guide to the evaluation and diagnosis of these uncommon, challenging disorders.

      "title": "Asymptomatic neurosyphilis may need early intervention in people living with HIV",
      "abstract": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) and is of global and historic significance. People living with HIV (PLWH) infection are frequently coinfected with syphilis, because of the overlapping modes of pathogen acquisition. Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis infection, and PLWH are at a greater risk of developing neurosyphilis in early and late latent syphilis, including asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) infection than those without HIV infection. Some patients with neurosyphilis present neurological manifestations such as meningitis, stroke, cranial nerve dysfunction, auditory or ophthalmic abnormalities, and acute changes in mental status. However, some neurosyphilis cases in PLWH lack signs or symptoms of CNS infection. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis is diagnosed in the absence of neurological signs or symptoms and can only be detected in the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities indicative of CNS infection, including mononuclear pleocytosis, increased protein concentration, and/or a reactive CSF venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) assay. This has raised concerns that a persistent reservoir of T. pallidum although asymptomatic in the CNS, may result in treatment failure and neurological sequelae in PLWH. Neurosyphilis might lead to cranial nerve palsies, syphilitic meningitis, general paresis, and tabes dorsalis even several years after infection. Thus, early intervention may be needed for asymptomatic neurosyphilis in PLWH. The latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment guidelines for sexually transmitted disease suggests that lumbar puncture (LP) should only be performed on those with neurological signs or symptoms, but not in PLWH presenting with no neurological symptoms.[1] While the investigation of individuals with neurological symptoms is well established, there are more controversies around PLWH with potential asymptomatic neurosyphilis. The incidence of asymptomatic neurosyphilis remains high in PLWH,[2] but the exact clinical circumstances dictating when an LP should be performed in PLWH who may be asymptomatic is still unclear. A previous study showed that LP was performed in 46 PLWH patients, of whom ten patients (22%) with asymptomatic neurosyphilis were detected during early infection.[3] Another study analyzed data for 117 PLWH with CSF abnormalities consistent with neurosyphilis, and approximately 33% were asymptomatic.[4] Owing to the relatively high rate of asymptomatic neurosyphilis in PLWH, the criteria of LP application should be expanded to exclude asymptomatic neurosyphilis, considering potentially serious complications of late neurosyphilis (42.1% showing infarction lesions, 47.4% mild-to-severe brain atrophy, and 15.8% white matter demyelination after treatment).[5] The CD4+ T cell count <350 cells/mL and/or VDRL titer ≥1:32 was the most reliable in identifying asymptomatic neurosyphilis in PLWH (sensitivity: 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 70–100]; specificity: 87% [95% CI: 72–96]).[3] The European guidelines suggested that PLWH may have an increased risk of neurological involvement and recommend CSF examination in all patients with VDRL titers >1:32 and CD4+ T cell count <350 cells/mL.[6] In addition, a retrospective cohort showed that repeat syphilis is more likely to present asymptomatically than initial syphilis in HIV-infected individuals, which should also be verified by LP.[7] Although asymptomatic neurosyphilis can only be diagnosed by CSF examination, several risk factors are also associated with asymptomatic neurosyphilis in PLWH, including low CD4 T-cell count, high rapid plasma reagin titer, and poor HIV virological control,[8] indicating that HIV could have an impact on neurosyphilis progression. However, a portion of patients who meet the criteria refuse to undergo LP in clinical practice. A Polish group who reviewed their HIV cohort from 2006 to 2010 reported that only 52 of 109 patients (47.7%) with VDRL titers ≥1:32 agreed to undergo LP, and 44 of those 52 (82.60%) cases were diagnosed with neurosyphilis.[9] Therefore, the treatment of syphilis in PLWH should be discussed further in patients who are at high risk of developing neurosyphilis. Benzathine penicillin G (BPG) has been used to treat syphilis for decades with no penicillin-resistant strains being documented thus far. Recent international treatment guidelines concur in endorsing that syphilis should be treated with the same regimen regardless of the HIV status, namely, a single-dose, long-acting intra-muscular BPG 2.4 million units (MU) in early syphilis and three doses of intra-muscular BPG 2.4 MU in late latent syphilis, including neurosyphilis.[10] However, different suggestions were given to patients with HIV coinfection because of impaired host immunity and higher rates of asymptomatic neurosyphilis. In the absence of LP, a full neurosyphilis regimen must be administered. A retrospective analysis of 130 HIV-coinfected individuals in the United Kingdom recommended the following treatment with a neuropenetrative regimen regardless of syphilis stage: 17 days of intra-muscular procaine benzylpenicillin (2.4 MU) and oral probenecid (500 mg, q.i.d.). This UK study identified a serological treatment success rate of 98%, which was higher than that previously recorded elsewhere, and the team reported successful patient adherence to this longer course of treatment.[11] In contrast, a randomized clinical trial compared a single vs. three-dose BPG regimen in PLWH and showed that the three-dose regimen did not improve syphilis serological outcomes, which provides further support for the recent CDC recommendation.[12] In another retrospective analysis of 478 cases in the USA from 1986 to 2013, HIV-infected patients with early syphilis were treated with one dose of 2.4 MU BPG (29%), ≥2 doses of 2.4 MU BPG (53%), or other regimens including non-penicillin-based regimens (18%).[13] The study found no statistically significant difference in serologic response to treatment in HIV-infected patients receiving a single dose of BPG compared to those receiving ≥2 doses of BPG. This phenomenon might be explained by the fact that BPG does not reach effective levels in the CNS, even with the prolonged treatment course. It would be preferable to use treatments with good CNS penetration, such as ceftriaxone in all HIV-positive patients with early syphilis.[14] Given the lack of high-quality, randomized, prospective data with adequate follow-up periods, it is challenging to derive firm conclusions about clinical outcomes. The optimal antimicrobial regimen to treat syphilis in PLWH is still unknown. Further prospective studies should recruit enough PLWH that have undergone LP to confirm the optimal regimen for neurosyphilis. Importantly, careful follow-up is essential for observing treatment response and adverse effects such as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, regardless of the regimen used. A study suggested that the incidence of Jarisch-Herxheimer after BPG treatment was higher among HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected individuals.[15] In addition, repeated courses of BPG therapy may be needed in patients who have not responded to antimicrobial treatment or syphilis reinfection. In conclusion, the criteria for LP may need to be expanded given the diagnostic difficulty of asymptomatic neurosyphilis in PLWH. A longer course of BPG and other good CNS penetrative treatment should be considered if asymptomatic neurosyphilis cannot be excluded.

      "abstract": "Neurocognitive deficits are the presenting complaint in 4% to 15% of patients diagnosed with HIV. Patients may present with nonspecific complaints such as deficits in memory, concentration, attention, and motor skills. These symptoms are common in many disorders, and accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment. The AIDS dementia complex (ADC) was first defined in 1986 and was a frequent feature of HIV disease before antiretroviral therapy (ART) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) came into common use in the mid-1990s. In addition to medical comorbidities, patients also frequently suffer from various mental or psychosocial issues that can affect cognitive function, including mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse or dependence. Increased risk of opportunistic infections, tumors, and a side effects of antiretroviral drugs may also contribute to neurologic effects. Patients can experience delirium as part of the acute HIV syndrome or develop dementia during the later stages of their disease.The spectrum of progressively more severe neurologic and cognitive symptoms (previously known as ADC) are now referred to as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and were categorized in 2007 by the United States National Institutes of Health to include three classifications. These range in severity from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) to minor neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The distinction between these levels is made by use of neuropsychological testing in addition to observation of symptomatic functional impairment. The observed impairment must not be explained by any other condition, including infection, cerebrovascular disease, or toxic encephalopathy. In practice, making a distinction between the less severe categories of disease in the acute care setting is difficult due to the necessity of neuropsychological testing. Due to the profound symptomology and functional deficits associated with HAD this diagnosis may be presumed, especially in patients with untreated or advanced stages of AIDS disease.",

      "title": "Management of Psychiatric Disorders with HIV and Dermatological Disorders",
      "abstract": "PSYCHIATRIC ASPECTS OF HIV Introduction Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is transmitted through sexual contact, blood, and through vertical transmission from mother to child during pregnancy or during breastfeeding. The immune deficiency results from decrease in CD4+ T cells as well as dysregulation of antibody production by B cells. The stages of infection include acute infection, asymptomatic infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The relationship between HIV infection and psychiatric conditions is bidirectional. Those with psychiatric disorders like depression are more prone to contracting AIDS due to risky behavior including substance abuse. Similarly, those infected by HIV are more prone to develop psychiatric problems including depression and neurocognitive disorders. An Indian study found the lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric illness in persons with HIV to be 45%.[1] The common psychiatric and neurocognitive conditions associated with HIV along with their reported prevalence are enumerated in Table 1.[2]Table 1: Psychiatric and neurocognitive conditions associated with HIVDepression Depression is the commonest psychiatric condition associated with HIV. The relation between HIV and depression is complex; depressed individuals may resort to risky behaviors like intravenous (IV) drug abuse which may predispose them to contract and transmit HIV. Depression is commoner in LGBTQ individuals and IV drug users who are more prone to contracting HIV. An individual who develops HIV may develop syndromal depression due to multiple reasons as mentioned in Box 1.[3] Depression needs to be identified and treated promptly because it may interfere with adherence to HIV treatment. It also increases the risk of suicidal behavior. About 10% of HIV positive individuals die by suicide and about 20% resort to self-harm.[3] One Indian study reported 40% prevalence of depression among HIV-positive patients out of which 14% harbored suicidal ideas.[1] Assessment and management Depression poses a diagnostic challenge in patients with HIV as it often presents with multiple somatic complaints rather than classical cognitive symptoms. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 is a useful screening tool for depression in these individuals. Major depressive disorder (MDD) must be differentiated from normal sadness, delirium, substance intoxication or withdrawal, opportunistic CNS infection (cryptococcal meningitis and toxoplasmosis) and dementia. Effect of drugs as mentioned in Box 1 needs to be ruled out.Box 1: Causes of depression in HIVOnce the diagnosis of depression is confirmed, it needs to be treated promptly. Both tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been found to be effective in treating depression associated with HIV. However, SSRIs are considered first in line due to relatively better side effect profile. Fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline have been found to be effective in open label trials. Fluoxetine has also been found effective in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline have significant drug interactions with protease inhibitors and ritonavir. Hence, these agents should be used together with caution. Escitalopram and citalopram stand out as the safest SSRIs in terms of interaction with antiretrovirals. Testosterone has been found effective in treatment of depression in HIV patients with low testosterone levels. Stimulants like methylphenidate have also been found to be effective in treating depression, especially in those with overlapping symptoms of fatigue. Overall, treatment of HIV with antiretroviral regimen has also been found to improve depression to some extent. While using psychotropics on patients receiving retroviral medications, the drug interactions between retroviral medications and psychotropics [Table 2].Table 2: Classification of psychocutaneous disorders proposed by Koo and Lee[13]HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a term which describes the complete range of neurocognitive disorders caused by HIV from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment to HIV associated dementia (HAD).[4] Although the specific symptoms vary from person to person, the entire cluster of symptoms are often described under the umbrella term of \"AIDS Dementia Complex\" (ADC). ADC typically occurs when CD4 cells count falls to less than 200 cells/ml. According to the Frascati criteria [Box 2], HAND is classified into three categories based on degree of impairment: asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD).[4] The broad outlines of the Frascati criteria are mentioned in Box 2. The prevalence of HAND and its subtypes has been mentioned in Table 1. In an Indian study, among patients with advanced HIV, 56% were found to meet the criterion for impairment in two cognitive domains.[5] In another Indian study which examined neurocognitive deficits in early stages of HIV, seropositive patients performed poorly in digit symbol substitution test, trail making test, and controlled word association test in comparison to normal controls.[6]Box 2: Frascati Criteria[4]Assessment and management Early signs of HAND include deficits in psychomotor function (e.g., slowing of movements, gait coordination difficulties), impaired working memory, and mental flexibility. Episodic memory, particularly prospective memory, is most commonly affected. Language is often well preserved. Montreal Cognitive Assessment instrument can be used to assess cognitive deficits in HIV patients. A score of less than 26 necessitates referral for detailed neuropsychological evaluation. The Modified HIV Dementia Scale has been shown as a reliable and valid instrument for serial assessment of cognitive functions in HIV patients. Risk factors commonly associated with HAD are female sex, being elderly, higher HIV viral titers, lower socioeconomic group, substance abuse, and iron-deficiency anemia.[7] Well-planned and optimized Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) regimen is the best possible method of managing HAND and lowering the risk of progression to HAD. There is no clear-cut evidence regarding the superiority of agents with greater CNS penetration like abacavir. Stimulant medications like methylphenidate have shown benefit in some studies and no improvement in others. Physical activity may be an important measure for reducing HAND.[8] Substance misuse High prevalence of substance misuse (7.0%–58.3%) has been found in HIV-positive patients. An Indian study reported the prevalence of substance dependence in HIV to be 10%. Substance abuse has been associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment along with depression which further worsens the prognosis. The diagnosis of HIV often drives a person to substance abuse due to emotional issues and at the same time, intravenous drug use increases the risk of HIV. Opioid is commonly prescribed to persons with HIV, but their illicit use is also common. Oral buprenorphine is commonly prescribed to HIV patients but they often use intravenous buprenorphine illicitly. Substance abuse of all types along with any other psychiatric comorbidity must be aggressively treated because it affects long-term adherence to HAART and overall outcome in persons with HIV. Anxiety disorders HIV-positive patients report high levels of anxiety symptoms (4.3%–44.4%) [Table 1]. An Indian study found anxiety symptoms in 36% of HIV-positive individuals. A diagnosis of HIV commonly triggers anxiety because the individual perceives this as a condition with no cure. The anxiety begins even before the HIV test results are known. It persists afterwards even if the result is negative. Receiving notification of HIV-seropositive status can be a traumatic experience; it often leads to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and suicide ideation. Anxiety can be a reaction to many stressful events that emerge during the course of HIV disease. Stress can be caused just after knowing one's HIV-positive status, side effects arising out of treatment, and adjustment to a completely new way of life. Stigma and fear of social isolation make HIV-positive individuals more vulnerable to anxiety. Among the anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the commonest. An Indian study found the prevalence of GAD in HIV-positive individuals to be 12%. Just like depression, anxiety can adversely affect adherence to medication. It also leads to substance misuse. Anxiety regarding death due to the illness (death anxiety) is also common. Among the treatment modalities, both pharmacological and psychosocial modalities have been found to be effective. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) have been found to be effective. SSRIs, mainly fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline have been found to be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety in people with HIV.[9] Adjustment disorders Adjustment disorder affects around 30% of individuals with HIV. Adjustment disorder can be with depressive or anxiety reaction or a combination of both. It occurs commonly at the time of diagnosis of HIV. Worsening of the medical disorders during the course of the illness may also give rise to adjustment disorders. Treatment of adjustment disorder is primarily based on cognitive-behavioral or supportive psychotherapy. Antidepressants, mainly SSRIs, may also be used for short term. Psychosis Psychosis of newer onset is found among 6%–17% of HIV-affected individuals. Delusions occur more commonly than hallucinations. Impairment of attention and concentration, and poverty of speech are also found in first episode psychosis in HIV patients. Psychosis occurs most commonly in patients with advanced HIV infection and severe immunosuppression.[10] Psychosis increases mortality in HIV patients. Hence, early treatment is necessary. Risperidone has been found to be effective with minimal side effects in HIV patients with psychosis. One must be cautious about drug interactions with antiretrovirals. Risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole levels may be increased during concomitant administration with ritonavir and protease inhibitors due to inhibition of metabolism of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Efavirenz, nevirapine and zidovudine are known to cause psychosis-like manifestations as adverse effects. Bipolar disorder Reported prevalence of bipolar disorder in HIV-positive individuals is 1.5%. Patients with bipolar mania may be at higher risk for HIV infection because of impulsivity, high-risk behavior like multiple unprotected sexual acts or intravenous drug abuse. Mania in later part of HIV infection may be associated with HAD.[11] Mania may also result from side effects of antiretroviral medications such as zidovudine and lamivudine, direct effects of HIV infection on the CNS, CNS opportunistic infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis) and CNS tumors like non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Manic episodes in HIV patients should be treated promptly to reduce the chances of spread to other people due to their high libido and poor judgment. Sodium valproate is the preferred mood stabilizer for treating mania in HIV patients. Liver function has to be monitored periodically. Lithium should be avoided because of chances of developing toxicity following HIV nephropathy. Likewise, carbamazepine is contraindicated because of increased chances of developing pancytopenia. Personality traits and disorders Patients with HIV have high prevalence of personality disorders. Compared to a general population rate of 10%, the prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is 19%–36% and HIV at risk individuals is 15%–20%.[12] The commonest type of personality encountered in these individuals is antisocial personality disorder and the risk of substance abuse and high risk sexual behavior is significantly greater in this population. However, it is more convenient to assess the personality of HIV-positive individuals along the dimensions of stable–unstable and introvert–extrovert, not only to reduce stigma but also for the purpose of clinical utility.[12] Unstable extroverts are the types which are most likely to engage in high-risk behaviors frequently, leading to HIV infection and subsequent spread to others. They are the ones who are less likely to adhere to treatment and stick to advice of the clinician. Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and NEO Five-Factor Inventory (FFI) are some of the instruments which may be useful in assessing personality in these groups of patients. Some of the effective techniques in dealing with these individuals include focusing on thoughts and not emotions, behavioral contract, emphasizing constructive rewards, using relapse prevention techniques, and coordinating with medical care services. Delirium Delirium occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of hospitalized AIDS patients.[2] Delirium in HIV patients is characterized by disturbance of attention and awareness along with disturbance in cognition which develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate in severity during the day. Patients with HAD and in advanced stages of HIV have the highest risk for developing delirium. Other general risk factors include advanced age, polypharmacy, and medical problems. The mainstay of management is finding out the cause and correcting it. Previously, common causes of delirium included atypical CNS and systemic bacterial infection with Cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium, fungal infections, and hypoxia with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. With the widespread use of HAART, delirium is more commonly associated with polypharmacy, HIV-related cerebrovascular disease, and psychoactive drug withdrawal or intoxication. Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale are the preferred assessment tools. Delirium in HIV/AIDS is managed by trying to find out the underlying cause and correcting it. Then attempt is made to reorient the patient through environmental cues. Pharmacotherapy may be initiated for symptomatic relief. The most favored antipsychotic has been low-dose haloperidol. Among the second-generation antipsychotics risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine are effective in resolving delirium symptoms. PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT OF DERMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS (PSYCHOCUTANEOUS DISORDERS/PSYCHODERMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS) Introduction Disorders of the brain and skin are closely linked to one another. Disorders of skin leading to change in looks and disfigurement can lead to various emotional problems. Similarly, various psychiatric issues can have dermatological signatures in the form of visible injuries or lesions. About 30% to 40% of patients seeking dermatology consultation have an underlying psychiatric issue. Classification The most widely accepted classification of psychocutaneous disorders is the one proposed by Koo and Lee[13] [Table 3]. They categorized these disorders into mainly 3 types: (1) psychophysiologic disorders, (2) primary psychocutaneous disorders, and (3) secondary psychocutaneous disorders.[13]Table 3: Interaction between Psychotropic and Antiretroviral DrugsThe classification also includes \"cutaneous sensory disorders\" which includes unpleasant skin sensations with no known dermatological cause but probable psychiatric etiology. Another category mentions psychotropic medications which may be helpful for management of dermatological conditions. For example, doxepin may be more helpful than standard dermatological agents for management of pruritus. Recent Classification of Psychodermatological Disorders[14] Group A, Primary Psychodermatological Disease: Here, the primary dermatological disorders have a psychological mechanism, a psychological stress, and/or psychopathology as main elements in terms of either for induction or for worsening of the same. For example: psoriasis, alopecia areata, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria. Group B, Primary Psychodermatological Illness: In this group of dermatological conditions, there are skin symptoms, either with or without secondary self-induced skin lesions (such as excoriations), in the absence of a primary dermatosis. For example: Psychogenic pruritus, delusional infestation, self-inflicted skin lesions, body dysmorphic disorder, dysesthesias like burning mouth syndrome, vulvodynia. Group C, Secondary Psychodermatological Disorder: In this group, psychiatric complications of medications prescribed in dermatology and dermatological consequences of psychotropics are included: Secondary dermatologic disease related to psychiatric medications [Tables 4 and 5] Secondary psychiatric illness related to dermatologic medications. Common examples: Depersonalization: minocycline Mood disorders: isotretinoin; methotrexate; systemic steroids Psychoses: dapsone; hydroxychloroquine Sedation and drowsiness: antihistamines Table 4: Dermatologically Adverse Effects of Psychotropic MedicationsTable 5: Severe Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions with PsychotropicsBasic outlines of psychiatric assessment of dermatological patient The basic approach to interviewing a patient referred from dermatology should follow some of the basic techniques as outlined in Box 3.[15] For patients requiring psychodermatological evaluation, a liaison clinic comprising of a psychiatrist, a dermatologist, and a clinical psychologist is the most preferred set up. This is followed in Kasturba Medical College, Manipal in India.[16] However, due to dearth of specialists, such a composite set up may not be possible across the country.Box 3: Basic Techniques for Psychiatric Assessment of Dermatological Patient1. Psychophysiological Disorders Psychophysiological disorders are those dermatological conditions where psychological issues have a major influence in the course of the disorder. Stressful life events often cause flare ups of skin lesions. As many as 50% patients with acne and almost 100% patients with hyperhidrosis report emotional triggers.[17] An Indian study reported stressful life events in 26% of patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 16% of patients with chronic urticaria within one year preceding onset or exacerbation of the skin conditions.[18] Excessive workload, failure or poor performance in exam/interview, job loss, separation, break up of romantic relationship, or any kind of stress, anxiety, or other psychological issues generally precipitate or exaggerate dermatological disorders like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, acne, and hyperhidrosis. Management Identification of the stress factors is of utmost importance for controlling these psychophysiological disorders. Stress management by lifestyle modification like time management, adequate sleep, balanced or healthy diet, yoga, meditation, deep breathing, deep muscle relaxation or other way of relaxation might help in managing stress and increase resilience. Pharmacological management with SSRIs and short course of benzodiazepines has been beneficial when only non-pharmacological management is not helpful. 2. Primary Psychiatric Disorders This is the most important area where a psychiatrist plays a primary role in the management of psychocutaneous disorders. In this category, the core problem is in the psyche or brain which leads to dermatological disorders like skin picking disorder or any other body focus repetitive behaviors, delusional parasitosis, body dysmorphic disorder, etc. A few important primary psychocutaneous disorders are: 2.1. Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) These are repetitive behaviors directed at the body in which the patient is unable to control the act despite negative consequences. The salient features are: Repetitive self-grooming behavior like pulling, picking-scraping or biting own hair, skin, or nails Causes damage to the body area Multiple attempts to stop or decrease the behavior but failed Causes significant distress or impairment of functioning Disorder is not due to intake of substance or any other medical, dermatological, or psychiatric disorders Different conditions come under this umbrella term, as follows: Hair pulling disorder (HPD) – Trichotillomania Skin picking disorder (SPD) – Dermatillomania/Skin excoriation Nail biting (onychophagia)/nail picking (onychotillomania) Tongue chewing Lip biting/cheek biting Nose picking Epidemiology Although large-scale epidemiological studies are lacking, there are a few small-scale studies of skin picking disorder and trichotillomania. It has been seen that about 3% of general populations have any kind of BFRBs. Although in childhood both girls and boys are equally affected, in adolescence and adulthood, women are affected much more than men (6 to 9:1).[19] Phenomenologically where do they fit in psychiatry? BFRBs have many features that may match with many psychiatric disorders. Although DSM-5 describes skin picking disorder (SPD) and hair pulling disorder (HPD) as obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and related disorders, there is still debate whether they are related to OCD or they fit into an independent category. ICD 11 has categorized these cluster of conditions as a separate category of BFRBs. Management Interdisciplinary approach (dermatologist–psychiatrist liaison) is the key in managing this type of conditions. Diagnosis should be done after exclusion of other similar disorders. As comorbidities are very high, psychiatrist should address the comorbidities like depression, anxiety, personality disorders for maximum benefits and reduction of relapse. BFRBs do not respond easily to treatment. Psychological therapy Habit reversal training (HRT) and stimulus control are psychological treatment methods of choice for this group of disorders. Habit Reversal Therapy (HRT): Primary treatment for HPD and other BFRBs. Here people learn how to recognize situations where they are likely to pull their hair and how to substitute other behaviors instead. Components in HRT: Relaxation training is also an integral part of HRT. Awareness training/self-monitoring: In the first two to three sessions, the person learns to recognize triggers and premonitory symptoms. Competence behavior: Replace pulling, picking behavior with other adaptive behavior like, clenching the fists to help stop the urge or redirect one's hand from their hair to the ears in HPD or squeezing a rubber ball in case of SPD. Generalization of behavior: Practicing new learned skills in different situations. Stimulus Control: Modify the environment to reduce opportunities to pull or pick. Generally, persons do the act while alone so they are advised to keep the door open while doing work; persons can also cover their scalp with scarf, cap and wear gloves, or strapping fingers so that they become unable to pull or pick. Cognitive restructuring: Cognitive therapy helps to identify and examine distorted beliefs people may have in relation to hair pulling and skin picking, and replace those maladaptive thoughts with adaptive thoughts. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): This helps to accept one's urges without acting on them. It is usually used as an adjunct to HRT/stimulus control. Drug treatment: Several medications have been tried and have shown significant results in HPD and SPD. The following medications can be used: N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a glutamate modulator, has shown promising results for treatment of both HPD and SPD. N-acetylcysteine promotes the body's production of glutathione, a critical antioxidant, and thus plays a significant role in countering cellular inflammation. Based on evidences a trial of 1200–2400 mg/day for at least three months is recommended as it is safe, well tolerated and effective in all severity levels. SSRI/Clomipramine- SSRIs are considered first-line treatment in BFRB though meta-analyses have not revealed significant benefits. Like OCD, the dose should be started low and go up to the higher therapeutic range. Clomipramine has been found to be effective in BFRBs specially in HPD. Atypical Antipsychotics: Olanzapine has been found to be effective in a meta-analysis of HPD treatments. Other antipsychotic agents, including haloperidol, risperidone, and aripiprazole have also shown some benefit in uncontrolled studies. Naltrexone (opioid antagonist: 50 mg/day): Naltrexone reduces urges to engage in pleasurable behaviors. It is best for patients reporting strong urges to pull. Lamotrigine - It has been found to be effective in HPD and SPD in open label studies. 2.2. Delusional Parasitosis (DP) In delusional parasitosis, patients have a false, firm belief that they have been infested with parasites. It is also known as delusional infestation or Ekbom syndrome. DP occurs as a single somatic delusion with no impairment of thought processes. Patients often complain of a sensation of bugs crawling on or inside the skin. Some even bring pieces of hair, skin or cloth in a matchbox as proof of the existence of the parasites. This has been named as \"matchbox sign\". Patients may try to get rid of the parasites by using needles, fingernails and this often leads to bruises and excoriations. DP can be classified into primary, secondary, and organic forms. In primary DP, the patient has the delusion of being infested with parasites without any other psychiatric or organic disorders. Secondary DP occurs secondary to other psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, severe depression with psychotic symptoms and dementia. Organic DP occurs secondary to general medical conditions like hypothyroidism, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, hepatitis, diabetes, and HIV. Treatment Treatment strategies include pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapeutic methods. A good doctor–patient therapeutic relationship is key to effective treatment. Patient's belief should not be challenged in the initial encounter. Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, amisulpride) are now recommended due to better response and a favorable side-effect profile than first generation antipsychotics. Pimozide, which was classically used, has fallen out of favor due to cardiac side effects. 2.3 Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) Prior to DSM-5, BDD had been categorized under somatoform disorder, but now, in DSM-5, it is included in OCRD group. Here the individual is preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in his or her physical appearance which the individual believes looks ugly, unattractive, abnormal or deformed. The defect does not seem to be a matter of concern for others. The individual usually performs repetitive behaviors like checking, grooming or reassurance-seeking in response to concerns with appearance. BDD is associated with social anxiety, avoidance, depressed mood, perfectionism, and low self-esteem. It can even lead to suicidality, especially in adolescents.[20] The most common age of onset of BDD is ages 12–13 years with equal gender distribution. Most of the individuals consult dermatologists, cosmetic surgeons, or maxillofacial surgeons to correct perceived defects in their appearance. Such interventions do not lead to improvement and often contribute to poorer outcome. Management BDD is chronic, but responds favorably to treatment. However, initiating treatment may be difficult as people with BDD may not believe that their excessive fixation on perceived flaws is a psychological disorder. An empathic understanding and establishment of a good therapeutic relationship is crucial in managing BDD. CBT is effective for treating BDD. The main step is cognitive restructuring by challenging irrational beliefs and perceptions regarding body features. SSRIs are the drug of choice in BDD. Clomipramine is another drug which has shown good results. SSRI combined with CBT produces favorable treatment outcomes. 2.4 Psychogenic Pruritus In this disorder, stress precipitates episodes of itching. Itching is often triggered by emotional cues; sometimes there is nocturnal variation as well. There is localized or generalized chronic pruritus for more than six weeks in the absence of an obvious somatic cause. Emotional stress causes itching, the patient scratches the affected area to obtain relief, and further itch follows leading to a vicious cycle. Stress leads to release of histamine and other mediators of inflammation and also lowers \"itch threshold\". Psychogenic pruritus often occurs in cases of depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol abuse. SSRIs and anxiolytics may help in reducing psychogenic pruritus. Habit reversal training is also effective in these patients. 2.5 Eating Disorders Skin changes associated with eating disorders include gingivitis, lanugo hair, hyperpigmentation, cheilitis, melasma, and brittle nails and hair, among many others. The skin changes become more prominent when Body Mass Index (BMI) becomes very low (usually less than 16 kg/m2). CBT and antidepressants are the main treatment modalities. 2.6 Dermatitis artefacta (DA) It is a kind of factitious disorder produced consciously by an individual to get attention from family members and physician. Common in women (female to male ratio is 3 to 5:1). Onset is in adolescent and early adulthood. Childhood trauma, abuse, dysfunctional family, borderline personality are some associated factors. It is most commonly found in upper limbs, face and then other accessible areas. Pattern of lesions are dependent on the type of objects used and mechanism of injury and can include excoriations, superficial erosions, ulcers, abrasions, blisters, ecchymosis, purpura, erythema, edema, or signs of trauma and burns. Patients also may have multiple types of concurrent lesions and different stages of healing. Management When DA is highly suspected, it is important to avoid unnecessary lengthy, time consuming, and costly tests, and better to focus on resolving the more probable underlying psychiatric issues. Initially, direct confrontation with the patient regarding mechanism of symptoms production and diagnosis is discouraged, as the patient may deny and will be lost for follow-up. A strong rapport with the patient is essential and it will take time to establish a therapeutic relationship. Underlying psychological issues need to be identified and gradual disclosure about the cause of this problem to the patient and family member need to be done. History of trauma, family issues, depression, anxiety, cluster B personality are common in these patients. Treatment should be personalized. No large studies about pharmacological management are available. A few case reports showed that SSRIs have some beneficial effects. 2.7 Dermatitis Para Artefacta Syndrome In this condition, the patient seems to have lost control over manipulation of the skin. A minimal primary lesion is often characteristically excessively traumatized, leading to pronounced, serious clinical findings. Most common underlying psychiatric condition is impulse control disorder. 2.8 Gardner–Diamond syndrome (painful ecchymoses syndrome, psychogenic purpura, and painful bruising syndrome) Usually seen in young women, it is characterized by periodically occurring painful infiltrated blue patches, multiple physical complaints, and characteristic psychiatric symptoms. Clinical features: The condition starts with itching, tension, or burning pain, commonly in the legs. Then erythematous plaques develop with ecchymoses, which heal within one to two weeks. Usually, healing occurs periodically without scarring. Systemic symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, headache, blurred vision, paresthesia, as well as menstrual abnormalities. Psychiatric comorbidities: Dissociative disorders, anxiety and depression. 2.9. Olfactory Reference Syndrome This disorder is characterized by persistent preoccupation with the belief that one is emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odor or breath, unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. Olfactory Reference Disorder has been recognized as a distinct category in ICD 11. The affected individual repeatedly checks for smell, often tries to camouflage the smell in perfumes and often asks for reassurance from others. Treatment approach is the same as other OCRDs: high dose SSRIS or clomipramine along with CBT, although trials specific to this disorder are lacking. 3. Secondary psychocutaneous Disorder Chronic skin diseases, affecting exposed body areas, commonly lead to embarrassment, poor self-image, anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation. This is more common in the younger age group. Social impact is also huge. Often, they may have to face social isolation and discrimination and, at times, have difficulty getting jobs. Approximately 50% of acne patients report emotional stress in close association with exacerbation of acne lesions. An Indian study found psychiatric morbidity in 35% of acne patients.[21] Studies have revealed a prevalence of depression in around 30% cases of alopecia areata. Another Indian study found psychiatric morbidity in 52% of patients with chronic dermatoses. Management Generally, dermatologists refer these patients to psychiatrists when they find it difficult to keep them well, without improvement of their psychiatric conditions. Treatment of dermatological disorders, side-by-side management of psychiatric disorders to be done for optimum cure of these patients. Identification of stress, anxiety, adjustment issues and management with proper counselling, psychotherapy including CT, BT, CBT is helpful. Antidepressants like SSRI/SNRI/doxepin or hydroxyzine (if severe pruritus) are effective and a short course of BZD may be helpful during bouts of severe anxiety. Lifestyle modification and stress management are also essential 4. Cutaneous Sensory Disorders Patients complain of abnormal skin sensations (itching, burning, pain) without the presence of primary skin lesions and a negative medical work up. These sensations can occur in any body region but tends to develop in areas with greater density of epidermal innervation, most commonly involving face, scalp, or perineum.[22] Glossodynia Patients with glossodynia presented with chronic pain or burning sensations affecting the tip and sides of the tongue. There may also be changes in smell and taste. Glossodynia usually affects women in their 50s and is observed in over 5% of patients seen by dentists. The condition is usually idiopathic, but may result from vitamin B deficiencies, diabetes mellitus, candida infections, hormonal changes around menopause, and problems related to dentures or dental fillings. Higher rates of anxiety and depression are reported in patients with glossodynia.[22] Vulvodynia Vulvodynia is characterized by abnormal sensations in the vulvar region in the absence of skin lesions. The prevalence of vulvodynia is 15 percent in gynecological outpatient practices. Most women with this disorder are between 20 and 50 years of age. They also have altered pain sensation in other parts of the body. There is growing consensus that vulvodynia is a chronic pain disorder. Vulvodynia patients experience more sexual dysfunction because of this discomfort. Amitriptyline, SSRIs, venlafaxine, gabapentin and pregabalin have been found to be effective treatments. CBT and biofeedback have also been found to be effective. 5. Dermatological side effects of Psychiatric Drugs Cutaneous lesions and various dermatological side effects of psychotropic medications are summarized in Table 2. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) are potentially lethal events (10%–30% mortality) that occur rarely (2%–3% of hospitalized patients) but in a sudden and unexpected manner. Various types of SCARs are Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens–Johnson Syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reactions with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).[23] The basic identifying characteristics along with common psychotropics that may cause these reactions are summarized in Table 3. Psychiatrists should educate their patients and attendants regarding the possibilities of severe cutaneous reactions so that they are informed immediately and can take necessary measures including referral or hospitalization.

Bij kinderen met CP kunnen problemen op het gebied van visuele waarneming in het oog en/of in de hersenen gelokaliseerd zijn. Oculaire Visuele Inperking (OVI) heeft betrekking op die vormen van slechtziendheid welke samenhangen met oogheelkundige aandoeningen. Cerebrale Visuele Inperking (CVI) kan omschreven worden als een visuele stoornis als gevolg van al dan niet aantoonbare schade aan een of meerdere hersengebieden na het chiasma opticum of aan slechtziendheid waar geen oculaire verklaring voor bestaat. CVI kan veroorzaakt worden door het hypoxische-ischemisch letsel. Daarnaast kunnen prematuriteit, hydrocefalus, epilepsie en beschadigingen aan het centraal zenuwstel, CVI tot gevolg hebben. De klinische symptomen van CVI kunnen zich manifesteren in onder andere visueel sensorische symptomen, oculomotorische symptomen en hogere visuele symptomen. Een ander opvallend kenmerk is verminderde gezichtsscherpte zonder oogheelkundige verklaring. CVI kan samengaan met oogheelkundige afwijkingen zoals strabismus, optische atrofie en nystagmus. Daarnaast doen visuele problemen zich met name voor op het gebied van de hogere cognitieve processen als herkenning, orientatie, diepte-perceptie, gelijktijdige perceptie van beweging en visuele waarneming. Kinderen met CVI kunnen bijvoorbeeld moeite hebben met het vinden van de looproutes en de overgang van licht naar donker. Als gevolg van CVI kunnen functioneringsproblemen in het dagelijks leven ontstaan maar ook problemen in het gedrag en motorische ontwikkeling van kinderen. Deze problemen kunnen op verschillende manieren tot uiting komen omdat CVI samen kan voorkomen met andere problemen, zoals gedragsproblemen, epilepsie of problemen op het gebied van aandacht en concentratie.",

      "abstract": "The complexity of diagnosing cognitive impairment may be overwhelming. The diagnostic tools necessary to differentiate the causes of cognitive impairment are delineated. Most HIV-related cognitive impairment is caused by infection of the brain. Four HIV-related opportunistic conditions commonly cause cognitive impairment: toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and lymphoma. Other causes are organic affective disorders, mood disturbances that result from specific biological causes. Some cognitive impairments are transient. Five procedures used to diagnose cognitive impairments are: mental status examination, neuropsychiatric interview, neurologic examination, laboratory and radiologic testing, and neuropsychological testing. These procedures may be conducted by a psychotherapist or a primary health care provider. Psychiatrists, neurologists, and neuropsychologists can be useful resources in negotiating the diagnostic process.",

The criteria for the diagnosis have traditionally been based primarily on tests of intelligence, and this continues despite frequent challenges to the underlying assumptions. MR and corresponding termsmental sub normality and mental deficiency-refer to a heterogeneous group of conditions, most of which are genetic or chromosomal or reflect the consequences of intrauterine infection or iso immunization. Other biologic causes include anoxia at birth, other obstetric difficulties, as well as a relatively few postnatal events, such as sequelae of central nervous system infection or injury, anoxia from repeated or prolonged convulsions, and a variety of other causes including degenerative diseases (such as Tay-Sachs) and toxic encephalopathies (such as lead poisoning). A large proportion of cases of MR have, however, no known origin.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are important to both neurologists and physicians for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most significant is that neurologic complications are common. At least one-third of patients with advanced HIV disease will present with a neurologic complication, and even greater numbers of patients will have experienced one or more neurologic complication during their life with HIV disease. At autopsy, more than 80% of patients will have cerebral pathology, ranging from evidence of HIV encephalitis to opportunistic infections and lymphoma. At least half will have some evidence of a peripheral neuropathy.–These figures are evident in those countries where there is limited or no access to antiretroviral drugs as well as in those countries with full access to such drugs.",

      "abstract": "In the review, literature presents data on neurological disorders and complications after a sustained COVID-19 infection. In the initial stages of the pandemic, headache, weakness, impaired sense of smell, cognitive dysfunction were mainly recorded, then cases of ischemic strokes, thromboembolism, dementia, acute inflammation, which indicated a specific viral damage to the vessels of the brain and hemocoagulation systems, encephalopathy were registered later, demyelinating injuries, mental disorders. Many factors and mechanisms may underlie neurological manifestations, including possibly immune reactions, when the virus damages nerve and microvascular cells and induces the formation of new neuron-specific autoantigens to which autoimmune reactions develop, and inflammatory reactions that determine the clinical course of neurological disorders. Neurological and mental disorders with different manifestations occur both in patients in the acute phase of the disease, which requires inpatient treatment, as well as in a significant part of infected persons who did not require hospitalization for pneumonia and were treated on an outpatient basis, in patients who had a mild course of the disease, various complications also developed after clinical recovery, which received the name «prolonged covid syndrome» or «consequences after acute covid», «Long Covid». Dynamic follow-up of patients over 6-8 and 18 months showed that the resulting nervous disorders may partially or completely disappear, while others persist for a long time. Almost all symptoms after 18 months were detected in a smaller number of observations, but the frequency of smell and taste disorders probably only decreased, almost by 2-2.5 times, which indicates, as some that is, the gradual restoration of the functions of the nervous system and reducing neuro covid symptoms. The review analyzes in detail some of the causes and mechanisms of the development of Long Covid, special attention is paid to autoimmune reactions that are activated during Covid-19, namely antigenic mimicry, the similarity of the virus and human proteins, the cytotoxic effect of anti-covid immunoglobulins, inhibition of autoimmunity reactions. The review notes that many issues of the development of neurological disorders require further study and improvement of treatment and rehabilitation methods. Keywords: Covid 19, Long Covid, neurological manifestations and complications.",

      "abstract": "The wide usage of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leads to reduction of the occurence rate of focal or diffuse neurological damage caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which prominently improves the living quality of HIV-infected patients. Despite this progress, about 70% of HIV-infected patients develop neurological complications. Although neurological disease typically occurs in the advanced stage of the disease or after severe damage of immune functions, it may also occur during early stage of the infection. HIV-associated myelopathy is a common complication of immunodeficiency syndrome and its typical pathological appearence is vacuolar degeneration. In many patients the clinical manifestations of vacuolar myelopathy are in fact limited to non-specific sphincter or sexual dysfunction, and may remain completely asymptomatic. Even when motor and sensory symptoms become evident, the diagnosis is often complicated by a concomitant peripheral neuropathy. The purpose of this study is to summarize pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, pathological features, diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated myelopathy.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, sensory ganglioneuritis, and acute cranial nerve palsy all may occur 2 to 3 weeks after acute HIV infection. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and polyradiculopathy may occur with otherwise asymptomatic HIV virus infection. Neuropathy is one of the most common neurological manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–related complex, occurring in as many as 20% of these patients. Acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (38%) and mononeuropathy multiplex (29%) are most frequently seen, and usually there is a good prognosis, with the neuropathy resolving spontaneously or with steroids or plasmapheresis. Neuropathy occurring with AIDS is reportedly uncommon but probably is underreported, especially in seriously ill patients. By contrast with AIDS-related complex, the neuropathy associated with AIDS is usually a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (72%), with inflammatory neuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, and polyradiculopathy occurring rarely. The pathogenesis of acute or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and possibly of mononeuropathy multiplex is probably autoimmune. The pathogenesis of distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is less clearly established and may be infectious, toxic, or nutritional. Polyradiculopathy most likely is infectious; cytomegalovirus is a leading contender for infectious agent, but herpes simplex virus and HIV are other possibilities.",

It contributes to fatigue, functional impairment, and an overall reduction in the quality of life; yet, there remains considerable uncertainty about its cause and significance. Early reports of sleep-specific EEG changes related to HIV infection, in particular an increase in slow wave sleep, have not been confirmed in later controlled studies. Sleep disturbance is reported at all stages of HIV infection, but the presence of cognitive impairment or an AIDS-defining illness is a significant risk factor. Antiretroviral medications have not demonstrated a class effect, but plasma levels of the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, efavirenz, do correlate with insomnia. Amongst the recognized risk factors, the most notable is psychological morbidity which has shown a consistent and strong association with insomnia in seropositive patients. Insomnia in HIV infection is associated with a reduced quality of life, but in this population, it remains both under-recognized and under-treated. This may in part be a reflection of uncertainty about approaches to management, as there is little data on treatment of insomnia in this population. Insomnia in HIV presents a considerable challenge for the clinician and requires careful evaluation, in particular screening for anxiety and depression, and a familiarity with non-pharmacological interventions as well as drug treatments for sleep disturbance.",

This article relates to the so-called type C HE: that is, HE in patients with liver cirrhosis. It manifests as a wide spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations, detectable only by neuropsychological or neurophysiological assessment, to coma. Several scales have been developed for grading the extent of HE. The most often used is the West Haven criteria (WHC), which differentiate between four grades of clinically overt HE. Patients with liver cirrhosis without clinically overt symptoms of HE but neuropsychological or neurophysiological findings indicating brain dysfunction are considered to have minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). For simplification, some experts suggest differentiating between covert HE (MHE plus grade I HE according to WHC) and overt HE (WHC grades II–IV). Diagnosis of both MHE and overt HE is hampered by the fact that none of the symptoms of HE or the findings in the various diagnostic measures applied are specific. Thus, a diagnosis of HE or MHE can only be made after exclusion of other possible causes of brain dysfunction.",

We provide an update on the diagnosis and critical care management of adult patients with neurological complications of COVID-19.Large prospective multicentre studies conducted in the adult population over the last 18 months improved current knowledge on severe neurological complications of COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients presenting with neurological symptoms, a multimodal diagnostic workup (including CSF analysis, brain MRI, and EEG) may identify different syndromes associated with distinct trajectories and outcomes. Acute encephalopathy, which represents the most common neurological presentation of COVID-19, is associated with hypoxemia, toxic/metabolic derangements, and systemic inflammation. Other less frequent complications include cerebrovascular events, acute inflammatory syndromes, and seizures, which may be linked to more complex pathophysiological processes. Neuroimaging findings include infarction, haemorrhagic stroke, encephalitis, microhaemorrhages and leukoencephalopathy. In the absence of structural brain injury, prolonged unconsciousness is usually fully reversible, warranting a cautious approach for prognostication. Advanced quantitative MRI may provide useful insights into the extent and pathophysiology of the consequences of COVID-19 infection including atrophy and functional imaging changes in the chronic phase.Our review highlights the importance of a multimodal approach for the accurate diagnosis and management of complications of COVID-19, both at the acute phase and in the long-term.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations: Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase (Elaprase®), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. Genetic counseling MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

Segun el area danada, se alteraran diferentes funciones visuales, como el campo visual, percepcion del movimiento, control de la escena visual compleja, control de los movimientos corporales guiados por la vision, la atencion visual, el comportamiento influenciado por un entorno complejo y el reconocimiento de una imagen. La etiologia de la disfuncion es variada, pero esta intimamente ligado con la prematuridad. Los principales mecanismos que pueden provocar la disfuncion visual cerebral son el sindrome hemorragico-isquemico, lesiones neurologicas focales, traumatismos, hidrocefalia, infecciones, hipoglucemias neonatales, metabolopatias, malformaciones cerebrales, cromosomopatias y epilepsia. El diagnostico de esta entidad es dificil, y en muchos casos, de exclusion. Ademas de evaluar la agudeza visual, la campimetria, la sensibilidad al contraste, la motilidad ocular, la estereopsis y la morfologia del polo anterior y posterior del ojo, contamos con unos cuestionarios especialmente disenados para identificar la disfuncion visual cerebral. En nuestro estudio hemos estudiado una poblacion de nacidos pretermino a la edad de 5 anos y, tras una exploracion oftalmologica completa, hemos realizado el cuestionario a los cuidadores de los pacientes a fin de identificar una posible disfuncion visual cerebral y, a la vez, poder aconsejar ciertas medidas rehabilitadores a fin de mejorar la calidad de vida de estos pacientes.",

For many individuals, the psychiatric condition is a preexisting one, predisposing to HIV infection through behavioral factors and risk environment. The risk factors for HIV are well established and involve blood/bodily fluid contact with infected individuals: unprotected sexual behaviors, needle sharing, multiple sexual partners, and fetal/natal exposure. Individuals with preexisting psychiatric illness often engage in risky behaviors with little thought or fear of consequences. This relates to increased emotional immaturity and impulsivity, poor contact with reality, denial and disinhibition, cognitive dysfunction, active thoughts of self-harm, and victimization or impaired judgment. Barriers to treatment, such as distrust of authority, poor communication skills, limited access, lack of motivation, and unstructured lifestyle, result in poor overall health care and delayed diagnosis of all health issues. Diagnosis of mental health issues is frequently challenging, and adherence to treatment is frequently impacted by these same factors.",

There are several neuropathic pain syndromes associated with the disease; however, the most common is a sensory neuropathy called HIV sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN). HIV-SN can be subdivided into subacute or chronic distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) and subacute antiretroviral-induced toxic neuropathy (ATN). Both forms involve sensory loss and neuropathic pain. DSP occurs in up to 7–35% of HIV1-infected individuals and upwards of 34% of children infected with HIV1, while ATN develops following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment in up to 52% of patients. The mechanisms of HIV-SN remain unclear; however, the advent of several models of HIV1-associated peripheral neuropathy is helping unlock the mysteries surrounding HIV-SN. This chapter describes the known pathology of HIV1 and the resulting neuropathy syndromes, including descriptions of the models used to study this particular type of neuropathic pain.",

CSF studies were normal and serology for Toxoplasma and Cytomegalovirus were negative. ELISA for HIV was positive by two different kits. Infection of the central nervous system with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with cognitive impairment that ranges from mild cognitive and motor difficulties to dementia. The most common abnormalities on MRI of brain include white matter signal hyperintensities and atrophy. HIV infection causes progressive atrophy within the gray and white matter in the brain. These changes are most severe in advanced stages of disease but are evident even in medically asymptomatic HIV-positive persons. (excerpt)",

WD is difficult to diagnose and may lead to disability and death if unrecognized. Central nervous system involvement may occur secondary to gastrointestinal or arthritic infections or as the even more obscure entity of primary WD of the brain. WD has multifarious presentations in the central nervous system from the effects of mass lesions with seizures, stroke-like phenomena, and meningoencephalitis to masquerading as almost every neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric syndrome including amnesia, rapidly progressive dementia, frontotemporal dementia, prosopagnosia, Korsakoff’s syndrome, Klüver–Bucy syndrome, Lewy body disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, limbic encephalitis, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, dementia–parkinsonism–motor neuron disease complex, and rhombencephalitis. WD must enter the differential diagnosis in the assessment of patients with the suspicion of neurodegenerative disorders, especially if magnetic resonance imaging reveals patchy nodular contrast enhancement with cerebral atrophy, particularly in the frontal and temporal regions, eye movement abnormalities, and oculomasticatory myorhythmia. Cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction for Tropheryma whipplei DNA confirms the diagnosis. If recognized early, WD of the central nervous system is treatable and curable by antibiotics providing there is a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis. Remember to always ask: could it be WD?",

Conclusion: There are several lessons taught from our case. Firstly, in patients with autoimmune disorders who are strongly immunosuppressed, the new onset of cognitive impairment and seizures should alert the treating physician to look carefully for PML. Secondly, in cases of SLE where the diagnosis of the cause of cognitive impairment and seizures is not clear, we suggest that immunosuppression should not be intensified until PML has clearly been ruled out. Lastly, multidisciplinary care in patients with suspected neuropsychiatric SLE including a neurologist, an infectious diseases consultant, a neuroradiologist, and a rheumatologist is needed.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: Neurotoxoplasmose é a infecção do SNC mais frequente em doentes portadores do VIH. Os seus sintomas podem ser défices neurológicos focais, crises epilépticas e distúrbios neuropsiquiátricos. O exame neurológico, permite identificar sinais importantes para o diagnóstico diferencial com patologia psiquiátrica e definir a melhor escolha de exames complementares de diagnóstico no serviço de urgência. A não identificação atempada desta situação pode resultar em défices permanentes ou desfecho fatal. Apresentação de caso: Trata-se de homem de 52 anos, com diagnóstico recente de infecção por VIH em contexto do falecimento de cônjuge, admitido na Urgência por cefaleia holocraniana, apatia e amnésia referenciado à Psiquiatria. Ao exame físico, constatou-se, lentificação psicomotora, hipoprosexia e diminuição do campo visual com interferência na coordenação motora e mobilização. A RM CE realizada evidenciou lesões multicêntricas, com edema e efeito de massa, descritas como tuberculose/toxoplasmose. Iniciadas medidas anti-edema necessárias e tratamento anti-toxoplasma uma vez que não foram reunidos outros dados que sustentassem a outra hipótese descrita. Teve alta autónomo, após controle clínico e imagiológico feito ao 14º dia de internamento que demonstrou melhoria considerável. Conclusão: Os meios complementares de diagnóstico solicitados em ambiente de Urgência devem ser um apoio à decisão e resultar em condutas modificadoras. A informação de infecção por VIH e os achados imagiológicos alteram o raciocínio etiológico, permitem o diagnóstico diferencial de infecções do SNC e a consecutiva adequação terapêutica. Na decisão é importante ter em conta o contexto epidemiológico, a informação clínica disponível e as directrizes da OMS que ajudam a orientar a decisão em países em vias de desenvolvimento.",

      "abstract": "Acute ataxia in childhood is often caused by toxin ingestion. With the increasing number of paediatric patients on antiretroviral medication, we observe more side-effects of these drugs. Acute ataxia is defined as unsteadiness of walking or fine motor movement of <72 hours. The most common causes are postinfectious acute cerebellar ataxia, toxin ingestion and Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, the possibility of a mass lesion must always be excluded. Reported neurological abnormalities in HIV-positive children range from 10% to 68%. A South African study found the prevalence of neurological complications to be 59%, the most common of which were HIV encephalopathy and long-tract motor signs; however, no cases of cerebellar dysfunction were documented. Ataxia rarely ocurs in an HIV-positive person, the chronic sequelae being neurocognitive impairment and polyneuropathy. Ataxia in the setting of HIV is generally secondary to an infectious, vascular or neoplastic cerebellar lesion. However, most infections are opportunistic and unlikely to occur when CD4 levels are adequate. The vascular or mass lesions are readily excluded with neuro-imaging. We report 2 cases of efavirenz toxicity that caused ataxia. We treated 2 children who presented in a 1-month period, which highlighted an important differential to consider in HIV-positive paediatric patients presenting with ataxia.",

The intersection of HIV, brain health, and mental disorders forms a critical area of study within the field of psychoneuroimmunology, which explores how the immune and nervous systems interact. Even in the era of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), many individuals living with HIV continue to experience neurocognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms, indicating that viral suppression alone is insufficient to prevent central nervous system (CNS) complications. Cognitive impairments such as memory loss, decreased attention span, and executive dysfunction fall under the umbrella of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which persist in a significant portion of patients despite virologic control. Contributing mechanisms include chronic immune activation, neuroinflammation, bloodbrain barrier disruption, and the presence of viral reservoirs within the CNS. At the same time, emotional disorders like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are prevalent among people living with HIV, often linked to both biological and psychosocial factors. These conditions not only reduce quality of life but also affect treatment adherence and immune recovery.",

      "abstract": "Introduction HIV-infection is a very stigmatized, chronic disease with increased rates of psychiatric disorders, being major depression the most common. Objective To review the recent research related to depression in HIV-infected patients. Methods Literature review based on PubMed/Medline, using the keywords “HIV” and “depression”. Results HIV-infected patients have a chance 2-7 times higher of developing major depression, around the time of diagnosis or during the course of their illness. However, only fewer than 50% of the cases are recognized clinically. Several factors contribute to its under-recognition and under-treatment, such as the overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression, the somatic symptoms of HIV disease, and the effects of comorbid diseases; the mistaken belief that depressive symptoms are expected in this group; the neuropsychiatric side effects associated with some antiretrovirals. Besides, major depression presents important diagnostic challenges due to biological, psychological, and social components associated with the infection. The authors will analyze the clinical presentation. Depression has been associated with a negative impact on quality of life, poorer HAART adherence, faster HIV disease progression and increased mortality risk. Importantly, however, appropriate psychiatric intervention can do it over. In fact, studies suggest that patients receiving SSRI treatments for depression have rates of adherence and CD4 + T-cell counts similar to non-depressed patients receiving HAART. Conclusions The high prevalence of major depression in HIV-positive individuals and its serious consequences if untreated, increase even further the importance of its effective identification and subsequent treatment in this group of patients.

Benzodiazepines should be avoided in patients with cognitive impairment and delirium. Delirium is common among hospitalized HIV/AIDS patients. Most studies documenting rates of delirium were conducted in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era and were restricted to subsets of patients seen in psychiatric consultation. Sleep disorders, primarily insomnia disorders, are prevalent in the HIV-infected population. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is increasingly recognized as a significant comorbid condition that affects the clinical outcome of patients with substance abuse disorders and HIV disease. Fatigue is common among patients with HIV/AIDS and may contribute to impairment in physical function and disability. With the advent of nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (e.g., zidovudine), nonnucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (e.g., efavirenz), and PIs (e.g., indinavir) as part of HAART, there has been heightened interest in the issue of drug interactions in the context of HIV psychopharmacology.

Side effects of ART and complications of HIV infection may overlap significantly. Establishing etiology of neurologic (neuropathy and neuropathic pain, changes in cognition, dementia, and myelopathy) and psychiatric (neurocognitive disorders, depression, anxiety, substance abuse and dependence, and others) complications can present a significant challenge. It has long been documented that neurologic and psychological side effects can occur with many of the agents used to treat HIV infection. Particularly, efavirenz from the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) has been associated with neurologic and psychological complaints that may be difficult to differentiate from pre-existing mental illness, substance abuse, and HIV-related neuropsychiatric symptoms. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) of at least 6 different types is a well-known adverse effect of treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected patients.

Late-onset neuropsychiatric complications may also occur several years following the infection such as in the case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to measles. Some Infectious diseases may have possible etiological role for major psychiatric disorders, based on yet unconfirmed reports for viral infectious diseases (e.g. Influenza virus and HSV-1) which are thought to have risk for developing schizophrenia and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects can occur due to drugs (e.g. mefloquine, interferon-alpha) that are used for treatment of infectious diseases. Psychiatric symptoms can also be reactivated resulting from chronic, complicated and serious infections such as HIV that can lead to depression, anxiety or adjustment disorders, although CNS involvement can also be a possible etiological factor. Patients suffering from primary and severe psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of contracting infection; that is mainly related to high risk behaviors in patients with mania or schizophrenia. It is also important to consider that the co-occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and infection can be incidental (i.e. infectious diseases can occur in psychiatric patients regardless of the above mentioned factors). Early identification of the underlying etiology for organic/secondary psychiatric symptoms is essential for appropriate intervention and early treatment of the primary condition that could be the etiology of psychiatric symptoms so as to avoid unnecessary long-term psychiatric treatment and to avoid complications of possible misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of the primary condition.",

The precise mechanism of this direct neurotoxicity is not known, nor have the frequency, clinical course, or methods of early diagnosis been clearly established; however, a critique of 56 clinical reviews or case reports regarding approximately 800 subjects suggest that at some point following infection an HIV-induced dementia is extremely common, as are marked histopathological changes throughout the CNS.

The most severe forms of post-infectious encephalitis include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis. ADEM is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the CNS. It typically follows a minor infection with a 2–30 days latency period and is thought to be immune-mediated. It is clinically characterized by the acute onset of focal neurological signs and encephalopathy. Patients can require intensive care unit admission because of coma, seizures or tetraplegia. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis usually shows lymphocytic pleocytosis but, unlike viral or bacterial encephalitis, no evidence of direct CNS infection is found. There are no biologic markers of the disease and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging is essential to diagnosis, detecting diffuse or multifocal asymmetrical lesions throughout the white matter on T2- and FLAIR-weighted sequences. High-dose intravenous steroids are accepted as first-line therapy and beneficial effects of plasma exchanges and intravenous immunoglobulins have also been reported. Outcome of ADEM is usually favorable but recurrent or multiphasic forms have been described.",

      "abstract": "La patogénesis de la hipertensión intracraneal idiopática (HII) involucra factores hormonales, inmunes, metabólicos y vasculares1-4. Esta entidad poco común afecta frecuentemente a mujeres jóvenes con exceso de peso, y provoca dolor de cabeza, cambios visuales y de estabilidad o cognitivos, ansiedad y depresión; y puede seguir a la infección por COVID-19 o a las vacunas1-4. Además de la IIH, el virus SARS-CoV-2 se asocia con accidente cerebrovascular, deterioro de la conciencia, papiloflebitis, neuritis óptica y otras neuropatías craneales diversas1-4. También son dignas de mención las complicaciones neurooftálmicas tras las vacunas COVID-19, como ejemplos de trombosis cerebral arterial o venosa, hemorragia intracerebral, neuropatía óptica isquémica anterior bilateral y neuropatía craneal posvacunación2. Las herramientas obligatorias son el examen neurológico preciso, la resonancia magnética del cerebro, la evaluación de la presión del líquido cefalorraquídeo y las determinaciones de laboratorio. Recientemente leí el estudio de caso publicado en esta Revista por Therán León JS, et al. sobre una mujer de 26 años con infección por SARS-CoV-2 y HII, que presentó cefalea, discapacidad visual y papiledema, los cuales fueron manejados exitosamente4. La resonancia magnética (RM) de cráneo fue normal y la punción lumbar reveló líquido cefalorraquídeo normal, pero la presión era alta (40 cm H2O); sus síntomas se aliviaron con punción lumbar y 500 mg de acetazolamida 2 veces al día4. Los autores comentaron sobre el bloqueo de los vasos linfáticos por parte del SARS-CoV-2, que aumenta la resistencia a la salida del LCR y provoca HII, y las células endoteliales capilares que expresan el receptor ACE2 del virus, lo que podría favorecer su naturaleza neuroinvasiva4. En este sentido, parece útil añadir algunos comentarios sobre otros artículos muy recientes1-3. Carazo-Barrios L, et al. evaluó la evolución del dolor de cabeza, la ansiedad y la depresión entre 112 pacientes con HII durante la pandemia de COVID-19 (92% mujeres) con una edad promedio de 36,6 ± 9,2 años, un tiempo medio desde el diagnóstico de 6,25 ± 5,66 años, y detectó un empeoramiento significativo de la ansiedad y la depresión debido al encierro1. En cuanto al tratamiento de la HII, se observó un incremento de una escala de no tratamiento a medicación oral o a procedimiento quirúrgico en el 12,5% de los casos durante el confinamiento; y los autores sugirieron estudios sobre el impacto a mediano y largo plazo en los casos de HII1. Feizi M, et al. revisaron los trastornos neurooftálmicos relacionados con la infección y la vacunación por COVID-19, que pueden ocurrir hasta en un 30% de los casos, principalmente con infección grave2. Los cambios incluyeron encefalomielitis aguda diseminada, ageusia, anosmia, alteración de la conciencia, trombosis venosa cerebral, enfermedad asociada a la glicoproteína de oligodendrocitos de mielina, neuromielitis óptica, encefalopatía posterior reversible, además de los accidentes cerebrovasculares2. El mecanismo implica tormenta de citoquinas, génesis retardada de autoanticuerpos, invasión directa, disfunción endotelial, hipercoagulación, hipoxia y menor tolerancia inmune2. Thakur S, et al. reportaron una mujer de 49 años que recibió una dosis única de la vacuna aproximadamente cuatro meses antes, y presentó hipertensión intracraneal que le provocó visión borrosa; y debido a la positividad de su prueba rápida de antígeno SARS-CoV-2, fue ingresada en la sala de aislamiento y luego se sometió a una cirugía óptica endoscópica3. Como los dolores de cabeza persistentes en COVID 19 pueden presagiar una HII, que es una complicación inusual, los autores destacaron el papel de un diagnóstico precoz y un tratamiento oportuno de estos casos desde la atención primaria, con el objetivo de evitar una evolución de daño visual irreversible3. El autor cree firmemente que los comentarios aquí incluidos podrían aumentar el interés y la conciencia de los lectores sobre la hipótesis de un trastorno del sistema nervioso central relacionado con la infección o la vacunación por COVID-19, favoreciendo el diagnóstico precoz.",

Approximately one half of all HIV-infected patients will develop clinically significant neurologic disease, and the frequency with which neuropathologic abnormalities are detected at autopsy in some series exceeds 90%, suggesting that neurologic findings are often overlooked. Not surprisingly, careful neurologic examination, even in the absence of specific complaints by the HIV-infected patient, often reveals evidence of central or peripheral nervous system dysfunction. Although neurologic disease typically occurs with advanced disease and profound immunosuppression, it may also occur during early stages of the infection. In as many as 20% of individuals, neurologic disease is the harbinger of AIDS. The spectrum of neurologic disorders that complicate HIV infection is extremely broad; any part of the neuraxis may be affected. Additionally, the complexity of evaluating the HIV-infected person with neurologic disease is increased by the relatively high frequency with which more than one disease concurrently affects the nervous system.",

      "abstract": "The peripheral nerves consist of bundles of long neuronal axons as they exit the central nervous system (CNS). Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

      "title": "The significance of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)",
      "abstract": "Long COVID is now well accepted as an ongoing post-viral syndrome resulting from infection of a single virus, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. It mirrors the post-viral fatigue syndrome, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a global debilitating illness arising mainly from sporadic geographically-specific viral outbreaks, and from community endemic infections, but also from other stressors. Core symptoms of both syndromes are post-exertional malaise (a worsening of symptoms following mental or physical activity), pervasive fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog), and sleep disturbance. Long COVID patients frequently also suffer from shortness of breath, relating to the lung involvement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is no universally accepted pathophysiology, or recognized biomarkers yet for Long COVID or indeed for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Clinical case definitions with very similar characteristics for each have been defined. Chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and disrupted energy production in the peripheral system has been confirmed in Long COVID and has been well documented in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Neuroinflammation occurs in the brain in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as shown from a small number of positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, and has now been demonstrated for Long COVID. Oxidative stress, an increase in reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and free radicals, has long been suggested as a potential cause for many of the symptoms seen in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, resulting from both activation of the brain’s immune system and dysregulation of mitochondrial function throughout the body. The brain as a high producer of energy may be particularly susceptible to oxidative stress. It has been shown in peripheral immune cells that the balanced production of proteins involved in regulation of the reactive oxygen species in mitochondria is disturbed in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Fluctuations in the chronic low level neuroinflammation during the ongoing course of Long COVID as well as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome have been proposed to cause the characteristic severe relapses in patients. This review explores oxidative stress as a likely significant contributor to the pathophysiology of Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and the mechanisms by which oxidative stress could cause the symptoms seen in both syndromes. Treatments that could mitigate oxidative stress and thereby lessen the debilitating symptoms to improve the life of patients are discussed.",

Brachial amyotrophic diplegia results in severe lower motor neuron weakness and atrophy of the upper extremities in the absence of bulbar or lower extremity involvement, pyramidal features, bowel and bladder incontinence, and sensory loss. We describe a human immunodeficiency virus–seropositive man without severe immunosuppression or prior AIDS-defining illnesses who had brachial amyotrophic diplegia. This disorder may represent one end of a spectrum of motor neuron diseases occurring with this retrovirus infection.",

      "abstract": "With the declaration of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection as a global health emergency in 2022 by the WHO and its ongoing presence, Orthopoxviruses have garnered increasing attention, including their capacity to cause neurological disease. Indeed, the mpox syndrome caused by MPXV infection is recapitulated in humans for several other Orthopoxviruses including variola (VARV, the cause of smallpox), Vaccinia (VACV), camelpox (CMPX), and cowpox (CPXV) viruses, albeit with variable disease severities. In addition to prototypic signs and symptoms of orthopoxvirus infections, such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, malaise, and skin lesions, MPXV-infected individuals also develop neurological syndromes such as headaches, myalgias, seizures, altered consciousness, and encephalopathy/encephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brains of MPXV-infected persons can display hyperintensities consistent with brain edema. Pleocytosis has also been reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from persons with MPXV infections, implying active infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, newborn rodents, or animals with severe combined immune deficiency, were found to be susceptible to MPXV infection with evidence that the virus can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the present review we highlight the current understanding of Orthopoxvirus neuropathogenesis together with germane diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The classical definition of cortical blindness in both adults and children refers to complete loss of vision, including appreciation of light and dark, loss of OKN with preservation of pupillary responses, normal eye motility and normal retina on examination. Cerebral visual impairment (CVI) is now recommended as a better term. Complete blindness is rare in these patients. Most of them have some residual vision, which it is often difficult to test because they show inattention and variability in their visual performance. Secondly, ‘cerebral’ seems to be a more appropriate term than ‘cortical’. Visual impairment is secondary to a cerebral disease from multiple causes (e.g. infection, trauma, cerebrovascular disease, etc.), involving retrochiasmatic visual pathways but not necessarily the visual cortex. According to the timing of the cerebral injury, CVI in children can be classified as congenital or acquired. The latter can be caused by meningitis, encephalitis, head trauma, hydrocephalus, or metabolic derangements. Occipital infarctions are often observed in these cases. Congenital CVI includes visual loss caused by malformations, intrauterine infections or perinatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE is the most common cause of CVI, and is often accompanied by other motor and cognitive impairment owing to the diffuse nature of this pathology.",

      "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most important opportunistic infections in AIDS. The most common manifestation of neurological CMV disease in HIV infection is retinitis followed by encephalitis, polyradiculopathy, and multifocal neuropathy. Untreated necrotizing retinitis proceeds to blindness but can readily be diagnosed by ophthalmological examination. CMV polyradiculopathy presents as subacute leg weakness, paraesthesia, and urinary retention. Untreated patients develop ascending paralysis and die within weeks. Multifocal neuropathy commonly affects the radial, ulnar, and peroneal nerves but cranial nerves may also be involved. Confusion, cranial nerve palsies, and hyperreflexia are signs of ventriculoencephalitis, whereas the presentation of diffuse micronodular encephalitis is often asymptomatic. The diagnostic approach relies on the detection of CMV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid for polyradiculopathy, encephalitis, and neuropathy. Neuroimaging can exclude other causes of encephalitis and polyradiculopathy. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir monotherapy are current medical treatment options. Intraocular administration can be used for refractory retinitis, but additional systemic prophylaxis is required to suppress extraocular disease. Ganciclovir and foscarnet have improved the prognosis of multifocal neuropathy and polyradiculopathy, but response rates for encephalitis are low. However, despite therapy survival of central nervous CMV disease is still limited to months. Recently highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has decreased the overall incidence of CMV disease in AIDS. Furthermore (HAART) has become a mainstay for CMV therapy by improving the patient's immunocompetence against CMV.",

      "abstract": "Secondary (acquired) haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammatory syndrome which can occur in the context of infection, malignancy or rheumatological disease and is associated with high mortality. Early recognition facilitates access to effective biological therapies and engage- ment with specialist MDTs which focus on managing the underlying trigger. Neurological manifestations are associated with poor prognosis but are not well described. We retrospectively reviewed 40 cases of secondary HLH in UCLH/NHNN; 25 had neurological compli- cations. Median age at onset: 36 years (range 11–79); 8 females. Causes of HLH were haematological malignancy (14), rheumatological disease (3), infection (2) and other/unknown (6). Neurological involve- ment portended higher morbidity and mortality: 21/40 ICU support; 19/40 in hospital death (15/25 and 16/25 with neurology). Neurological presentations included confusion (10) and reduced consciousness (5), headache (7), neuropathy (3) and myopathy (1). Based on symptomatology, radiological, CSF and metabolic and histological information we propose mechanistic causality of neurological manifesta- tions into: disease infiltration (13/25), metabolic (12/25), iatrogenic (2/25). The role of the cytokine storm in metabolic neurological derangement requires further investigation. We designed a minimal neurology dataset to improve prospective data collection instituted via the UK HiHASC (Hyperinflammatory and HLH Across Speciality Collaboration).

The common clinical manifestations of the disease include altered mental state, epilepsy, cranial nerve damage, paresthesia, cerebellar signs, meningitis, motor disorders, and neuropsychiatry. The most common presentation in about 75% of cases is a subacute episode of focal neurological abnormalities such as hemiplegia, personality changes, or aphasia. Imaging needs to be differentiated from multiple sclerosis, lymphoma, and metastases. We report a case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome complicated with toxoplasma encephalopathy with rapid progressive memory loss as the initial symptom and misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis.

Finally, other infectious diseases of the central nervous system, such as prion disease and cavernous sinus thrombosis, are explored in this review.",

      "abstract": "Acute ataxia in childhood is often caused by toxin ingestion. With the increasing number of paediatric patients on antiretroviral medication, we observe more side-effects of these drugs. Acute ataxia is defined as unsteadiness of walking or fine motor movement of <72 hours. The most common causes are postinfectious acute cerebellar ataxia, toxin ingestion and Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, the possibility of a mass lesion must always be excluded. Reported neurological abnormalities in HIV-positive children range from 10% to 68%. A South African study found the prevalence of neurological complications to be 59%, the most common of which were HIV encephalopathy and long-tract motor signs; however, no cases of cerebellar dysfunction were documented. Ataxia rarely ocurs in an HIV-positive person, the chronic sequelae being neurocognitive impairment and polyneuropathy. Ataxia in the setting of HIV is generally secondary to an infectious, vascular or neoplastic cerebellar lesion. However, most infections are opportunistic and unlikely to occur when CD4 levels are adequate. The vascular or mass lesions are readily excluded with neuro-imaging. We report two cases of efavirenz toxicity that caused ataxia. We treated two children who presented in a 1-month period, which highlighted an important differential to consider in HIV-positive paediatric patients presenting with ataxia.",

Patients with viral meningitis often present with acute meningitis with headache, meningismus, fever, and photophobia. Survivors of bacterial meningitis can suffer significant neurological morbidity such as cognitive deficits, hearing loss, seizures, visual impairment, and/or focal motor deficits. The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis rests with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination following lumbar puncture. If purulent meningitis is present, targeted antimicrobial therapy should be initiated based on the results of Gram staining. HCAVM can be associated with a device, post-neurosurgery, or post-traumatic CSF leak. Management of suspected HCAVM includes imaging and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapy.

      "title": "Febrile encephalopathy: challenges in management.",
      "abstract": "Acute febrile encechalopathy is a common condition leading to hospital admission in adults and children in India. CNS infections are commonest cause of nontraumatic coma in children. 1 Encephalopathy- a diffuse disease of brain that alters its structure or functionmay be caused by variety of infective, metabolic, toxic, ischemic/hypoxic, nutritional causes or trauma. In febrile illnesses, encephalopathy may result from pathogenic mechanisms affecting nervous system directly or systemic complications like hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, anemia, hepatic/ renal failure and bleeding may contribute to its pathogenesis. The physician/ intensivist is faced with the challenge of emergency management, identification of cause and its treatment not only to ensure survival but also to prevent long-term sequelae, neurological or otherwise. Few of such important clinical situations need elaborate consideration. Encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain parenchyma, presents as diffuse and/or focal neuropsychological dysfunction. From an epidemiologic and pathophysiologic perspective, encephalitis is distinct from meningitis, though on clinical evaluation the two often coexist (meningoencephalitis) with signs and symptoms of meningeal inflammation, such as photophobia, headache, or a stiff neck. Cerebritis describes the stage preceding abscess formation and implies a highly destructive bacterial infection of brain tissue, whereas acute encephalitis tends most commonly to be a viral infection with parenchymal damage ranging from mild to profound. Post monsoon Japanese Encephalitis (JE) epidemics have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, Assam and other parts of the country. JE is the single largest cause of viral encephalitis in world today. The incidence has been reported to be high among pediatric age group with high mortality (30%). 2 Persistent EEG abnormalities are common in children. Brain CT and MRI scans reveal low density areas and abnormal signal intensities in the thalamus, basal ganglia which correlate with clinical findings of tremor, rigidity and abnormal movements that are common in the acute phase of illness. Diagnosis may be established by serological tests and JE virus-specific IgM antibody or RT-PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since there is no specific anti-viral therapy for JE as of today (Ribavirin is under trial), the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. However, reducing the raised intracranial pressure and controlling convulsions may decrease the mortality and morbidity significantly. No satisfactory treatment exists for the relatively common acute arboviral encephalitides, which vary in epidemiology, mortality and morbidity, if not clinical presentation. Dengue virus encephalopathy is a rare but recognized cause of acute febrile encephalopathy in India and usually occurs in febrile stage. Neurological findings reported in association with dengue include mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies and Guillain Barre’s Syndrome. Around 1-4% of all dengue admissions have clouding of consciousness. Variety of pathological processes like hypotension, cerebral edema, microvascular or frank haemorrhage, hyponatremia and fulminant hepatic failure may interact to cause coma in some of these patients but in others where no such process is identified, isolation of dengue virus from CSF or brain tissue has endorsed the concept of dengue virus itself leading to encephalitis. 3 Clinically distinguishing these acute arboviral encephalitis from the two potentially treatable acute viral encephalitis – a) herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), which is a sporadic and lethal disease of neonates and the general population as well, and b)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently enters the central nervous system (CNS) soon after infection, and frequently produces a wide variety of neurologic, cognitive, and psychiatric complications. Although, the entire spectrum of psychiatric illnesses may be seen in individuals with HIV infection, most are probably not directly caused by the virus. Psychiatric manifestations that are the direct result of HIV infection are usually seen in the setting of HIV-associated dementia. In this paper, it is proposed that these psychiatric manifestations of HIV infection can be phenomenologically separated into positive and negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are deficit states presenting as cognitive, social, or motivational deterioration; positive symptoms are psychotic or manic states that may occur in the course of the dementing illness. It is further purposed that there is a window of vulnerability to psychosis or mania that occurs relatively early in the dementing process. Consequently, advancing dementia would be expected to be associated with remission of psychosis.",

      "title": "Neurological and developmental effects of HIV and AIDS in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "Abstract HIV‐related encephalopathy is an important problem in vertically infected children with HIV. Infected infants may manifest early, catastrophic encephalopathy, with loss of brain growth, motor abnormalities, and cognitive dysfunction. Even without evidence of AIDS, infected infants score lower than serorevertors on developmental measures, particularly language acquisition. Children with perinatal or later transfusion‐related infection generally are roughly comparable developmentally to their peers until late in their course. Symptoms similar to adult AIDS dementia complex are occasionally seen in adolescents with advanced AIDS, including dementia, bradykinesia, and spasticity. Opportunistic CNS infections such as toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy are less common in children and adolescents than in adults. Increasing evidence suggests that aggressive antiretroviral treatment may halt or even reverse encephalopathy. Neuroimaging changes may precede or follow clinical manifestations, and include early lenticulostriate vessel echogenicity on cranial ultrasound, calcifying microangiopathy on CT scan, and/or white matter lesions and central atrophy on MRI. Differential diagnosis of neurological dysfunction in an HIV‐infected infant includes the effects of maternal substance abuse, other CNS congenital infections, and other causes of early static encephalopathy. Initial entry of HIV into the nervous system occurs very early in infection. The risk of clinical HIV encephalopathy increases with very early age of infection and with high viral loads. Virus is found in microglia and brain derived macrophages, not neurons. The neuronal effect of HIV is probably indirect, with various cytokines implicated.

Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms.

Clinical phenotype, magnetic resonance imagining findings, and ancillary tests can help distinguish between CNS IDDs and mimickers (eg, infection, malignancy, genetic disease, and other systemic inflammatory disorders). Acute presentations of CNS IDD should be treated with early, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids; transition to plasmapheresis if symptoms are refractory. Emergency complications of CNS IDD include elevated intracranial pressure, seizures, neurogenic respiratory and cardiac dysfunction, autonomic dysreflexia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hypothermia, secondary infections, and complications from treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in individuals with a history of multiple concussions or other forms of repetitive brain injury. A definite diagnosis can only be made post‐mortem and it is unclear why some individuals appear more susceptible to progressive neurological symptoms following repetitive brain injury than others. CTE has become a major concern in individuals exposed to increased risk of concussion, for example, sports athletes and some military personnel, but its prevalence in such risk groups is unknown. The condition shares some molecular pathologies with other neurodegenerative disorders and it appears that repetitive concussion can initiate a degenerative process involving protein misfolding that may propagate over the brain many years after the trauma. Clinical manifestations of CTE include a wide range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. These should be treated but presently there is no disease‐modifying therapy against CTE. In contrast to most other neurodegenerative diseases, the condition is preventable. Key Concepts Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) may develop secondary to repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries. A definite diagnosis of CTE can only be made post‐mortem. CTE can be prevented but not cured – prevention and symptomatic treatment are important. Brain changes in CTE should be possible to detect and monitor using biomarkers. It is important to study risk factors for CTE – why do some individuals appear to be more susceptible to chronic and sometimes progressive symptoms following traumatic brain injury than others?",

Dementia or milder forms of cognitive impairment are important manifestations of HIV infection with important consequences. Early detection and treatment is essential to prevent progression. Fatigue and depressive Symptoms are common in HIV-infection. Depression has a significant impact on the quality of life of persons living with HIV and is associated with HIV disease progression and mortality, either poor adherence with antiretroviral regiments or risk for suicide. Personality disorder is also common in the HIV- positive population. Symptoms of anxiety are very common in this patient population under substantial stress, while major anxiety disorders appear to occur with the same frequency as in the general population. Alcohol and substance abuse disorders are common in individuals across HIV risk factors. Psychiatric disorders often predate and are independent problems that interact with HIV infection and treatment. Patients with AIDS have an elevated rate of suicide. This suicidal patients require the same psychological and social Support as other persons at risk for suicide.",

Neurological irAEs affect the peripheral nervous system and muscles more than they affect the central nervous system. Among the various subsets of peripheral neuropathies, polyradiculoneuropathy, which includes Guillain-Barre syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, stands out as the most severe form, leading to significant muscle weakness. ICIs can induce dysautonomia, including autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Autonomic neuropathy represents a neurological irAE. Neurological irAEs of neuromuscular junctions include myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Diagnosing MG or myositis independently can be challenging when they occur as irAEs. Myocarditis is sometimes observed as an irAE in patients with MG and can cause both severe heart failure and lethal arrhythmias, resulting in fatal outcomes. Anti-Kv1.4 antibodies are biomarkers of the severe form of MG and myocarditis. The administration of ICI in patients with small cell lung cancer increases the risk of LEMS. The distinction between LEMS is an irAE or a manifestation of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome is unclear as both conditions share common immunological mechanisms.",

Prema DSM-5 naziv velikog neurokognitivnogporemecaja primjereniji je od naziva demencija kod osoba sa znacajnim ostecenjem koje može biti u samo jednoj kognitivnoj domeni („Amnesticki poremecaj u DSM-IV), a koji se u DSM-5 dijagnosticira kao veliki neurokognitivni zbog drugog zdravstvenog stanja (deficit tiamina povezan s ovisnoscu o alkoholu, hipoksija, infarkt, encefalitis...). Naziv neurokognitivni ima prednost i kod osoba mlađe životne dobi kod kojih je doslo do ostecenja kognitivnog funkcioniranja nakon, primjerice, traumatske ozljede mozga ili HIV infekcije. Dok su za dijagnozu velikog neurokognitivnog poremecaja potrebni dokazi o znacajno smanjenoj kogniciji u odnosu na ranije u jednoj ili vise kognitivnih domena uz nemogucnost neovisnog obavljanja svakodnevnih aktivnosti, za dijagnozu blagog neurokognitivnog poremecaja treba biti prisutna umjereno smanjena kognicija u odnosu na ranije u jednoj ili vise kognitivnih domena koji ne ometaju neovisnost u svakodnevnim aktivnostima, ali prilikom kojih je potreban povecan napor, prilagodba ili kompenzacijske strategije.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology of ADHD and associated problems—starting points for NF interventions?",
      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by severe and age-inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the majority of patients show comorbid or associated problems from other psychiatric disorders. Also, ADHD is associated with cognitive and motivational problems as well as resting-state abnormalities, associated with impaired brain activity in distinct neuronal networks. This needs to be considered in a multimodal treatment, of which neurofeedback may be a promising component. During neurofeedback, specific brain activity is fed-back using visual or auditory signals, allowing the participants to gain control over these otherwise unaware neuronal processes. Neurofeedback may be used to directly improve underlying neuronal deficits, and/or to establish more general self-regulatory skills that may be used to compensate behavioural difficulties. The current manuscript describes pathophysiological characteristics of ADHD, heterogeneity of ADHD subtypes and gender differences, as well as frequently associated behavioural problems such as oppositional defiant/conduct or tic disorder. It is discussed how neurofeedback may be helpful as a treatment approach within these contexts.",

Although rare, catatonia and each of its subtypes have now been reported as complications of COVID-19 and therefore should be considered known to occur in both the parainfectious and postinfectious states. Diagnosis of catatonia in the context of COVID-19 should be considered when work-up for more common medical causes of encephalopathy are negative, there is no identifiable psychiatric etiology for catatonia, and there is a positive response to benzodiazepines.",

The chapter then looks at normal pressure hydrocephalus and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It also considers the cognitive complications of other neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. About half of all people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis have some degree of impaired cognitive abilities at the time of diagnosis, although these may be subtle. Many people with epilepsy also report some cognitive problems, which are often due to side effects of the medications that treat epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Dementia secondary to infectious disease, setting aside cases of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (see Chapter 17) and the cognitive–motor abnormalities frequently associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is distinctly unusual. Infectious disease as the primary cause of a dementing illness is usually a diagnosis of exclusion; lumbar puncture is often carried out in the clinical work-up of a demented patient – especially if the decline in mental status is rapidly progressive – in order to safely rule out a treatable infection (e.g. cryptococcal meningitis), unusual though this is, as the cause for a given individual's cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline. In a large experience of biopsies (approximately 5–10 per year) and autopsies (40–50 annually) carried out to establish the cause for dementia, we have rarely encountered – usually as a surprise finding – evidence of a central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory or infectious disease as the primary etiology. Such cases are, however, intriguing insofar as modern diagnostic tools can often establish an aetiological agent for the infection even when the only histopathological evidence for its existence (at autopsy) is widespread chronic inflammation of the brain and its overlying leptomeninges. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the range of known viruses and bacteria that target the CNS has widened substantially (Kennedy, 1990; Vinters et al., 1998). The availability of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tests (especially the polymerase chain reaction, PCR), by which faint traces of molecular ‘footprints’ of bacterial or viral pathogens may be detected within neural tissue, allows the safe prediction that many new associations between micro-organisms and CNS/PNS disease will be made in the coming years (Darnell, 1993; Tompkins, 1992).",

Importantly, central nervous system invasion can occur at any stage, which can lead to variable presentations of neurosyphilis. One such manifestation is meningovascular syphilis, which causes thrombosis of the cerebral vasculature, leading to stroke-like symptoms such as hemiplegia and aphasia. Young, healthy patients may present with these symptoms without any risk factors typically associated with the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular accidents. Further, patients living with HIV who present with stroke-like symptoms should have an even higher suspicion for neurosyphilis as a potential diagnosis. We present a case report of a 31-year-old male with sudden left-sided weakness and numbness who tested positive for both Treponema pallidum and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",

      "abstract": "AbstractThis chapter gives a concise overview of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), with special emphasis on clinical aspects relevant to rehabilitation professionals. AIDS is a novel form of an acquired immune deficit now known to be caused by the recently recognized Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Symptoms result from the direct effects of the virus on the immune system and the nervous system, which appear to be the primary targets. Much of the morbidity and mortality, however, is caused by opportunistic infections which occur in patients unable to mobilize the appropriate immune defenses against them. Characteristic, but previously rare, neoplasms also occur due to a failure of immune regulation. Improved medical care, however, has changed AIDS from a rapidly fatal disease to one where survival may be prolonged. The rehabilitation setting, the physical disability caused by AIDS, along with the psychosocial and economic impact of the disease on the patient have become increasingly important. Fatigue, decreased endurance, weight loss, edema, blindness and swallowing difficulties may all contribute to functional impairment. Neurological involvement is frequent and may cause dementia, hemiplegia, spastic paraparesis, painful neuropathies and proximal or distal muscle weakness. The clinical features and functional impact of these symptoms on the patient with AIDS is discussed, and the appropriate rehabilitation interventions outlined. Psychosocial and vocational issues are addressed as they pertain to the different clinical presentations.",

      "title": "Impact of direct acting antivirals (DAA) on neurologic disorders in chronic hepatitis C",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations sometimes provide the first evidence of an unknown HCV infection. These conditions develop with a variable ranging of morbidity, including: \"brain fog,\" fatigue, subtle cognitive and attention impairment, but also with more severe complications or acute presentation, like encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, stroke and peripheral nerves involvement.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for articles only in English language, that assessed the relationship between \"DAA treatment and neurologic disorders\" and after the attainment of SVR in full reports of cases that received the DAA schedule from January 2015 to December 2019. The following terms were used: \"chronic Hepatitis C,\" \"HCV,\" \"DAA,\" \"direct-acting antiviral,\" \"SVR,\" \"sustained virologic response,\" peripheral neuropathy\" and \"neurologic diseases or disorders.\"EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: HCV infection does not only involve the liver, causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but also induces extrahepatic manifestations (EHM), mainly due to a complex immune disease, that damage small and medium vessels, called \"mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis\" (MCV). This kind of mechanism generates most of the HCV-induced neurological damages. Since 2015, the availability of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) oral molecules interfering with HCV replication has completely revolutionized therapeutic options and the target population, which now includes patients aged 12 to 80 years and with advanced liver disease. Relevant was the highlighted DAA effectiveness by achievement of a sustained virologic response (SVR) in about 95% of cases, showing a great tolerability.CONCLUSIONS: This favorable effect has arisen in a wide category of patients infected by HCV, including subjects with cirrhosis and complications and/or with EHM, who showed a significant improvement of their symptoms and the disease regression. In this concise review, we examine the clinical outcomes after the introduction of the DAA for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), focusing on the neurologic disorders and concluding that there is a strong amelioration of neurologic conditions in several cases, particularly, after attaining the viral eradication with a favorable course in most treated cases.",

The majority of HIV positive patients with headaches have primary headache. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) may be encountered in an ill HIV-infected patient with headaches; typically, there will be other signs including altered mental status, abnormal neurologic exam, and/or seizure. The patient presenting to a primary practitioner complaining of a chronic daily headache (CDH) bears special consideration.",

Paraneoplastic disorders can affect any part(s) of the central (CNS) or peripheral (PNS) nervous systems (Table 17.1). Patients can be roughly grouped into those with pure or relatively pure clinical involvement of one part of the nervous system, such as cerebellar degeneration or sensory neuronopathy, and those with signs and symptoms of a diffuse and multifocal “paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis” (Dropcho, 2002; Graus et al., 2004). Several syndromes should always raise the possibility of a paraneoplastic etiology, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, subacute cerebellar degeneration, severe sensory neuronopathy, limbic encephalopathy, and opsoclonus-myoclonus. None of the clinical syndromes, however, have an absolute association with neoplasia, and each can occur in patients without tumors.",

      "abstract": "Early-stage cognitive decline occurs when an individual experiences memory loss or other cognitive impairment but does not meet the criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other dementias. After diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), approximately 5-15 % of cases progress to dementia per year. AD and many other causes of dementia are presently incurable. Early recognition of cognitive decline can allow healthcare providers to reduce the risk of disease progression. Literature is scarce on factors that can increase the incidence of cognitive decline, especially in early ages; this is further exacerbated by difficulty tracking the prevalence of mild cognitive symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in the prodromal stage of dementia and can precede the onset of cognitive impairment. The presence of NPS in cognitively normal patients or in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of progression along the neurodegenerative process. The need to identify, in the early stages of the disease, the population at risk of cognitive decline has led to the formulation of the concept of Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI). This neurobehavioral syndrome is characterized by late-onset sustained psychiatric symptoms, in patients without cognitive deficits or in those with MCI, identifying a condition associated with an increased probability of conversion into dementia. MBI represents the neurobehavioral axis of pre-dementia risk states, as a complement to the neurocognitive axis of MCI. For some, MBI may be the initial manifestation of neurodegenerative disease, observed before cognitive impairment is apparent. The Mild Behavioral Impairment-Checklist (MBI-C) was developed on the basis of the MBI diagnostic criteria, established by the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). The MBI-C allows to identify, in a standardized way, patients with MBI and to follow the course of their neurodegenerative disease. This article describes the creation of the MBI-C scale and presents its Italian version.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is brain dysfunction caused by both acute and chronic liver diseases that produces a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of other known brain diseases. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the mildest form of this spectrum. MHE is defined as HE without symptoms on clinical or neurological examination, but with deficits in the performance of psychometric tests, working memory, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is associated with impaired driving skills and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and has been associated with increased hospitalizations and death. Despite its clinical importance, a large number of clinicians had never investigated whether their cirrhotic patients might have MHE. Although, there is no single gold standard test for diagnosis of MHE, a combination of two neuropsychological tests or psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score battery test and/or neurophysiological test is standard for diagnosis of MHE. It was found that, treatment for MHE improves neuropsychiatric performance and quality of life and decreases the risk of developing overt HE (OHE). The agents used to treat OHE have been tested in patients with MHE. In particular, lactulose, rifaximin, probiotics and l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) have all been shown to be beneficial, with documented improvement in psychometric performance after treatment.",

      "title": "Clinical management of viral encephalitis",
      "abstract": "Most cases of viral encephalitis are acute, although a few viruses can cause chronic progressive encephalitis. Rarely, systemic virus infection may trigger post-infectious encephalomyelitis. Viral encephalitis typically reflects viral invasion of the brain parenchyma. Encephalitis patients usually have alterations in their state of consciousness. Some viruses produce “diffuse” encephalitis in which the predominant features are impaired consciousness, signs of generalized central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction such as generalized seizures, and a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Conversely, other viruses produce “focal encephalitis,” in which altered consciousness and CSF abnormalities are accompanied by prominent focal abnormalities on neuroimaging tests or clinical examination including hemiparesis, aphasia, hemisensory loss, ataxia, focal as well as generalized seizures, and, less often, involuntary movements, visual field defects, and cranial nerve deficits. Personality changes, language, and memory disturbances and psychotic features are frequent. Viral encephalitis must be distinguished from nonviral conditions that can present a similar clinical picture, including Lyme disease, tuberculosis, syphilis, Listeria, Mycoplasma, fungal and parasitic infections, brain abscess, subdural hematoma or abscess, brain tumors, CNS vasculitis, and toxic/metabolic encephalopathies.",

It is remarkable that an immune-mediated encephalitis triggered by a confirmed subacute bacterial meningitis is documented, and this is the case we will present. A 22-year-old woman with no previous medical history, immunocompetent, with three months of behavioral, affective and cognitive symptoms with subsequent compromise of sensory perception and psychosis. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid showed inflammatory signs with positive FilmArray© for Streptococcus pneumoniae. She received anti-psychotic and antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks without clinical improvement. Postencephalitic syndrome with immune-mediated psychosis was considered as a diagnosis, and immunosuppressive management with corticosteroid and plasmapheresis was initiated with complete resolution of symptoms. After one year of follow-up no neurological relapse has been identified. Encephalitis is a neurological syndrome due to brain parenchymal damage that can result in psychiatric symptoms including psychosis and behavioral changes. Its causes are usually infectious (usually viral) or autoimmune (Anti NMDA, AMPA, LGI1 or others). A psychiatric condition in bacterial meningitis without improvement with antibiotic treatment is remarkable, its presence should suggest an immune-mediated post-infectious syndrome that may respond to the use of immunomodulators even in the absence of identification of autoimmune encephalitis-associated antibodies. No similar cases have been reported in the literature. Immune-mediated psychosis may be a manifestation of post-encephalitic syndrome associated with bacterial meningitis and its treatment with immunosuppressants may offer benefit in cases where the use of antipsychotics and antibiotics shows no improvement.",

Peripheral neuropathy typically causes a great deal of discomfort, and progressively worsens until the pain is severe. Treatments for peripheral neuropathy include plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressive therapy. IVIg is an expensive and less widely available therapy for neuropathy. HIV patients respond well to the same treatments that work in other patients with these problems, and drug-related neuropathy is often easily resolved by changing medications.

      "abstract": "The review deals with neonatal seizures, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. neonatal seizures are the most prominent signals of the largest number of neonatal neurological disorders. The convulsive phenomena may be subtle. The predominant etiological process is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Prognosis is related primarily to the neurological disease responsible for the seizures. Treatment may be specific for the underlying disorder (e.g., glucose or calcium) or less specific (i.e., therapy with anticonvulsant drugs). Prompt control of the seizures is important to avoid brain injury secondary to the effects of the seizures on ventilation, perfusion, and brain metabolism. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the newborn most often is a consequence of intrauterine asphyxia. Diagnosis depends primarily on recognition of the clinical syndrome but also on a variety of neurodiagnostic techniques, including radionuclide and CT brain scans. Prognosis is estimated best by a combination of clinical analysis and specialized neurodiagnostic studies. management is based principally on vigorous support, particularly of ventilation and perfusion, maintenance of adequate glucose influx, and control of seizures. Intraventricular hemorrhage is the most common type of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage. The neuropathology is characterized by bleeding from capillaries of the subependymal germinal matrix. Secondary rupture of the ependymal lining then causes intraventricular hemorrhage. Pathogenesis relates to the anatomy of the germinal matrix, the distribution and regulation of cerebral blood flow, and the structure and vulnerability of periventricular capillaries. Precise diagnosis requires a brain imaging procedure; portable, real-time ultrasound is the preferred approach for critically ill infants. Prognosis relates to the severity of the hemorrhage as well as any preceding hypoxic-ischemic insults and the subsequent occurrence of hydrocephalus. Choice of therapy for posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation depends upon severity and rapidity of progression and ranges from close observation only to ventriculoperitoneal shunting.",

The majority of the symptoms are short-term memory impairment accompanied by concentration and motoric deceleration. Opportunistic infections of Toxoplasma gondii often accompanies and aggravates the cognitive impairment that occurs.Case: Male, 55-year-old, complained by the family to be forgetful and hard to concentrate since last two weeks and got worse over time. The daily activities of the patient were often disturbed. The awareness, cranial nerve, motor function, sensory, and autonomic were within normal limits. Laboratory tests showed reactive IgG anti-toxoplasma (4520.00 IU / mL) and CD4 128 cells/ÂµL. A non-contrast head CT-Scan showed multiple ill-bordered hypodense lesions with broad peripheral edema in left cerebral hemispheres. Test of cognitive function with MoCA-Ina scored 13 and MMSE scored 19.Discussion: Dementia in HIV manifests as a collection of symptoms of cognitive and motor impairment that interfere with daily activities. The pathogenesis is thought to be caused by interactions with viral proteins and secondary inflammation. Chronic toxoplasmosis is associated with the incidence of dementia in HIV, which usually occurs when CD4 &lt;200 cells/ÂµL. The underlying pathology of inflammation responsible for neurotransmitter modulation and oxidative stress. HAART administration related to a risk reduction of dementia in HIV. High penetrating antiretroviral lowers viral load better, so it can reliably reduce inflammation while slowing the progression of cognitive impairment.Conclusion: HIV infection often leads to dementia, either with or without opportunistic infections. Currently, HAART is the only therapy, accompanied by education and follow-up of the patient's cognitive function.",

These disorders ectopically damage the nervous system due to the abnormal chemotaxis of neutrophils. The neutrophils' chemotaxis is induced by oral muco-cutaneous bacterial infections and the dysregulation of cytokines, including interleukins. The frequencies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 in neuro-Behçet disease and HLA-B54 as well as Cw1 in neuro-Sweet disease significantly higher than the levels present in Japanese normal controls. Notably, their frequencies are also higher in patients exhibiting neurological complications than in patients without neurological complications. These HLA types are considered risk factors that are directly related to the etiology of these diseases. Prednisolone and colchicine, which suppress neutrophil activation, are used to treat the acute phase of both diseases. Alternatively, dapsone is prescribed to prednisolone-dependent recurrent cases of neuro-Sweet disease. Dementia is a neurological symptom of these disorders, especially in the chronic progressive subtype of neuro-Behçet disease. Other immunosuppressant drugs, including methotrexate and infliximab, are administered to patients with the chronic progressive type of neuro-Behçet disease.

Symptoms must persist for three months or more to define this disorder. The clinical manifestations are variable and nonspecific, but have a great impact on the quality of life of patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are commonly reported in CP, mostly chronic fatigue, cognitive disorders, attention disorders, among others. The pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully known, but the most described are hypoxia related neuronal damage, microvascular lesions, a persistent proinflammatory state, activation of latent viral infections, and alteration of the blood-brain barrier. There are no specific complementary tests to confirm the diagnosis of CP. There is also no specific treatment to date and most therapies are aimed at relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. This article provides a comprehensive bibliographic review of the most common neuropsychiatric manifestations of CP, including its probable pathophysiological mechanisms and the therapies proposed to date.",

У ряда пациентов с заболеваниями нервной системы инфицирование вирусом гриппа и развитие инфекционного процесса сопровождаются повышенным риском утяжеления течения заболевания, ухудшения прогноза, появления потребности в госпитализации, неблагоприятного исхода инфекции. Обсуждается целесообразность и приоритетность вакцинопрофилактики гриппа у лиц с конкретными нозологиями, относящимися к компетенции невролога. Вакцинопрофилактика во многих случаях признается эффективной мерой предупреждения тяжелого течения гриппа у неврологических больных и развития осложнений. Клиницисту необходимы углубленные знания показаний и ограничений вакцинопрофилактики гриппа у пациентов с патологией нервной системы. The article discusses issues related to the peculiarities of the course of influenza against the background of neurological diseases: influenza in epilepsy and other conditions characterized by increased convulsive readiness, influenza in some pathologies of the peripheral nervous system, influenza in neuromuscular diseases and multiple sclerosis, influenza and cerebral vascular pathology. In a number of patients with diseases of the nervous system, contact with influenza virus and infectious process are accompanied by an increased risk of the disease exacerbation, worsening the prognosis, need for hospitalization, and poor outcomes. The expediency and priority of influenza vaccine prophylaxis in persons with specific nosologies that are within the competence of a neurologist are discussed. In many cases, in neurological patients, vaccination is recognized as an effective measure to prevent the severe course of influenza and complicationы emergence. Doctors need in-depth knowledge of the indications and limitations of influenza vaccination in patients with nervous system disorders.",

      "abstract": "The term peripheral neuropathy refers to disorders of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) including single and multiple (asymmetric) mononeuropathies, and symmetrical involvement of many nerves (polyneuropathy). Further classification depends on a mixture of phenomenological, neurophysiological, pathological and aetiological parameters. The temporal evolution of symptoms divides polyneuropathy (PN) into acute or chronic. Acute PN e.g. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is rare but an important entity to recognise because whilst at times severe, it is treatable. Most PN are chronic and usually develop over several months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell or taste. Neurological complications have been reported in the context of COVID-19 infection both in the acute and subacute phase, as part of the post-COVID syndrome or as a result of the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. In the acute phase, it has been reported that GBS prevalence is 15 cases per 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Demyelinating GBSs variant in particular is the most prevalent. Although not necessarily directly caused by SARS-CoV-2, prolonged stay in ICUs is associated with increased risk of ICU related neuro-myopathy. In the chronic phase, preliminary results of ongoing prospective observational studies suggest that patients suffered from COVID-19 have increased risk of developing mild axonal peripheral neuropathy that shows evidence of length dependency. Interestingly, it has been reported that – even in the absence of electrophysiologically confirmed PN – 1 in 5 patients reported deterioration of pre-existing neuropathic symptoms or development of new neuropathic symptoms, particularly pain, after COVID-19. Such symptoms tend to persist for months. Further studies are needed to describe the natural history of the PNS involvement during and after COVID-19 infection.",

Persistent cognitive and functional complaints could be a result of general somatic symptoms, emotional distress, or residual central nervous system damage or dysfunction. Most studies of cognition in postacute West Nile virus infection rely on self-report. This descriptive study aimed to document cognitive deficits in a sample of the 2003 infected population reported in New Mexico. Patients with clinically defined neuroinvasive disease or who were impaired on brief mental status screening were seen for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We found that one year after symptom onset, more than half of the sample had objectively measurable neuropsychological impairment in at least two cognitive domains. Impairment was not related to subjective complaints of physical or emotional distress, or premorbid intellectual abilities. Persistent cognitive impairment in West Nile virus infection may be due to prolonged or permanent damage to the central nervous system.",

After admission to the medical service (and ICU), she responded to a lorazepam challenge, and made a complete recovery within several weeks after combination treatment with IV methylprednisolone, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), and rituximab.ConclusionAutoimmune encephalitis should be suspected in patients presenting with labile vital signs, family history of autoimmunity, and new psychosis without prior history of psychiatric problems. Other important diagnostic considerations include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, substance-induced psychosis, or catatonia secondary to post-infectious immune-mediated encephalitis. While a first psychotic break should always be considered, the presence of autonomic instability, catatonia, seizures, or dyskinesias in a young woman postpartum should prompt a thorough medical and neurological work-up.",

      "abstract": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a neurocognitive dysfunction that is present in the majority of patients with cirrhosis. MHE has a characteristic cognitive profile that cannot be diagnosed clinically. This cognitive dysfunction is independent of sleep dysfunction or problems with overall intelligence. MHE has a significant impact on quality of life, the ability to function in daily life and progression to overt hepatic encephalopathy. Driving ability can be impaired in MHE and this may be a significant factor behind motor vehicle accidents. A crucial aspect of the clinical care of MHE patients is their driving history, which is often ignored during routine care and can add a vital dimension to the overall disease assessment. Driving history should be an integral part of the care of patients with MHE. The preserved communication skills and lack of specific signs and insight make MHE difficult to diagnose. The predominant strategies for MHE diagnosis are psychometric or neurophysiological testing. These are usually limited by financial, normative or time constraints. Studies into inhibitory control, cognitive drug research and critical flicker frequency tests are encouraging. These tests do not require a psychologist for administration and interpretation. Lactulose and probiotics have been studied for their potential use as therapies for MHE, but these are not standard-of-care practices at this time. Therapy can improve the quality of life in MHE patients but the natural history, specific diagnostic strategies and treatment options are still being investigated.",

Es una entidad rara, benigna y autolimitada de causa desconocida y que se diagnostica por exclusion.\r\nSuele aparecer entre la tercera y la cuarta decadas de la vida, pero el rango de edad de los casos reportados va desde los 5 hasta los 52 anos. Solo una minoria de pacientes tiene antecedentes personales o familiares de migrana y se ha reportado un prodromo viral en el 25-40% de los casos. Los deficits neurologicos mas comunes son hemiparesia, hemiparestesia y disfasia (la afectacion del hemisferio izquierdo ha sido reportada mas frecuentemente), siendo los sintomas visuales mas raros. Aunque el deficit suele ser focal, tambien se han reportado manifestaciones difusas como un estado confusional agudo. Usualmente el deficit precede al dolor de cabeza, pero la cefalea puede ser el primer signo de un episodio. Aunque HaNDL es considerado un desorden monofasico, el 75% de los pacientes presentan ataques repetidos que ocurren por semanas e incluso meses despues del episodio inicial y los deficits neurologicos frecuentemente varian entre episodios, involucrando diferentes regiones cerebrales. Los sintomas y signos mejoran paralelamente a la disminucion de pleocitosis en el LCR. En el electroencefalograma realizado durante el periodo sintomatico se ve un enlentecimiento excesivo unilateral, siendo el bilateral menos frecuente; dicha alteracion desaparece tras el episodio sintomatico y no se han reportado alteraciones epileptiformes.\r\nUna vez establecido el diagnostico, el tratamiento es sintomatico y de soporte, junto con educacion sobre el cuadro.

Once HIE occurs, molecular cascades are triggered favoring the oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation damage that promote cell death via apoptosis or necrosis. Currently, the therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of care in HIE; however, it has a small window of action and only can be used in children of more than 36 gestational weeks; for this reason, it is very important to develop new therapies to prevent the progression of the hypoxic-ischemic injury or to develop neuroregenerative therapies in severe HIE cases. The objective of this revision is to describe the emerging treatments for HIE, either preventing cell death for oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, or exacerbated inflammation, as well as describing a new therapeutic approach for neuroregeneration, such as mesenchymal stem cells, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and gonadotropin realizing hormone agonists.",

The prevalence of delirium in elderly patients admitting to hospital is 5-55% [1]. Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome that may occur in several different settings and one of them is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes many cerebral cortex abnormalities such as confusion, mood and memory changes, delirium with or without hallucinations, depression and acute psychotic states [2,3]. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) describes the spectrum of potentially reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities seen in patients with liver dysfunction after exclusion of unrelated neurologic and/or metabolic abnormalities. The clinical manifestations of HE is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits of varying severity without specific lesions in the central nervous system. The symptoms range from minimal changes in personality to coma, including delirium [4]. Usually, in the elderly patients with cirrhosis, it is hard to differentiate two clinical situations. Here we report a case of an elderly patient with cirrhosis who experienced delirium due to vitamin B12 deficiency, but was treated as HE before.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Aspects of Brain Injury in Childhood: A Review",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

      "abstract": "Patients with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may develop a dementia in the course of the disease. Once a provisional diagnosis of dementia has been made, the clinician needs to clarify the type of dementia from which the person is suffering. Dementia was classified traditionally as pre-senile or senile, based on age of onset. The age of onset may be helpful in deciding on the aetiology, but many of the causes of dementia are found in both age groups, making this traditional approach to classification relatively redundant. A dementia may develop in the course of established Parkinson's disease. Alcohol is known to be neurotoxic, but the existence of 'alcoholic dementia' as a distinct entity is doubtful. Many patients diagnosed with alcoholic dementia actually have Korsakoff's syndrome. Subcortical dementias include those associated with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and HIV. Dementia may dominate the clinical picture but there may be concomitant physical problems, e.g. dysarthria and gait disorders.",

      "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) causes severe neuroinvasive disease in humans characterized by meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis variant). In neuroinvasive disease, WNV infection of neurons resulting in neuronal loss is generally presumed to be the anatomical substrate for the high morbidity and mortality. However, on a molecular level, WNV infection also results in a significant upregulation of important proinflammatory molecules that have been reported to promote neuroinflammation and cytotoxicity. Currently, there is no specific treatment for the neurological complications of WNV infection. We present a 71-year-old woman who developed WNV infection that rapidly progressed to severe generalized weakness and encephalitis manifesting with bulbar signs (dysphagia, dysarthria) and persistent delirium and stupor. Consciousness remained impaired for 9 days and then she received a 5-day course of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily). After the first day, voluntary movement and spontaneous eye-opening increased and by the end of the second day, she was awake and responding to commands. Thereafter, she remained awake and responsive. Although the rapid improvement from stupor to wakefulness following treatment with an anti-inflammatory immunosuppressant could merely be coincidence, since these observations are of one patient, it may also provide a clue that in some cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease a post-infectious pro-inflammatory state, rather than neuronal loss, may also contribute to morbidity. Further clinical trials are warranted to determine if high dose corticosteroids and other drugs that can alter this neuro-inflammatory cascade may be potentially beneficial in the treatment of WNV neuroinvasive disease.",

      "title": "Possible Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms Which May Lead to Long-Term Neurological Disorders in COVID-19 Patients",
      "abstract": "This review aims to provide insight into the possible long-term neurological complications that COVID-19 patients may experience after the resolution of intense acute inflammation characterized as “cytokine storm.” Neurological symptoms such as fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, dyspnea, anorexia, malaise, myalgia, ataxia, seizure, hypogeusia, and hyposmia are commonly seen in these patients. COVID-19 related encephalitis is also seen sporadically. However, some researchers believe neuroinflammation is more common than what is reported. Neurological abnormalities that are linked to neuroinflammation are of particular concern because neuroinflammation is hypothesized to cause neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and Schizophrenia. Many potential routes can lead to inflammation in the nervous system and elicit neuron cell death in COVID-19 patients. These include the potential neurotropic pathway of the novel coronavirus, CNS parenchymal infectability, thrombotic ischemic stroke, cytokine storm, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Past pandemics of similar neurotropic viruses could also offer insights regarding the long-term neurological effects of COVID-19. In support of our hypothesis, the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 saw an increased incidence of neurodegenerative disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. We do not know exactly what the future will hold for COVID-19 however, it is of paramount importance to attempt to anticipate and prepare for the possible chronic neurological sequelae and mitigate or prevent their effects.",

      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

Furthermore, patients on ICI may initially present to oncology or neurology. We report a case series of 3 patients treated with ICIs presenting with diplopia or ptosis, found to have concurrent myocarditis in addition to immune-related myopathy (irMyopathy) or myasthenia gravis (irMG). None of the patients described cardiac symptoms, underscoring the importance of screening for myocarditis in patients presenting with diplopia and/or other neuromuscular symptoms which may suggest either irMyopathy or irMG.",

While the primary injury may be due to meningeal and/or parenchymal invasion by the pathogen and release of toxins, a variety of secondary insults occur, which may influence the outcome as much as the primary insult. This concept is well recognized in brain trauma(1,2) where early recognition of secondary injuries and their appropriate treatment has been shown to improve outcome. Hypoxia, ischemia and metabolic disturbances are important secondary insults recognized in brain trauma, These are known to cause permanent neurological damage and worsening of outcome if undetected and untreated. In CNS infections, with their complex pathophysiologies, there is ample scope for such secondary insults. Monitoring in patients with CNS infections is to detect these secondary insults, allowing for a more informed approach to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

Diabetes mellitus as well as sytemic metabolic and toxic disorders which commonly produce neurological complications were excluded. Segmental demyelination with disorganization of myelin lamellae were striking morphological features found on sural nerve biopsy. Fluctuations in memory performance correlated inversely with plasma lipid levels and appear to be a characteristic feature of hyperlipidemic dementia.

The cause of narcolepsy is still unknown, although it has been associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors; the prevalence is approximately 0.04%2. The peak age of onset is the second decade of life, and onset after age 55 or prior to age 10 is rare. Not every symptom is present in all patients, and the severity is also variable2.\r\n\r\nHypocretin, a neuropeptide of hypothalamic origin, has been involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. The CSF hypocretin-1 levels are very low or even undetectable in most narcoleptic patients with cataplexy. The HLA-DQB1*0602 allele, which is involved in the control of the hypocretin receptor, is also present in 88% to 98% of such patients2.\r\n\r\nThe association between narcolepsy and vaccination against the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was initially suggested in 2010 in Finland and Sweden, leading to the suspension of vaccination in these countries3.

      "abstract": "La demencia asociada a infección por virus de inmunodeficiencia humana (DVIH) es una entidad caracterizada por la tríada de compromiso cognitivo, síntomas conductuales y motores, que generan serias dificultades en la capacidad funcional del paciente. Las múltiples denominaciones generan confusión y alta probabilidad de subreconocimiento. No obstante, la incidencia de DVIH es controversial; se tiene claro que más de 90% de pacientes con sida tiene anormalidades neuropatólogicas compatibles con DVIH. Los mecanismos patogénicos involucran una compleja interacción entre el VIH y las células del cerebro, que generan claramente dos vías incluyentes, la inflamatoria y la no inflamatoria, las cuales generan factores neurotóxicos y quimiotácticos, inductores de apoptosis, que conducen a una disrupción neuronal-glial, probablemente responsable de la injuria y/o muerte neuronal, que conduciría a un fenómeno de neurodegeneración acelerada. Los síntomas son de una demencia subcortical, siendo los síntomas de presentación más comunes el compromiso de la memoria, enlentecimiento mental, dificultad para la marcha y depresión. El diagnóstico es esencialmente clínico y se realiza por exclusión. Son de utilidad práctica la HIV Dementia Scale (HDS) y la International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), como pruebas iniciales de descarte. El tratamiento debe incluir la combinación de antiretrovirales y neuroprotectores. Como conclusión, la DVIH es una complicación devastadora de la infección por VIH que debe ser reconocida tempranamente.",

The most common neurological complication of AIDS is a subacute encephalitis caused by infection of the brain with HIV. At least 60% of patients with AIDS will eventually develop symptoms of this chronic dementing neurological disorder characterized by progressive cognitive, motor and behavioural abnormalities (Navia, et al., 1986b). This disorder may also be the presenting sign or sole clinical manifestation of HIV infection (Navia and Price, 1987). HIV enters the central nervous system (CNS) in the early stages of HIV infection and may cause an acute aseptic meningitis at the time of seroconversion (Ho et al., 1985a; McArthur et al., 1988). Other neurological disorders which are frequently associated with HIV infections include peripheral neuropathies (Cornblath et al., 1987; de la Monte et al., 1988) and myelopathies (Petito et al., 1985; Rance et al., 1988), but whether these disorders are directly caused by HIV is unknown.",

Many of these complications are linked directly or indirectly to immunosuppressive therapy. However, neurological disorders may also result from graft versus host disease, or be an expression of the underlying disease which prompted transplantation, as well as injury induced during radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and ICU stay. In rare cases, neuroinfectious pathogens may be transmitted with the transplanted tissue or organ. Diagnosis may be a challenge because clinical symptoms and findings on neuroimaging lack specificity, and a biological specimen or tissue diagnosis is often needed for definitive diagnosis. Management is centered on preventing further neurological injury, etiology-targeted therapy, and balancing the benefits and toxicities of specific immunosuppressive agents.",

Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

Seit Einführung der hochaktiven antiretroviralen Therapie Mitte der 90er Jahre hat sich die Inzidenz der Erkrankten praktisch halbiert, dennoch ist der ADK weiterhin mit einer Inzidenz von ca. 20% unter allen HIV-infizierten Patienten vertreten. Zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Infektion ist eine Erstmanifestation möglich, typischerweise treten die Symptome jedoch erst in späten Stadien auf. Der Beginn ist schleichend, selten abrupt, und manifestiert sich meist in Form von Verhaltensauffälligkeiten, Aufmerksamkeits- Merkfähigkeits- und Gedächtnisstörungen, sowie in der Mehrzahl der Fälle gekoppelt an Defizite der Feinmotorik. Diagnostisch sind die magnetresonanztomographische Bildgebung, die Liquordiagnostik, elektrophysiologische Untersuchungen der Feinmotorik, sowie gezielt kombinierte neuropsychologische Testverfahren wegweisend. Betroffene Patienten sollten mit einer Kombination aus liquorgängigen antiretroviralen Medikamente behandelt werden und in engen Zeitabständen motorisch sowie neuropsycholgisch nachuntersucht werden.",

It is sometimes mistaken for a psychiatric disorder and other times not considered in the differential diagnosis of an encephalitic process. Correct identification of this disease and prompt treatment are key for optimal recovery, which might take weeks to months. Many patients manifest severe symptoms, with depressed level of consciousness, breathing dysfunction and dysautonomia requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We report the case a young male patient with anti-NMDA encephalitis who presented typical neuropsychiatric symptoms. Despite being diagnosed and treated in a timely manner, he did not respond well to first-line immunotherapy and was admitted to the ICU with neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular dysfunction. This resulted in prolonged hospital admission and many infectious complications. Despite the severity of the disease, the patient managed to recover in the months following discharge from hospital.Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a clinical entity described relatively recently, typically manifesting as a neuropsychiatric disorder and which should be in the differential diagnosis of any case of encephalitis, especially in young patients.Important prognostic factors for anti-NMDA encephalitis are lack of clinical improvement within the first four weeks of treatment and need for admission to the ICU.Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a severe disease with good response to immunotherapy, hence the importance of a correct diagnosis. Nonetheless, recovery from severe disease may take months to years.",

      "abstract": "Impaired insight into illness is commonly observed across various psychiatric illnesses, but is most frequent in patients with schizophrenia. The clinical relevance and public health impact of poor insight is reflected by its close association with important clinical outcome measures, such as treatment non-adherence, lower psychosocial functioning, poor prognosis, involuntary hospitalization, and higher utilization of emergency services. Although the neurobiology of insight has not been determined, data from neurocognitive and a few structural imaging studies provide some understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of insight function in schizophrenia. Using published and preliminary data, we propose a hypothetical model of insight that may help initiate neurobiological investigations in this complex area.",

No medications have been shown to have a consistent therapeutic benefit. Delirium is a form of brain dysfunction characterized by the acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. These features are also seen in states of acute sleep deprivation. It is believed that the state of delirium contributes to disrupted sleep just as sleep deprivation is considered a modifiable risk factor for delirium. Improving sleep conditions and other nonpharmacologic interventions to promote sleep may be an underused approach to preventing and treating delirium in critical illness.",

The name refers to the appearance of net-like collateral blood vessels that develop in response. Its incidence is significantly higher in East Asian countries and primarily affects children in the first decade of life, although it can also occur in older individuals. The disease may cause ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes that are considered the two main types of moyamoya disease presentation, varying in prevalence in the population of children and adults. Other symptoms include headache, epilepsy, and transient ischaemic attack. Treatment remains mainly surgical, as no medication has yet been found to cure or slow down the progression of the disease. The pathogenesis remains unclear, although it is most likely multifactorial, including modifiable risk factors such as obesity, but also unmodifiable risk factors, like genetic predisposition. At the same time, moyamoya syndrome, also known as quasi-moyamoya disease, is a moyamoya-like vasculopathy associated with various systemic diseases or conditions, such as atherosclerosis or brain tumours. However, many studies do not distinguish moyamoya disease from moyamoya syndrome. Still, both conditions present with the same symptoms, and the management approach is generally the same.",

NB includes acute type and chronic progressive type. Acute NB is characterized by acute meningoencephalitis with focal lesions, which respond to steroid therapy. By contrast, chronic progressive NB is characterized by intractable slowly progressive dementia and/or psychosis with persistent elevation of cerebrospinal fluid IL-6 activity, which is resistant to conventional steroid therapy.

BM and encephalitides are lifethreatening neurological emergencies, and early recognition, efficient decision-making, and rapid commencement of therapy can be lifesaving. Empirical therapy should be initiated promptly whenever BM or encephalitides are a probable diagnosis. In this article cognitive impairments, including dementia, presenting in patients with BM, Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE), Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) encephalitis, and Anti N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis are reviewed. In the above mentioned diseases, cognitive impairment without fever might be observed at the time of disease onset. cognitive impairment has been also noted in some aged or immunocompromised patients at the onset of BM. Immediate memory disturbance as one of the first symptoms of HHV-6 encephalitis presented in 74% of patients with this disease. Cognitive impairment, including dementia as sequela, was also found in 10-27% of patients with BM, 54-69% of patients with HSVE, 33% of HHV-6 encephalitis patients, and 39% of patients with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. Suitable therapeutic management of these diseases at the acute stage is thus required in order to avoid these sequelae.",

COVID-19 is associated with a long-COVID syndrome that presents with cognitive decline and fatigue. Recent studies show the emergence of a novel syndrome known as post-acute COVID syndrome or long COVID, which constitutes a variety of symptoms that continue for four weeks following the onset of a COVID-19 diagnosis. Numerous post-COVID patients experience both short and long-lasting symptoms affecting several organs, including the brain, which includes being unconscious, bradyphrenia, or amnesia. This long COVID status comprises of \"brain fog\", which, coupled with neuro-cognitive effects, has a significant role in prolonging the recovery phase. The pathogenesis of brain fog is currently unknown. One of the leading causes might be the involvement of neuroinflammation due to mast cells stimulated by pathogenic and stress stimuli. This in turn, triggers the release of mediators that activate microglia, causing inflammation in the hypothalamus. Its ability to invade the nervous system through trans-neural or hematogenous mechanisms is possibly the chief cause behind the presenting symptoms. This case report highlights a unique case of brain fog in a COVID-19 patient suggesting COVID-19's neurotropic nature and how it may lead to neurologic complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.",

Cross-condition comparison of the nature and frequency of cognitive impairment is difficult as these conditions often coexist, and there exists no consensus as to the definition of cognitive impairment, nor the optimal number and type of neuropsychological tests required for evaluation. There is as yet no clear evidence for condition-specific profiles of cognitive impairment. Rather, a generalized profile consisting of subclinical levels of impairment in attention, processing speed, executive, and memory functions from bilateral frontal-subcortical ischemia fits across all conditions. This profile: occurs only in subgroups of patients; is inconsistently related to measures of illness severity; is unrelated to patient self-report or level of functional independence; is exacerbated by very high levels of emotional distress; and is reversible in some cases but can also progress to frank neurological disease (dementia) in others, especially the elderly, when multiple conditions coexist, and/or when medical condition severity progresses.",

      "abstract": "Background: Leigh disease[1], also termed as Sub Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy (SNP) is a rare, inheritable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic pathological features usually presenting in infancy or early childhood. It was first reported in 1951 by Denis Leigh[2], a British neuro pathologist, in a 7 month old infant that progressed rapidly and resulted in death over a 6 week period. Clinically, Leigh disease is characterized by psychomotor delay or regression, muscular hypotonia, brainstem signs (especially strabismus, nystagmus and swallowing difficulties) & ataxia. In late stages pyramidal signs & respiratory insufficiency occurs. In most cases, dysfunction of the respiratory chain enzymes is responsible for the disease. There are several known genetically determined causes of Leigh disease: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, complex I or II deficiency, complex IV (COX) deficiency, complex V (ATPase) deficiency, and deficiency of coenzyme Q10[1]. These defects may occur sporadically or be inherited by autosomal recessive transmission, as in the case of COX deficiency; by X-linked transmission, as in the case of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α deficiency; or by maternal transmission, as in complex V (ATPase 6 nt 8993 mutation) deficiency. About 30% of cases are due to mutations in mtDNA[1]. Despite its considerable clinical, genetic and biochemistry heterogeneity, the basic neuro pathological features in children affected are almost identical; which are focal, bilateral, and symmetric necrotic lesions associated with demyelination, vascular proliferation and gliosis in the brainstem, diencephalon, basal ganglia, and cerebellum[1]. It is possible to come to a diagnosis of SNE on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, mode of inheritance, metabolic abnormalities, and neuro imaging findings[4]. We report a rare case which presented clinically as a neurodegenerative disorder and diagnosed as Leigh disease on MRI.",

The patient had no past or family history of mood disorders, but had risk factors for HIV infection. He had a rapid downhill course from initial manic symptoms to depression, dementia and then death within 10 months. Such rapid cognitive deterioration into AIDS dementia after mania is consistent with previous reports.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

In this article, the authors examine how behavior is affected by damage to different parts of the brain. They then focus on damage caused by specific infections of the brain and how these can result in abnormal behavior with legal consequences. Examples of such infections include neurosyphilis, encephalitis lethargica, herpes simplex encephalitis, and various other viral encephalitides, both acute and chronic. The AIDS dementia complex, which results from HIV infection of the brain, causes behavioral abnormalities in addition to motor and cognitive impairments. In some cases of violence and other criminal behavior, this can be a consequence of central nervous system infection, and the authors suggest that criminal sanctions in such events are inappropriate in the absence of volitional criminal intent.",

Two patients developed secondary microcephaly and all four patients showed cortical atrophy on computed tomographic scanning. Three of the patients died. Postmortem neuropathological findings included gross cortical atorphy, microglial nodules, and intranuclear inclusions, as are described in the subacute encephalitis reported in adult AIDS patients.

Within little more than a decade, the subject which was thought to be associated with relatively few conditions, such as mongolism, cretinism, microcephaly and the like, has been shown by medical, genetical and psychiatric research to be significantly related to about 70 conditions. It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type.

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients with a primary neurological injury or illness pose unique challenges for pain, agitation, and delirium management in intensive care units (ICUs). Detection and monitoring can be limited by contextual level of consciousness (LOC) alterations, cognition, expression, or language deficits. Recent data suggest that existing pain assessment tools may not be applicable to all neurocritically ill patients, especially in those with LOC alterations and atypical pain-associated behaviors. Targeted sedation goals may be neurologically disease specific; for instance, intracranial pressure (ICP) targets will supersede sedation titration by other criteria. Technology such as bispectral index (BIS) may be beneficial in avoiding excessive medication administration in deeply sedated neurologically injured ICU patients. Given the wide variety of pathology in the neurocritically ill patients, it is unclear if delirium can be diagnosed and unequivocally differentiated from symptoms of the underlying neurological pathology. However, delirium symptoms may herald life-threatening primary insult progression or result from a new secondary neurological injury and should be monitored. Patients with neurological injury or illness are often excluded from ICU studies addressing pain, sedation, and delirium, but this need not be the case. We review what is understood in this area based on current evidence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hereditary optic neuropathies are a group of disorders characterized by optic nerve damage in which the underlying cause is heritable. Optic atrophy is a clinical state in which there is pallor of the optic nerve due to loss of ganglion cell axons and supporting microvascular tissue, often associated with decreased vision. Optic neuropathy is a more general term that includes the early phase of the disease when optic atrophy may not yet be present. Clinical severity may vary from lack of symptoms to complete blindness. Hereditary causes of optic neuropathy include primary optic nerve disease; compression by a genetically determined tumor, for example, in neurofibromatosis; or degeneration, as occurs in the later stages of retinitis pigmentosa. Although glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and has features like other hereditary optic neuropathies, it is not discussed in this chapter. Optic atrophy may be an isolated event or may be associated with other neurologic or systemic manifestations. In this chapter we discuss Kjer autosomal dominant optic atrophy and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) as well as optic atrophy associated with Wolfram syndrome and some of the neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in many of the hereditary optic neuropathies.",

      "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is defined as a focal spinal cord lesion that involves three or more segments of the spinal cord as shown by neuroimaging, and results in a profound disability. The clinical picture of a patient with idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is often dramatic and may consist of paraparesis or tetraparesis, sensory disturbances, and pelvic dysfunction. Idiopathic longitudinally advanced transverse myelitis is a common manifestation of the neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, but can also occur in various other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, or Sjogrens syndrome, or in infectious diseases involving the CNS. It is less likely to occur in isolation, as the only manifestation of a demyelinating disease of the nervous system of an unknown etiology (idiopathic myelitis).&#x0D; Clinical case description: The clinical observation presented in the article demonstrates the difficulties of establishing a nosological diagnosis in the case of a monophasic course of TM in the absence of other autoimmune and infectious diseases of the central nervous system. The patient with idiopathic longitudinally distributed TM had no visual disturbances and no antibodies to aquaporin 4 and to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) with twice repeated tests.&#x0D; Conclusion: In this regard, it is important to dynamically monitor the clinical manifestations and MRI signs in patients with an isolated lesion of a demyelinating nature in the form of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis.",

      "abstract": "Encephalitis is a brain parenchyma inflammation leading to the impairment of brain function. In majority of cases, inflammation concurrently spreads to brain membranes, leading to meningoencephalitis. The encephalitis can be due to its etiology categorized into infectious (primary), post-infectious (which includes post-vaccinal), and autoimmune. Viral infections, primarily herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, non-polio enteroviruses, and arboviruses (arthropod borne) are the most common causes of infectious encephalitis. Although more than 100 infectious agents can cause acute encephalitis, in only 60% of cases the underlying etiology is identified. Etiology of autoimmune encephalopathies can be divided into paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic. Symptoms and signs of autoimmune encephalitis commonly include headache, behavioral changes, memory and sleep disturbances, seizures, and impaired consciousness. In adults, the autoimmune encephalopathies are most commonly paraneoplastic in nature and respond poorly to the immunosuppressive therapy. In children and adolescents, autoimmune encephalopathies are more commonly caused by autoantibodies targeting surface or synapse antigens (NMDAR). This thesis reviews the encephalitis etiology and presents the data on 83 with encephalitis treated at the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases “Dr. Fran Mihaljevic” from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2015. Results were compared to previouus data obtained from study covering 11-years period (2000 – 2010). Significantly difference in the number of etiologycaly confirmed cases were found.",

Other neurologic disorders must be ruled out before diagnosis can be established. HE is associated to nonspecific EEG abnormalities as well as elevated cerebrospinal fluid proteins and nonspecific white matter changes. The pathophysiology of HE is unknown but an autoimmune etiology is strongly supported. HE responds to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, further supporting an autoimmune etiology.

      "abstract": "Abstract Forty years into the HIV pandemic, approximately 50% of infected individuals still suffer from a constellation of neurological disorders collectively known as ‘neuroHIV.’ Although combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been a tremendous success, in its present form, it cannot eradicate HIV. Reservoirs of virus reside within the central nervous system, serving as sources of HIV virotoxins that damage mitochondria and promote neurotoxicity. Although understudied, there is evidence that HIV or the HIV regulatory protein, trans‐activator of transcription (Tat), can dysregulate neurosteroid formation potentially contributing to endocrine dysfunction. People living with HIV commonly suffer from endocrine disorders, including hypercortisolemia accompanied by paradoxical adrenal insufficiency upon stress. Age‐related comorbidities often onset sooner and with greater magnitude among people living with HIV and are commonly accompanied by hypogonadism. In the post‐cART era, these derangements of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal and ‐gonadal axes are secondary (i.e., relegated to the brain) and indicative of neuroendocrine dysfunction. We review the clinical and preclinical evidence for neuroendocrine dysfunction in HIV, the capacity for hormone therapeutics to play an ameliorative role and the future steroid‐based therapeutics that may have efficacy as novel adjunctives to cART.",

      "title": "The Whole Spectrum of Alcohol-Related Changes in the CNS: Practical MR and CT Imaging Guidelines for Daily Clinical Use",
      "abstract": "Alcohol addiction is the most common drug addiction. Alcohol passes both the placenta as well as the blood-brain barrier and is in multiple ways neurotoxic. Liver diseases and other systemic alcohol-related diseases cause secondary damage to the CNS. Especially in adolescents, even a single episode of severe alcohol intoxication (\"binge drinking\") may result in life-threatening neurological consequences. Alcohol-related brain and spinal cord diseases derive from multiple causes including impairment of the cellular metabolism, often aggravated by hypovitaminosis, altered neurotransmission, myelination and synaptogenesis as well as alterations in gene expression. Modern radiological diagnostics, MRI in particular, can detect the resulting alterations in the CNS with a high sensitivity. Morphological aspects often strongly correlate with clinical symptoms of the patient. It is less commonly known that many diseases considered as \"typically alcohol-related\", such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, are to a large extent not alcohol-induced. Visible CNS alterations are thus non-pathognomonic and demand careful evaluation of differential diagnoses. This review article elucidates the pathogenesis, clinical aspects and radiological image features of the most common alcohol-related CNS diseases and their differential diagnoses. <b>Key Points:</b> • Alcohol-associated changes in the CNS are common and radiologically assessable. • They are often subtle and allow multiple differential diagnoses besides alcohol consumption. • Knowledge of clinical exams and lab results is crucial for diagnostic accuracy. <b>Citation Format:</b> • Keil VC, Greschus S, Schneider C et al.

We describe a 58-year-old male with previous IgG4-disease presentation who was diagnosed with progressive sensorineural hearing loss. The condition evolved rapidly despite proper, conventional therapy. The patient acquired vestibular symptoms and other cranial nerve deficiencies and he was diagnosed with intracranial lymphoma, mainly in the cerebellar region. This case demonstrates that rare intracranial lymphoma can present initially as sensorineural hearing loss. A higher suspicion for malignancy should be held in mind for patients with a history of IgG4-related diseases and for patients presenting with progressing bilateral SSNHL that is not responding to therapy.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "Encephalitis is inflammation of brain parenchyma. Besides viral infection as a main causative agent, for the last 15 years, autoimmune encephalitides have been described as a specific entity. Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (anti-NMDA-R) encephalitis is the main and most commonly diagnosed representative of autoimmune encephalitides. Disease mechanism is autoimmune with the primary target of the GluN1 subunit of NMDA-R. Typically it occurs in women aged 12-45 years. This autoimmune encephalitis develops due to an autoimmune reaction triggered by a tumour, mainly ovarian teratoma, or it develops as a post-infectious consequence of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). Before the development of symptoms, up to 70% of patients may experience prodromal symptoms followed by the first stage of the disease characterized by acute and bizarre symptoms from the spectrum of the psychiatric diseases. This stage of the disease can be easily misdiagnosed as psychiatric disease or substance use disorder. The aim of this study conducted at the Hospital for Infectious Diseases „Dr. Fran Mihaljevic“ was to analyze patients diagnosed with anti-NMDA-R encephalitis in the period 2012-2018. The median age of the patients was 9 years and 8 months. The average time which passed from disease onset to the diagnosis was 3 weeks.

      "abstract": "Contrary to earlier belief, muscle weakness and atrophy in critically ill patients is not due to inactivity or disuse but rather caused by neuromuscular disorders arising de novo during the stay in the ICU. Clinical manifestations include delayed weaning from the respirator and prolongation of the rehabilitation phase. The available data indicate that critical illness polyneuropathy is the most frequent cause of such secondary neuromuscular problems. For differential diagnosis prolonged neuromuscular blockade and several myopathies have to be taken into consideration. The pathogenesis of critical illness polyneuropathy is unknown. It has been suggested that the factors mediating the systemic inflammatory response are also responsible for axonal damage in critical illness polyneuropathy. We recently described a neurotoxic activity present in the sera of affected patients, which can be reversed completely by NMDA antagonists. The critical illness per se is unrelated to the development of neuropathy. By contrast, occurrence of myopathies may be triggered by exogenous factors such as high-dose glucosteroids and non-depolarizing muscle blocking agents. Detailed electrodiagnostic studies are desirable in patients with long-lasting ICU stays, whenever possible as weekly monitoring. In doubtful cases, muscle biopsy might be necessary for proper diagnosis and management.",

Some autoimmune diseases of the CNS are traditionally recognized as headache causes and therefore are included in the International Headache Disorders Classification. In other conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and Behçet´s disease, it is uncertain whether there is a causal relationship between headache and the immunologic disease. The presence of a headache history in a patient with an autoimmune disorder of the CNS may be only casual since primary headaches are very prevalent in the general population. In the other hand, CNS inflammatory activity associated with these autoimmune diseases maypotentially provoke headache and may also exacerbate a preexisting primary headache. In this article we make narrativerevision of the literature about this issue, presenting the current evidence of the association of headache and such immunologicdisorders, and critically discuss the potential therapeutic implications in the management of headaches in patients with these autoimmune diseases.",

This is not surprising, because just the words “infectious disease” tend to conjure up ideas ranging an average flu to more extreme symp- toms such as open sores or epidemics like the Black Death that swept through medieval Europe. A less common category of symptoms that often stem from these diseases are neurological complications, which can be far more serious and often deadlier than the rest if the disease is left to develop without treatment. Neurological components of infectious disease are symptoms that result when the disease attacks the brain or central nervous system. These symptoms vary in severity; they can cause headaches due to swelling of brain tissue and increased pressure, mental psy- chosis and atypical behavior, or an overall decrease in will we be able to prevent their spread and the ostra- cism of victims. T uberculosis : T he W hite P lague Although it is usually the unique and characteris- tic complications of each infectious disease that cause illness and eventually death, neurological symptoms have been historically perplexing as they are not read- ily apparent at the first signs of infection. Tuberculosis can present such seemingly unexplainable symptoms. The disease was previously and popularly known as “Consumption” because it seemed to consume the body from within, in addition to being coined the “White Plague” due to the pallor of victims’ faces. Spread through the air by coughs and sneezes, it is caused by mycobacterium and primarily affects the lungs in 75% of cases. Children or immunosuppressed individuals, however, may become infected in other areas, including the central nervous system (Golden and Vikram 2005). A common manifestation of the disease in these populations is meningitis, or inflammation of the meninges, which is the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord. The mycobacteria that cause Tubercu- losis travel to the brain and attack the tissues of the meninges, caus- ing them to swell as an inflamma- tory response. The most common symptoms are severe headache and fever, but if not treated quickly with antibiotics, epilepsy, deafness, and cognitive deficits can develop due to the pressure of the swelling inside the skull (Saez-Llorens and McCracken 2003). Tuberculosis became known as the major killer during the Industrial Revolution and was cited by fa- mous authors such as Edgar Allen Poe, who suffered many familial losses from the disease. The neurologi- cal symptoms were often overlooked during the era because the disease itself was poorly understood and no treatment had yet been discovered. Tuberculosis victims were thought to be crazed vampires, prey- B S J “Tuberculosis victims were thought to be crazed vampires, preying on their infected family members one by one and coughing up their blood. They often suffered from epileptic attacks and amnesic symptoms.” brain function due to the deterioration of brain tissue by disease-infected cells. In some cases, neurological symptoms are quite rare, as they present themselves years after infection. However, these complications are quite serious and especially prevalent in particu- lar diseases. Throughout history, there have been epi- sodes of contagious diseases causing mass hysteria not only due to their rapid spread and deadliness, but also to the resulting extreme mental and behavioral changes that were so poorly understood.

Neuromuscular syndromes related to ICU treatment consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and are now recognized as a frequent cause of newly acquired weakness in ICU patients. Clinical features include quadriparesis, muscle wasting, and difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Evaluation of these patients is based on knowledge of clinical setting and predisposing factors, focused neurological examination, detailed electrophysiological investigation, serum creatine kinase level, other laboratory studies as needed, and histological examination of muscle biopsy. If a central nervous system (brain or spinal cord) lesion is suspected, neuroimaging studies are required. In addition to conventional nerve conduction and needle electromyography, phrenic nerve conduction, diaphragm electromyography, blink reflex, and (recently) the technique of direct muscle stimulation have been employed. Critical illness polyneuropathy is an axonal motor and sensory neuropathy that often follows sepsis and multiorgan failure. Risk factors for critical illness myopathy are corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking drugs, acute respiratory illness, and organ transplant. Three subtypes (acute necrotizing myopathy, thick myosin filament loss myopathy, and type II fiber atrophy) are recognized. Major differential diagnoses of critical illness related paralysis are incidental Guillain-Barré syndrome and unmasked myasthenia gravis. Rarely, atypical presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, polymyositis or other myopathies, and precipitation of porphyria or rhabdomyolysis due to drugs used in the ICU have been described. Recently a poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis due to West Nile virus infection was reported. A subgroup of patients with myasthenia gravis with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody is noted to present as respiratory crisis. Muscle biopsy in ICU paralysis syndromes may be helpful in arriving at a specific diagnosis or to classify the type of critical illness myopathy. Nerve biopsy is only rarely indicated.",

      "abstract": "Long-term neurological complications, termed sequelae, can result from viral encephalitis, which are not well understood. In human survivors, alphavirus encephalitis can cause severe neurobehavioral changes, in the most extreme cases, a schizophrenic-like syndrome. In the present study, we aimed to adapt an animal model of alphavirus infection survival to study the development of these long-term neurological complications. Upon low-dose infection of wild-type C57B/6 mice, asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were established and compared to mock-infected mice to measure general health and baseline neurological function, including the acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition paradigm. Prepulse inhibition is a robust operational measure of sensorimotor gating, a fundamental form of information processing. Deficits in prepulse inhibition manifest as the inability to filter out extraneous sensory stimuli. Sensory gating is disrupted in schizophrenia and other mental disorders, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. Symptomatic mice developed deficits in prepulse inhibition that lasted through 6 months post infection; these deficits were absent in asymptomatic or mock-infected groups. Accompanying prepulse inhibition deficits, symptomatic animals exhibited thalamus damage as visualized with H&E staining, as well as increased GFAP expression in the posterior complex of the thalamus and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These histological changes and increased GFAP expression were absent in the asymptomatic and mock-infected animals, indicating that glial scarring could have contributed to the prepulse inhibition phenotype observed in the symptomatic animals. This model provides a tool to test mechanisms of and treatments for the neurological sequelae of viral encephalitis and begins to delineate potential explanations for the development of such sequelae post infection.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND- Whipple's disease may predominantly manifest with neurologic symptoms, especially myorhythmia and ocular movement disorders. Oculomasticatory myorhythmia and oculofacial-skeletal myorhythmia are well documented pathognomonic signs unique to CNS Whipple's disease. Vertical supranuclear ophthalmoparesis has been reported in many afflicted patients. Blepharospasm has not been reported as a presenting symptom. REVIEW SUMMARY- We report a patient with systemic Whipple's disease who exhibited almost exclusively CNS symptoms. The patient developed both ocular and skeletal myorhythmia without recognizable facial involvement. Later, despite aggressive antibiotic treatment, this patient developed severe aseptic meningitis, although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Tropheryma whippelii in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative. The movement disorders did not respond to antibiotics or to agents such as carbidopa-levodopa, valproate, carbamazepine, indomethacin, or clonaze-pam. CONCLUSIONS- This case documents the difficulty of early recognition, the spectrum of cardinal neurologic symptoms and complications, and the difficulty in managing of such patients. The role of CSF-PCR for Tropheryma whippelii remains controversial as a means to diagnose CNS Whipple's disease.",

Background slowing without slow-wave intrusion is seen with acute and chronic cortical impairments that spare subcortical white matter. Subcortical/white matter structural abnormalities or hydrocephalus may produce projected slow-wave activity, while clinical entities involving both cortical and subcortical regions (diffuse cerebral abnormalities) engender both background slowing and slow-wave activity. Triphasic waves are seen with hepatic and renal insufficiency or medication toxicities (e.g., lithium, baclofen) in the absence of a significant cerebral imaging abnormality, Conversely, subcortical/white matter abnormalities may facilitate the appearance of triphasic waves without significant hepatic, renal, or toxic comorbidities. More specific syndromes, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, autoimmune limbic encephalitis, autoimmune corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy with thyroid autoimmunity, sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, have imaging/EEG changes that are variable but which may include slowing and epileptiform activity. This overview highlighting EEG-imaging correlations may help the treating physician in the diagnosis, and hence the appropriate treatment, of patients with encephalopathy.",

The disorder differs considerably in etiology, physical findings, and, perhaps, prognosis, from the cortical blindness seen in adults. The same event that causes CVI by damaging the geniculate and/or extrageniculate visual pathways may also damage other areas of the brain, or the retina, optic nerves, or chiasm. Thus, children with CVI often have other neurological problems. Diagnosis may require the participation of a multidisciplinary team and the use of special visual testing techniques. Due to the uncertainty concerning the prognosis in CVI, clinicians should remain optimistic about the child's potential for some vision recovery.",

The K-Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administrated to detect behavioral and psychological disturbances observed by the caregiver. 58 subjects were analyzed: 43 were classified as aMCI and 15 as naMCI. About 76% of MCI patients had some neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated with the NPI and the most prevalent symptom was depression, followed by anxiety & apathy. A significantly higher prevalence of hallucinations has been observed in the naMCI group in comparison with the aMCI group. Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of persons with MCI.

      "abstract": "Neurologists are often called to evaluate central nervous system [CNS] manifestations in patients with suspected or definite systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]. The manifestations are highly diverse and often have major prognostic consequences. The major difficulties are to determine if the given manifestation is primarily due to SLE activity in the brain, or a consequence of metabolic disturbances, infection, or corticosteroid use. The true incidence of CNS manifestations attributable to SLE is not entirely clear, but several studies show prevalence rate between 15-75%, depending on criteria adopted. For cognitive impairment, the prevalence ranges from 17-59%. Cognitive impairment may be attributed to emotional distress, corticosteroid use, active systemic disease or primary CNS dysfunction. These manifestations may occur even in the absence of other neuropsychiatric [NP] manifestations clearly attributable to SLE. The etiology of cognitive impairment may be related to autoimmune mechanisms, such as brain-specific autoantibodies. Despite several studies using computer tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], brain structural abnormalities could not be associated with cognitive findings in SLE patients. Functional neuroimaging methods may be more sensitive for detecting subclinical brain involvement related to cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment may be residual in patients with previous CNS involvement, it also may be an early marker of CNS involvement in previous asymptomatic patients. This article will review clinical assessment, pathogenic mechanism, and the role of neuroimaging methods in the evaluating of SLE patients with cognitive impairment.

      "title": "013 Differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia",
      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Dementia, as a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The majority of cases are due to neurodegenerative diseases and/or vascular disease with relatively gradual progressive clinical courses. However, dementia can be rapidly progressive with time courses measured in only weeks or a few months. These more rapidly progressive dementias often have clinical characteristics that are distinctive from the more typical slower dementias and with different aetiological considerations. There is no specific definition of “rapidly progressive dementia (RPD)”. This talk will review the differential diagnosis of RPD in adults. Infections must be considered, including HIV-associated dementia, PML, SSPE, Whipples disease and prion diseases. Malignancy enters into the differential diagnosis in a variety of ways: rapidly progressive brain primary neoplasm, cerebral secondaries, intravascular lymphoma and non-metastatic encephalopathy. There are a number of miscellaneous immunological/inflammatory disorders, including Hashimoto9s Encephalopathy, Morvan9s Syndrome and primary cerebral vasculitis. Some causes (such as malignancy) are relatively common and usually relatively easy to diagnose and some may be suggested by past medical history or clinical context (as with HIV) but there are also great rarities (like Whipple9s disease) that may be very difficult to confirm. Many of these conditions, especially other infections, will have helpfully differentiating systemic features, general test abnormalities, a CSF pleocytosis and brain imaging abnormalities. Primary and secondary malignancies should be demonstrable on cerebral imaging. Some conditions will have specific diagnostic tests such as HIV testing. Various antibody tests will be helpful in certain situations such as Morvan9s syndrome, Hashimoto9s encephalopathy and paraneoplastic syndromes. There are no specific, non-invasive tests for prion diseases in general, although genetic testing is available for those associated with PRNP mutations. Clinical diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical features, EEG and cerebral MRI characteristics and CSF protein findings. In sporadic CJD, the EEG and CSF 14-3-3 testing have been the main relevant supportive tests, but certain brain MR appearances have been evaluated in recent times. In variant CJD, the brain MR Pulvinar Sign and tonsil biopsy have been most useful. Brain biopsy may be considered in a minority of cases. Autopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis of RPD, especially in prion diseases.",

In this series, vascular complications had a low prevalence, whereas involvement of the brainstem was common; spinal cord lesions, hemisphere lesions and meningoencephalitis also occurred. Optic neuropathy, vestibulocochlear and peripheral nerve involvement occurred, but were rare. The prognosis for recovery was in general good, and the majority of those followed-up over a median of 3 years (range 1–19 years) had only single attacks. One-third of patients underwent further attacks, and four underwent progressive deterioration leading to disability. Factors suggesting a poor prognosis are repeated attacks, incomplete recovery, progressive disease course and a high level of CSF leucocytosis during acute attack. These data should be of help in the further definition of the clinical characteristics of this rare neurological disorder and in the planning of treatment trials.",

      "title": "Neurology and the kidney",
      "abstract": "Renal failure is relatively common, but except in association with spina bifida or paraplegia it is unlikely to occur as a result of disease of the CNS. Renal failure, however, commonly affects the nervous system. The effects of kidney failure on the nervous system are more pronounced when failure is acute. In addition to the important problems related to renal failure there are both acquired and genetically determined diseases which may affect the kidney and the brain. Those acquired diseases include the vasculitides, the paraproteinaemias, and various granulomatous conditions (considered in other chapters of <i>Neurology and Medicine</i>). In two of the most commonly encountered genetically determined diseases, Von Hippel-Lindau disease and polycystic kidney disease, location of pathogenic mutations will provide improved screening programmes and, possibly, allow therapeutic intervention. Uraemia may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas the clinical features of uraemia are well documented, the pathophysiology is less well understood and probably multifactorial. Uraemic encephalopathy, which classically fluctuates, is associated with problems in cognition and memory and may progress to delirium, convulsions, and coma. The encephalopathy may initially worsen with periods of dialysis and almost certainly relates to altered metabolic states in association with ionic changes and possibly impaired synaptic function. Renal failure may affect the peripheral nervous system, resulting in a neuropathy which shows a predilection for large diameter axons. This may be reversed by dialysis and transplantation. The myopathy seen in renal failure, often associated with bone pain and tenderness, is similar to that encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Dialysis itself is associated with neurological syndromes including the dysequilibrium syndrome, subdural haematoma, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dialysis dementia, which was prevalent during the 1970s, has reduced in frequency with the use of aluminium free dialysate. With the introduction of transplantation and the concomitant use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs, the pattern of neurological problems encountered in renal replacement therapy has shifted. Five per cent of patients develop nerve injuries during renal transplantation, and up to 40% of patients experience neurological side effects from cyclosporine. Furthermore, CNS infections, often fungal in type, have been reported in up to 45% of transplant patients coming to postmortem. The nature of the involvement of neurologists with their nephrology colleagues is therefore evolving.",

Patients can experience a range of symptoms (e.g., mood disturbance, headaches, insomnia, vestibular symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction), and neuropsychiatric management relies heavily on nonpharmacological and multidisciplinary approaches. This article presents an overview of current nonpharmacological strategies for postconcussive symptoms including psychoeducation; psychotherapy; vestibular, visual, and physical therapies; cognitive rehabilitation; as well as more novel approaches, such as neuromodulation. Ultimately, treatment and management of mTBI should begin early with appropriate psychoeducation/counseling, and be tailored based on core symptoms and individual goals.",

NPH is associated with a classical triad of symptoms: dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Enlargement of the ventricles of the brain as seen on imaging studies is essential to making the diagnosis of NPH. NPH is most common in the elderly population. Making the diagnosis of NPH can be challenging, especially in elderly patients who may have other causes for their various symptoms. Once the diagnosis is made, tests can help to identify patients who are most likely to respond to the surgical placement of a shunt. Most cases of NPH are considered to be idiopathic as they have no identifiable, contributing cause. In other instances, NPH is said to be secondary; these individuals have a history of meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral hemorrhage, or head trauma.",

Of interest, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are 2 demyelinating conditions of the central nervous system (CNS), whose clinical similarity pose a significant challenge to definitive diagnosis. Yet, both remain important clinical considerations in patients with neurologic signs and symptoms in the context of recent vaccination.We report a case of a 50-year-old Caucasian male with a course of progressive, focal, neurologic deficits within 24 h after receiving the influenza vaccine. Subsequent work-up revealed the possibility of an acute central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating episode secondary to the influenza vaccine, best described as either CIS or ADEM.Case reports of CNS demyelination following vaccinations have been previously noted, most often occurring in the context of recent influenza vaccination. This report serves to document a case of CNS demyelination occurring 24 h after influenza vaccination in a middle-aged patient, and will describe some salient features regarding the differential diagnosis of CIS and ADEM, as well as their potential management.",

The nervous system is highly complex and physicians are sufficiently sophisticated with determining dysfunctions of individual subsystems of the nervous system.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysfunctions of the mitochondrial energy-generating machinery cause a series of progressive, untreatable and usually fatal diseases collectively known as mitochondrial disease. High energy-requiring organs such as the brain are especially affected, leading to developmental delay, ataxia, respiratory failure, hypotonia, seizures and premature death. While neural affectation is a critical component of the pathology, only discrete neuronal populations are susceptible. However, their molecular identity and their contribution to the disease remain unknown. Mice lacking the mitochondrial Complex I subunit NDUFS4 (Ndufs4KO mice) recapitulate the classical signs of Leigh Syndrome (LS), the most common presentation of mitochondrial disease with predominant CNS affectation. Here, we identify the critical role of two genetically-defined neuronal populations driving the fatal phenotype in Ndufs4KO mice. Selective inactivation of Ndufs4 in Vglut2-expressing glutamatergic neurons causes brainstem inflammation, motor and respiratory deficits, and early death. On the other hand, Ndufs4 deletion in GABAergic neurons leads to basal ganglia inflammation without motor or respiratory involvement, but accompanied by severe refractory epileptic seizures preceding premature death. These results provide novel insight in the cell type-specific contribution to LS pathology and open new avenues to understand the underlying cellular mechanisms of mitochondrial disease.",

Electrodiagnostic studies often reveal an asymmetric motor neuropathy with characteristic conduction block.

In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that patients do not require any treatment.

Surviving patients can be affected by deficits in various body organs and systems (e.g., lungs, heart, blood circulation) including the brain. Beyond neurological dysfunctions (e.g., stroke, encephalitis, encephalopathy, peripheral nervous system disorders), patients with COVID-19 can be affected by neuropsychological deficits. These deficits can involve (psycho)linguistic processes (i.e., neurolinguistic disorders) or other cognitive processes (i.e., non-neurolinguistic disorders), such as attention, executive functions, and memory. Regarding non-neurolinguistic disorders, most findings suggest the presence of attention and executive deficits. With respect to neurolinguistic disorders, patients can show deficits in spoken language processing (i.e., aphasia) or written language processing (i.e., alexia, agraphia). Nonetheless, many diagnostic and methodological issues should be addressed to explore further the epidemiology (prevalence, incidence, and demography), underpinning neurological causes (stroke, encephalitis/encephalopathy), and types and subtypes of neuropsychological disorders in patients with COVID-19. This chapter examines these issues as part of a wider review of what is currently known about neuropsychological disorders in adults who develop severe COVID-19 infection.",

One of the most common critical neuropathologies is hypoxic-ischemic and may be hemorrhagic. In both the acute and chronic phases, the differentiation from nonaccidental trauma needs to be evaluated. Evaluation is best achieved in a well-fixed brain. Some pathology cannot be seen macroscopically and requires microscopic sections.",

Here, we comprehensively review the relevant literature and report personal clinical observations to discuss the relationship between infection, peripheral inflammation, and cerebral and cognitive dysfunction in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Cognitive dysfunction in ME/CFS could result from low-grade persistent inflammation associated with raised pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may be caused by both infectious and non-infectious stimuli and lead to altered regional cerebral blood flow accompanied by disturbed neuronal function. Immune dysregulation that manifests as a subtle immunodeficiency or the autoimmunity targeting of one or more neuronal receptors may also be a contributing factor. Efforts to reduce low-grade systemic inflammation and viral reactivation and to improve mitochondrial energy generation in ME/CFS have the potential to improve cognitive dysfunction in this highly disabling condition.",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is, after the peripheral nervous system, the second most frequently affected organ in mitochondrial disorders (MCDs). CNS involvement in MCDs is clinically heterogeneous, manifesting as epilepsy, stroke-like episodes, migraine, ataxia, spasticity, extrapyramidal abnormalities, bulbar dysfunction, psychiatric abnormalities, neuropsychological deficits, or hypophysial abnormalities. CNS involvement is found in syndromic and non-syndromic MCDs. Syndromic MCDs with CNS involvement include mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactacidosis, stroke-like episodes syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers syndrome, mitochondrial neuro-gastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome, neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa syndrome, mitochondrial depletion syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and Leigh syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Friedreich's ataxia, and multiple systemic lipomatosis. As CNS involvement is often subclinical, the CNS including the spinal cord should be investigated even in the absence of overt clinical CNS manifestations. CNS investigations comprise the history, clinical neurological examination, neuropsychological tests, electroencephalogram, cerebral computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging. A spinal tap is indicated if there is episodic or permanent impaired consciousness or in case of cognitive decline. More sophisticated methods are required if the CNS is solely affected. Treatment of CNS manifestations in MCDs is symptomatic and focused on epilepsy, headache, lactacidosis, impaired consciousness, confusion, spasticity, extrapyramidal abnormalities, or depression. Valproate, carbamazepine, corticosteroids, acetyl salicylic acid, local and volatile anesthetics should be applied with caution. Avoiding certain drugs is often more beneficial than application of established, apparently indicated drugs.",

Cerebral infections may be accompanied by headache and are commonly associated with the development of either focal or generalized seizures. Fever may also be absent or intermittent in infectious cerebral disease, and clinicians should have a low threshold for considering these diagnoses in the appropriate context.

      "abstract": "Individuals with psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of HIV infection, inadequate treatment, and poor treatment outcomes. A recent study that compared patients at an HIV clinic who had received treatment for psychiatric disorders to patients for whom psychopathology had not been assessed or treated found that patients who were receiving treatment had significantly better rates of HIV treatment initiation and adherence, and they also tended to have a lower incidence of mortality. HIV infection and psychiatric disorders have the potential to reinforce and amplify one another: psychiatric disorders increase risk of HIV infection, and HIV infection contributes to depression, demoralization, and substance abuse. The current emphasis on checklist-based psychiatric diagnosis and treatment leads to the lack of recognition of important psychiatric care issues and also contributes to polypharmacy. Psychiatric disorders may be viewed from at least 4 different perspectives: as brain diseases, behavioral disorders, disorders of personality, or disorders of life experience. Disorders of life experience are common in the HIV clinic but are often difficult to recognize or treat using standardized diagnostic checklists. More effective management of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse would improve long-term clinical outcomes in patients with HIV infection. (Adv Stud Med. 2006;6(3A):S138-S144)",

Objectives This case aims to highlight the importance of assessing HIV comorbidity in patients with psychiatric onset pathology. Methods Case report and literature review. Results We present the case of a patient diagnosed with HIV in 1985, who after 20 years of disease with irregular adherence begins to present delusional ideation of harm and self-referential, control experiences, thought diffusion phenomena, and possible auditory hallucinations, with poor evolution despite the establishment of numerous antipsychotic treatments, which evolves over the years towards a confabulatory character and with progressive neuropsychological deterioration. After numerous admissions, and despite several treatments, the patient developed over time memory failures, bradypsychia, gait disturbances, and difficulties in self-care, which further aggravated his condition by hindering therapeutic adherence, which ended with the patient’s chronic institutionalization. Diagnosis was AIDS dementia complex. Conclusions HIV hardly replicates in the central nervous system but generates antigenemia which, in turn, generates an inflammatory infiltrate that can cause diffuse involvement, predominantly subcortical and limbic system. Usually, the dementia-AIDS picture is insidious and develops in patients with poor control of the primary disease. It is recommended to optimize antiretroviral therapy and neuroprotective agents, as well as symptomatic treatment by psychiatry. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

The presence of neurologic dysfunctions in HIV-infected people is not however necessarily a bad prognostic indicator and clinicians and neurologists need to identify causes and determine whether the presenting disorders are treatable. Similar clinical pictures can be attributed to many different causes and pathogenetic mechanisms depending upon the staging of HIV disease and the presence of opportunistic infections. Cranial neuropathies especially Bells palsy and inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathies such as Guillain-Barre syndrome are usually seen at seroconversion or during the asymptomatic stage. A rare form of leukoencephalopathy presenting as an intractable tremor and as steroid-responsive transverse myelitis was also seen at the authors institutions. Signs and symptoms thought to be classic for cytomegalovirus infection could be managed with AZT alone in a person with full-blown AIDS; recovery from a near-paraplegic state to full independence with urinary retention was achieved within eight weeks after AZT had been initiated. The authors note that early HIV invasion of the nervous system the coexistence of malnutrition and the use of neurotoxic agents may cause varied neurologic manifestations including cognitive and motor disturbances. These manifestations may also be modified according to racial differences virus strains socioeconomic status or educational status in the case of cognitive defects.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is a specific form of status epilepticus characterized by alteration in mental status and persistent seizure activity on EEG, with or without motor phenomena. Recognition of the consequences of nonconvulsive status epilepticus has attracted greater attention to this condition. We present a 24‐year‐old woman with epilepsy who developed nonconvulsive status epilepticus during pregnancy. Despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs, the seizures persisted and confusion deepened. Further workup to explain the etiology revealed the diagnosis as herpes encephalitis. She recovered completely by the third day of parenteral acyclovir administration. Herpes simplex encephalitis causing nonconvulsive status epilepticus in a pregnant, epileptic woman is an unfortunate and unusual condition, which was simultaneously complicated by the presence of multiple etiological factors.",

      "abstract": "HIV/AIDS is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. Since the start of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, active development of increasingly effective treatment approaches has changed the clinical course of this disease and its neuropsychological manifestations. HIV/AIDS is commonly associated with depression and may present with mania or psychosis. Fear of having HIV/AIDS is not unusual and requires sensitivity and supportive care by clinicians. In some cases, individuals may suffer with the delusion that they have HIV/AIDS; their apathy, lethargy, and loss of appetite and weight may result from psychopathology rather than from infection with HIV. The psychosocial consequences of this disease are substantial, and it is often difficult to disentangle the depression, anxiety, and fear that come with having the chronic disease from the mental status changes produced by HIV/AIDS itself and the myriad medical problems that frequently accompany HIV/AIDS.",

      "title": "Neurolymphomatosis and Anti-MAG Mononeuritis Multiplex in a Patient with Two Hematologic Malignancies (P6.284)",
      "abstract": "Damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is associated with hematologic malignancies and usually precedes their diagnosis. This damage can occur via direct infiltration of peripheral nerves by neoplastic cells resulting in a syndrome known as neurolymphomatosis (NL). NL is a rare manifestation of high-grade B-cell lymphoma but can also be seen in lower-grade B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and leukemia leading to various PNS pathologies (cranial neuropathy-painful polyneuropathy/polyradiculopathy-mononeuropathy-mononeuritis multiplex). On the other hand, hematologic malignancy-induced PNS damage can occur indirectly by monoclonal antibody production that cross-react with peripheral nerves' antigen targets. One such target is myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Anti-MAG antibodies are seen in up to 50[percnt] of IgM-related neuropathies and in lymphoproliferative disorders. While anti-MAG-induced neuropathy is primarily a demyelinating sensory ataxic one, axonal sensorimotor involvement has also been recognized. Here, we discuss the case of a 79 year old female who presented with progressive bilateral lower extremity pain and weakness. Electromyography/nerve conduction studies were consistent with mononeuropathy multiplex, without predominant demyelinating features. Magnetic resonance imaging of her spine showed right S1 nerve root swelling consistent with NL. Laboratory investigation revealed an IgM kappa monoclonal gammopathy and elevated anti-MAG titer (1:6400). She was referred to the hematology-oncology service where a bone marrow biopsy showed both chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Upon positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, there was avid uptake of the radioactive tracer in her spleen, both ovaries, and right L5-S1 nerve roots. Biopsy of the ovarian lesion diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma suggestive of transformation from WM. She was started on standard chemotherapy regimen (etoposide-prednisone-vincristine-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-rituximab) and after completion of 6 cycles achieved radiographic resolution of all PET scan lesions and symptomatic relief. This is the first report to describe the co-manifestation of NL and anti-MAG neuropathy in a patient with two different hematologic malignancies.",

In adults over 65 years of age, cognitive impairment without dementia is two to five times more common than dementia and occurs in approximately 11–27% of the population. Most studies suggest that the prevalence of cognitive impairment increases with age. For example, Unverzagt and colleagues reported that 29% of individuals between 65 and 74 years of age and as many as 55% of individuals over age 84 exhibited symptoms of cognitive impairment (without dementia).

It has been reported only once before in association with infectious mononucleosis. Well‐known neurological complications of infectious mononucleosis in all age groups include meningitis, Guillain‐Barre syndrome and encephalomyelitis, but a pure cerebellar syndrome is rare at any age. This paper reports a four‐year‐old girl with serologically‐proven infectious mononucleosis whose presenting symptom was severe ataxia, and who made a complete recovery after the resolution of her viral illness. RÉSUMÉ Mononucléose infectieuse comme cause d'une ataxie cérébelleuse aigue de l'enfance L'ataxie cérébelleuse aigue de l'enfance est une affection bénigne et limitée qui accompagne ou fait suite à des infections systémiques variées.

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition/Diagnosis criteria Excluded diseases Differential diagnosis Etiology Clinical description Genetics Diagnostic methods Frequency Genetic counseling Antenatal diagnosis Management including treatment Unresolved questions References Abstract Microcephaly is defined by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) below -2 standard deviation (SD) for age and sex. Severe microcephaly refers to an OFC < -3SD. Microcephalia vera (MV) and microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern (MSG) are genetic forms of isolated congenital microcephaly (< -3 SD at birth), with no extracerebral malformation. Their incidence has been estimated between 1/25 000 and 1/50 000 births. In MV, the brain is abnormally small because of a reduced number of neurons, but is keeping (sub) normal gyral pattern and has no other gross pathological abnormality. Mental retardation is usually moderate and in most cases, patients have no systematized neurological defects or seizures. Brain weight typically is < 500 g (1/3 normal) and OFC is between 24 and 29 cm at birth (normal OFC being higher than 32 cm). MSG has been misdiagnosed as MV or lissencephalies in the past. This disorder is defined by congenital severe microcephaly, reduced number and shallow appearance of gyri, and normal to thin cortex. Five types of MSG have been delineated on the basis of MRI and neurodevelopmental findings, but MV and MSG are likely to represent a continuous phenotype. Mental retardation ranges from mild and moderate (type 1) to severe (types 2 to 5). Pyramidal signs may be observed. Some forms (types 2 to 5) are associated with early-onset seizures and a poor prognosis. MV and MSG are due to abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation. In both types, the cortex is of normal (2.5 mm to 4 mm) or reduced thickness and has normal cytoarchitectonic appearance, with 6 layers of neurons, which contrasts with microlissencephalies or lissencephalies with microcephalies, characterized by an abnormal cortical thickness and an anarchic cytoarchitectony. MV and MSG are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, no locus has been associated with MSG. Eight loci have been associated with MV and among those, three genes have been identified, MCPH1, ASPM, SLC25A19.There is no specific treatment for MV and MSG.",

In pediatric patients MOG antibodies are detected in range of relapsing phenotypes including relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (RION), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis followed by optic neuritis (ADEM – ON), brain stem demyelination and aquaporin P4 antibody negative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-Ab negative NMOSD).MOG positive optic neuritis is frequently bilateral and associated with optic nerve head swelling.It is associated with neurological diseases like Multiple Sclerosis, ADEM or Transverse Myelitis.MOG antibody IgG is detected in serum by indirect fluorescence test.IV Methylprednisolone is the treatment of choice, if it fails to improve vision or if optic neuritis is recurring, then a combination of plasma exchange and IV Methylprednisolone should be considered.Long term immunosuppressants used for Prevention include corticosteroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab. The optimal preventive therapy has yet to be determined.Once the disease has been diagnosed, uncertainty remains over the best treatment approach and clinical trials for the pharmacological management of MOG- antibody optic neuritis are still needed.",

      "abstract": "acute leukoencephalopathy wIth RestRIcted dIffusIonAcute encephalopathy refers to acute insult to the brain and presents with seizures, impaired consciousness, and other neurological symptoms.Acute encephalopathy as a complication of common viral (rarely bacterial) infections often affects young children and causes death or severe neurological sequelae. [1]A correct diagnosis helps in institution of appropriate treatment and most importantly prognosis.The common causes of acute encephalopathy include febrile encephalopathy (viral meningoencephalitis, bacterial meningitis, tubercular meningitis, cerebral malaria, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM]), systemic disorders (dyselectrolytemia, hepatic/renal failure, and sepsis), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, toxins, poisoning, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.In the last two decades, many new entities that cause acute encephalopathy in children have been described such as ADEM, acute necrotizing encephalitis (ANE), fever-induced refractory epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), clinically Mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS), and autoimmune encephalitis. [2,3]cently, in the last decade, a new viral-associated encephalopathy, acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and restricted diffusion (AESD), has been described mainly from the Asian continent. [4]As the name suggests, this entity is characterized by a prolonged seizure with fever for 1-2 days followed by spontaneous improvement and this followed by worsening of clinical state with cluster of seizures, altered sensorium 3-4 days later.The second phase is characterized by areas of restricted diffusion on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Soon, there were reports of children presenting with acute encephalopathy, seizures, and restricted areas of diffusion on MRI at presentation itself but without the characteristic biphasic clinical picture.They had relatively severe clinical course and poor prognosis. [1]The label of AESD is not appropriate for this group.Presentation as acute encephalopathy, restricted areas of diffusion seen in both gray and white matter that is the hallmark of this condition, makes use of the term acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion (ALERD) more appropriate for this condition.Those occurring in the setting of an infection can be termed as infectious ALERD as similar presentation is seen with toxins such as cranial irradiation, therapeutic agents, and Treatment and outcome of children with acute encephalopathy depend on the cause, prompt treatment of the underlying cause, and use of adequate supportive measures.Many novel causes of acute encephalopathy are emerging where lumbar puncture, computed tomography of the head, and routine biochemical testing can be normal such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and febrile infection-related refractory epilepsy syndrome.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in the workup of children with acute leukoencephalopathy.Despite this in few cases, a correct diagnosis is not possible and novel conditions have been described in the last decade.One such condition is acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and restricted diffusion also called as acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion.Here, the routine MRI sequences such as T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences can be normal.Here, we have reviewed the etiology, types, clinicoradiological features, and treatment of this condition.",

Under the umbrella of hypertensive encephalopathy, PRES is defined by reversible cerebral edema due to dysfunction of the cerebrovascular blood-brain barrier unit. The pathophysiology of PRES is thought to result from abnormalities in the transmembrane flow of intravascular fluid and proteins caused by two phenomena: one, cerebral autoregulatory failure and two, loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier. PRES is not a common disease in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS with only three previously reported cases. Both the HIV and end-stage renal disease appear to further compromise the blood brain barrier. Although uncommon, PRES recurrence has been described. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating recurrent PRES in a HIV patient on hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease.",

It can affect the entire neuraxis, and presentations in the acute phase are variable, although anosmia is a common manifestation. Encephalopathy is common in patients who are hospitalized and is often associated with multiorgan involvement. Immune-mediated encephalitis is probably underrecognized; however, viral encephalitis is rare. Other manifestations include stroke, seizures, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathies, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, which sometimes has atypical manifestations. Treatment is symptomatic, and immunotherapies have been used successfully in some patients. Long-term complications include dysautonomia, exercise intolerance, malaise, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, and mood disorders.Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 may occur in the acute setting and may be independent of respiratory manifestations. Immune-mediated syndromes and cerebrovascular complications are common. Large populations of patients are expected to have long-term neurologic complications of COVID-19, many of which may emerge only after recovery from the acute illness.",

The mechanisms of neurological complications of the acute period are direct viral damage, hypoxic damage, and immune damage due to the activation of inflammation, including autoantibodies. After the end of the acute phase of the disease, neurological complications in the form of asthenic syndrome, vascular syndrome, exacerbation of chronic diseases (deterioration of cognitive and communication functions in patients with autism, schizophrenia, exacerbation of autoimmune neurological diseases, aggravation of the condition of patients with tics, increased frequency of epileptic seizures in adults and children, resumption of epileptic seizures in patients who were previously in stable remission, the debut of epileptic seizures). These disorders are based on the following mechanisms: neuroinflammation, activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, -2, -6, -8, -10, -17, -18, CXCL10, CCL2), formation of autoantibodies, increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, mitochondrial dysfunction, adrenal and thyroid dysfunction, venous dyscirculation. In the treatment of neurological complications after a COVID-19 infection, it is advisable to use anti-inflammatory therapy, mitochondrial therapy (including the technique of intermittent hypoxic-hyperoxic therapy), detoxication, correction of hormonal status (primarily the state of the adrenal glands and thyroid gland), vasoactive therapy, and symptomatic therapy.",

As such, Fahr's syndrome (FS) is a rare neurodegenerative condition that clinically presents with varying neurologic, neuropsychiatric, and movement disorder features. FS is characterized by bilateral basal ganglia calcifications secondary to other conditions (e.g., endocrine and metabolic disorders, infectious diseases). This case will expand upon the literature of rare and poly-etiological presentations of NCD.A 75-year-old White male underwent neuropsychological evaluation due to concerns from his wife regarding sudden onset of diminished mood, anhedonia, hypersomnia, disinhibition, and idiosyncratic motor movements two years prior which worsened after contracting COVID-19. Patient has multiple co-morbid medical conditions including hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, intermediate hyperglycemia, prostate cancer (in remission), and history of a syncopal episode. Neuroimaging was remarkable for bilateral basal ganglia calcifications and white matter lesions.At the exam, patient exhibited hypomimia, ataxic gait, alogia, sporadic motor stereotypies, and motor overflow. Overall performance on the Meyers Neuropsychological Battery was Below Average with relative weaknesses in attention, memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, and motor functioning. Patient was diagnosed with Major NCD of unspecified etiology and instructed to continue consultation with neurology.This patient's cognitive difficulties appeared poly-etiological and are likely attributed to the combination of basal ganglia calcification, white matter changes, hypothyroidism, and COVID-19 which suggests the presence of FS. This case exemplifies the importance of considering multiple etiologies, including the implications of COVID-19 during the diagnostic process as more neurologic symptoms of COVID-19 are still being discovered.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a neurodegenerative disorder that selectively affects the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), consequently leading to optic atrophy and loss of central vision. The primary cause is a metabolic dysfunction of mitochondria due to mitochondrial DNA mutations affecting the respiratory complex I. Despite the metabolic defect is systemic and measurable in post-mitotic tissues, the disease is usually limited to the RGCs and leads to profoundly impaired vision. However, adjunctive neurological features may be present in a subset of LHON patients defining the so-called “plus” variant phenotype. The most frequent neurological features may be a multiple-sclerosis-like disease, basal ganglia involvement with dystonia or spastic dystonia and bilateral striatal necrosis, myoclonus, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, migraine and sensorineural hypoacusia. Neurological exam, brain MRI, MR-spectroscopy and other ancillary exams may be needed to well characterize the “plus” phenotype of LHON patients. The genetic bases of these LHON “plus” cases are currently unclear, but private mtDNA mutations and nuclear genetic variants may be relevant.",

      "abstract": "Various grades of cognitive impairment generally occur in older adults over the age of 55, where cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and/or hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular accidents are also common. Cognitive impairment occurs in various forms, from mild or amnesia such as forgetting today's date to more ominous and progressive forms, such as frank dementia. Over 5 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, most of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. It has been envisaged from the beginning that dementia or cognitive impairment has neurodegenerative origins. However, recent studies have indicated that dementia may have a mixed origin or may be preceded by vascular insult and then neurodegenerative pathology. From a pathophysiological standpoint, one of the puzzling questions in the field of cognitive impairment and comorbidities is that it is not clear whether cardiovascular comorbidity or cognitive impairment comes first. Cognitive impairment negatively affects mobility and fitness and this can potentially contribute to development of hypertension or/and diabetes. The present review examines this perplexing situation and tries to anser whether the comorbid conditions are innocent bystanders to cognitive impairment or they play greater causative roles. The rationale of the review is that it is possible to address these cardiovascular risk factors for dementia prevention and hence it summarizes the evidence related to cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive impairment.",

Very often the underlying pathology is reversible if an underlying cause can be removed, a peripheral nerve having the potential to regenerate over many months. In the interim, and sometimes indefinitely, discomforts must be treated symptomatically. Consequences such as Charcot joints and plantar ulcers may be seen if the distal limb sites are not protected from damage. Autonomic neuropathy causes syncope, bladder atony, anhidrosis and dry mouth. Persistent and severe neuropathic pain requires trial of the response to one or more of the range of drugs in the classes antidepressants, anticonvulsants and antidysrhythmics (pp. 106–107).",

Because some of the symptoms of HIV infection are similar to those of major depression, efforts to diagnose and treat major depression are further complicated. Moreover, major depression increases vulnerability to HIV infection by provoking high-risk behaviors, and it interferes with a patient's ability to comply with protocols for the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. HIV infection itself can disguise, help initiate, or exacerbate major depression. In this report, the interrelation between major depression and HIV infection is evaluated, the impact of this interrelation on adherence to HAART is described, and methods for effective treatment of psychiatric conditions in HIV-infected persons are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is defined as a painful condition caused by neurological lesions or diseases. Sometimes, neurological disorders may also be associated with neuropathic pain, which can be challenging to manage. For example, multiple sclerosis (MS) may cause chronic centralized painful symptoms due to nerve damage. Other chronic neuropathic pain syndromes may occur in the form of post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, and other central pain syndromes. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with dysfunction, disability, depression, disturbed sleep, and reduced quality of life. Early diagnosis may help improve outcomes, and pain control can be an important factor in restoring function. There are more than 100 different types of peripheral neuropathy and those involving sensory neurons can provoke painful symptoms. Accurate diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy is essential for pain control. Further examples are represented by gluten neuropathy, which is an extraintestinal manifestation of gluten sensitivity and presents as a form of peripheral neuropathy; in these unusual cases, neuropathy may be managed with diet. Neuropathic pain has been linked to CoronaVirus Disease (COVID) infection both during acute infection and as a post-viral syndrome known as long COVID. In this last case, neuropathic pain relates to the host's response to the virus. However, neuropathic pain may occur after any critical illness and has been observed as part of a syndrome following intensive care unit hospitalization.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is one of the most common neurologic complications of HIV, possibly affecting as many as 50% of all individuals infected with HIV. Two potentially neurotoxic mechanisms have been proposed to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HIV DSP: neurotoxicity resulting from the virus and its products; as well as adverse neurotoxic effects of medications used in the treatment of HIV. Clinically, HIV DSP is characterized by a combination of signs and symptoms that include decreased deep tendon reflexes at the ankles and decreased sensation in the distal extremities as well as paresthesias, dysesthesias, and pain in a symmetric stocking–glove distribution. These symptoms are generally static or slowly progressive over time, and depending on the severity, may interfere significantly with the patient's daily activities. In addition to the clinical picture, nerve conduction studies and skin biopsies are often pursued to support the diagnosis of HIV DSP. Anticonvulsants, antidepressants, topical agents, and nonspecific analgesics may help relieve neuropathic pain. Specifically, gabapentin, lamotrigine, pregabalin, amitriptyline, duloxetine, and high-dose topical capsaicin patches have been used in research and clinical practice. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of HIV DSP, thus facilitating the development of novel treatment strategies. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, and management of DSP in the setting of HIV.

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) can be considered a complex multi-organ disorder with highly variable extra-intestinal, including neurological, involvement. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric diseases are complications frequently reported. These manifestations may be present at the onset of the typical disease or become clinically evident during its course. However, CD subjects with subclinical neurological involvement have also been described, as well as patients with clear central and/or peripheral nervous system and intestinal histopathological disease features in the absence of typical CD manifestations. Based on these considerations, a sensitive and specific diagnostic method that is able to detect early disease process, progression, and complications is desirable. In this context, neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in the non-invasive assessment of central nervous system excitability and conductivity. Moreover, some of these tools are known for their valuable role in early diagnosis and follow-up of several neurological diseases or systemic disorders such as CD with nervous system involvement, even at the subclinical level. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the neurophysiological basis of CD using electroencephalography, multimodal evoked potentials, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The evidence examined here seems to converge on an overall profile of \"hyperexcitable celiac brain\", which partially recovers after institution of a gluten-free diet. The main translational correlate is that in case of subclinical neurological involvement or overt unexplained symptoms, neurophysiology could contribute to the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of a potentially underlying CD.",

The current pathogenic hypothesis is that the CNS lesions are immune mediated. The CSF may reveal no cells or pleocytosis and increased levels of proteins, and may exclude neoplastic cells and infections.

Due to the peripheral neuropathy, a decreased sensitivity or even complete anesthesia may be present resulting in, on the ophthalmological level, neurotrophic ulcers. We report the case of 2 sisters (JM and KM) presenting with HSAN with recurrent corneal ulcers. Unfortunately, genetic testing couldn’t be performed due to lack of means, but the clinical presentation and features were very favourable or even pathognomonic of this syndrome. The first cases or reported individuals presenting with congenital insensitivity to pain goes back to 1930’s. Five types of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy have been identified according to age of onset of symptoms, clinical features and affected gene. HSAN type IV also known as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) is the second most common HSAN. It is caused by mutation in the NTRK1(Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1) (TRKA) gene located in chromosome 1 (1q21-q22). It is characterized by repetitive hyperthermic episodes in infancy, and mental retardation is usually present, as reported in our case. Clinical symptoms of pain insensitivity manifest as tongue, lip and fingers biting, and self-inflicted injuries. Congenital insensitivity to pain is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by an absence or an altered response to pain. Individuals with this syndrome can presented self-inflicted injuries and auto-mutilation leading in some cases to severe disabilities. Long-term visual prognosis in CIPA patients is not assessed and there’s an important lack of data regarding ocular manifestation of CIP syndrome.",

A progressive course of multifocal weakness and sensory disturbances ensued. Electrophysiologic studies revealed a generalized asymmetric demyelinating polyneuropathy with secondary axonal loss. The patient was sequentially treated with plasmapheresis, high dose corticosteroids, intravenous immune globulin, and ganciclovir. His neuropathy progressed, and he died of a fulminant bronchopneumonia. At autopsy the patient had a multifocal cytomegalovirus polyradiculoneuropathy, with both demyelinative and necrotizing features. While cytomegalovirus may be associated with a variety of peripheral nerve syndromes, its clinical presentation as a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy is unusual.

      "title": "Understanding brain dysfunction in sepsis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sepsis often is characterized by an acute brain dysfunction, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes, which may induce significant alterations in vulnerable areas of the brain. Important mechanisms include excessive microglial activation, impaired cerebral perfusion, blood–brain-barrier dysfunction, and altered neurotransmission. Systemic insults, such as prolonged inflammation, severe hypoxemia, and persistent hyperglycemia also may contribute to aggravate sepsis-induced brain dysfunction or injury. The diagnosis of brain dysfunction in sepsis relies essentially on neurological examination and neurological tests, such as EEG and neuroimaging. A brain MRI should be considered in case of persistent brain dysfunction after control of sepsis and exclusion of major confounding factors. Recent MRI studies suggest that septic shock can be associated with acute cerebrovascular lesions and white matter abnormalities. Currently, the management of brain dysfunction mainly consists of control of sepsis and prevention of all aggravating factors, including metabolic disturbances, drug overdoses, anticholinergic medications, withdrawal syndromes, and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Modulation of microglial activation, prevention of blood–brain-barrier alterations, and use of antioxidants represent relevant therapeutic targets that may impact significantly on neurologic outcomes. In the future, investigations in patients with sepsis should be undertaken to reduce the duration of brain dysfunction and to study the impact of this reduction on important health outcomes, including functional and cognitive status in survivors.",

Clinical presentation depends on an individual's immune response and invasion location, with all possible involvement of meningeal, vascular, and/or parenchymatous tissues. Meningovascular neurosyphilis occurs when both the meninges and vasculature are affected and can lead to headaches, photophobia, neck stiffness, cranial nerve palsies, and/or ischemic brain infarctions due to infectious arteritis. The following report describes the rare case of a 32-year-old male patient presenting with multiple ischemic brain infarctions of varying ages. The stepwise diagnostic approach as described allowed the medical team to reach the final diagnosis of meningovascular neurosyphilis with concomitant acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This case emphasizes the importance of maintaining high clinical suspicion in all young adult patients who present with acute neurological deficits.",

      "abstract": "textabstractBij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking verwacht je een verhoogd risico op visuele verwerkingsproblemen door hun hersenschade of hersenontwikkelingsstoornis. Hierbij hoeft er op oogheelkundig niveau geen pathologie aanwezig te zijn, wat in de huidige kliniek cerebrale visuele inperking (CVI) wordt genoemd. CVI kan tot uiting komen in stoornissen van de visuele functies die leiden tot perceptie, de zogenoemde hogere visuele functies. Voorbeelden van hogere visuele functies zijn het detecteren van beweging, het herkennen van vormen en ruimtelijke orientatie. Huidige diagnostiek van hogere visuele dysfuncties, en dus CVI, vindt plaats door middel van neuropsychologische testmethodes. Het nadeel van deze testmethodes is dat zij alleen inzetbaar zijn bij kinderen met een ontwikkelingsleeftijd >4 jaar. Dit betekent dat hogere visuele functies bij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking, maar ook bij gezonde kinderen <4 jaar met een typische ontwikkeling, tot op heden niet of moeilijk getest kunnen worden. Het gevolg is dat de prevalentie van CVI in deze groepen waarschijnlijk onderschat wordt en dat kinderen mogelijk niet de juiste visuele ondersteuning en stimulatie krijgen.\nIn de huidige praktijk is het bestuderen van oogbewegingen en kijkgedrag een directe manier om visuele verwerking en oogmotoriek te beoordelen. Een vertraagde visuele verwerking wordt als een verhoogd risico op CVI gezien en het beoordelen van oogbewegingen kan dus worden gebruikt als een screeningsmethode voor CVI. Het nadeel is echter dat dit is gebaseerd op observaties zonder kwantitatieve uitkomstmaat. Voor dit proefschrift wordt er daarom voor het eerst gebruik gemaakt van een geautomatiseerde methode, waarbij oogbewegingen objectief worden gemeten. Op een tv scherm worden visuele stimuli gepresenteerd, terwijl infrarood camera’s de oogbewegingen detecteren. Instructies en feedback van de deelnemer zijn niet nodig, waardoor ook kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking kunnen worden onderzocht. Op basis van oogbewegingreacties kan er onderscheid worden gemaakt tussen normale visuele verwerking, vertraagde visuele verwerking en stoornissen in de oogmotoriek.\nDe resultaten van deze studie laten zien dat er een verhoogd risico bestaat van visuele verwerkingsproblematiek bij kinderen met een verstandelijke beperking, waarvan de ernst toeneemt met de mate van de verstandelijke beperking. Daarbij bestaat er een verscheidenheid aan visuele dysfuncties binnen deze groep. Kinderen met een ontwikkelingsstoornis en/of verstandelijke beperking zouden op jonge leeftijd al moeten worden gescreend en zo nodig naar onderzoekcentra voor slechtzienden worden verwezen voor verder onderzoek.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

The most common interpretation of the term implies a direct invasion of the brain by an infectious pathogen, most commonly, viral, fungal, or parasitic. The topic also includes examples of meningitis mediated by bacteria or other agents, which can produce extrameningeal symptoms such as lethargy or seizures, in which case, the combined term \"meningoencephalitis\" is used.There are also many examples of encephalitis not due to direct central nervous system (CNS) infections. Inflammatory processes due to an acute or chronic illness can result in an acute immune-mediated encephalitis, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), lupus cerebritis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Agents or conditions that produce slowly progressive CNS symptoms, such as tertiary syphilis or \"slow viruses\" (the prion protein encephalopathies), also are considered examples of encephalitis. Table 1 lists only a limited number of the many pathogens and pathologic conditions that can cause either acute or subacute encephalitis. In this discussion, we will mainly address examples of acute encephalitis related to direct CNS infection and para-infectious processes involving the CNS. These examples embrace the major portion of the spectrum of disease presentation, course, and recovery, as well as mechanisms of cerebral injury.In addition to the taxonomic classification in Table 1, causes of infectious encephalitis often are grouped according to the most common methods of transmission. \"Arboviruses\" are those spread by insect vectors, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and the equine encephalitis group (both by mosquitoes). Zoonotic causes of encephalitis not spread by intermediary insect vectors include many of the parasitic infections (larva migrans) and rabies. Community-acquired encephalitides, such as enterovirus, adenovirus, and late-childhood herpesvirus infections, generally are spread by person-to-person contact. Vertically transmitted pathogens include neonatal herpes simplex (HSV), rubella virus, and cytomegalovirus, and likely many other viral agents. Vertical, symptomatic transmission of WNV has been well documented. Finally, sexual transmission is the major mechanism of infection for adult herpes simplex type 2 virus and HIV (which can produce an acute, often transient, meningoencephalitis in the absence of opportunistic infection).Iconic examples of parainfectious encephalitis in children include ADEM and acute cerebellar ataxia. Variants of these conditions, such as acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, are reported primarily in adult and older adult populations. Parainfectious syndromes are differentiated in practice from acute infectious encephalitis based upon clinical history and a lack of supporting evidence for direct CNS invasion. In the case of ADEM, there is usually an antecedent illness or immunization, followed 2 to 30 days later by various focal neurologic symptoms, possibly accompanied by signs of meningeal irritation. The early presentation may be confused with acute infectious encephalitis, and some instances of each phenomenon may be categorized incorrectly. Lumbar puncture findings can be variable, ranging from normal to a mild or moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis with an elevated protein concentration. Acute cerebellar ataxia follows a similar course of antecedent illness, but with symptoms limited to the cerebellum (ataxia, nystagmus, and cerebellar dysarthria).Infectious, parainfectious, and primary inflammatory causes of encephalitis are typically considered mutually exclusive. However, the example of Mycoplasma-related encephalitis illustrates some difficulty in differentiating direct versus indirect mechanisms of CNS disease, and the magnitude of the topic. Although widely regarded as a parainfectious phenomenon with variable pathology, up to 2% of these patients have Mycoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which might indicate some direct CNS invasion. Mycoplasma is a prevalent pediatric illness and cause of encephalitis. One hundred and eleven of 1988 patients referred to the California Encephalitis Project (CEP) tested positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae; 76% of those affected were pediatric patients. (1)(2)Epidemiological data on encephalitis is organized according to identified agent. The CEP was initiated in 1998 for the collection of epidemiological data and is the most comprehensive database to date. It includes all referred immunocompetent individuals over 6 months of age and all clinical presentations, including chronic and slowly progressive encephalitis. Criteria for inclusion include encephalopathy or ataxia, plus at least one clinical finding (fever, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, CSF pleocytosis, abnormal neuroimaging, or abnormal EEG). By using a combination of CSF PCR, nasopharyngeal/throat specimen viral isolation, and acute and convalescent paired sera, all patients receive testing for herpesviruses, arboviruses, enteroviruses, respiratory viruses, measles virus, Chlamydia species, and M pneumoniae. Between 1998 and 2005, 1,570 patients were enrolled. A confirmed or probable causative agent was identified in only 16% of cases. Of identifiable causes, 69% were viral, 20% bacterial, 8% noninfectious (ie, autoimmune disease), 7% prion protein, 3% parasitic, and 1% fungal. Extensive testing procedures still revealed no identifiable cause in 63% of patients. (3) Among the more prominent causes of viral encephalitis, HSV accounted for only 2.5% of the CEP cases; in contrast, HSV was identified in 5% of 322 pediatric patients with acute encephalitis seen in one series between 1994 and 2005. (4)Epidemics of infectious encephalitis have always attracted much media attention, such as the WNV outbreak first seen in the United States in New York City in 1999. Between 1999 and 2007, 1,478 pediatric cases of confirmed WNV infection occurred in the United States, of which 443 (30%) had neurologic involvement. Of those with neurologic symptoms, there were three fatalities. Overall, children accounted for only 4% of reported WNV infection cases, with an estimated median annual incidence of 0.07 per 100,000. The pediatric fatality rate contrasts favorably with the 12% mortality rate from the 1999 epidemic, in which the majority of symptomatic cases were elderly people. WNV is now an epidemiological risk factor throughout the contiguous United States and the Caribbean. (5) Although WNV remains the most commonly encountered arboviral encephalitis agent, California encephalitis viruses have the greatest proportion of pediatric symptomatic infections (88% of cases), and eastern equine encephalitis has the highest overall mortality rate of 42%.The importance of local epidemiological information and seasonality cannot be ignored. Many cases of viral encephalitis either occur in epidemics, display a clear seasonal predilection, or both. For example, enteroviruses are most often seen in spring and summer; arthropod-borne illnesses, in the summer and fall. Respiratory virus-mediated cases often are specific to fall and winter. These elements of conventional epidemiological wisdom, however, should be subordinate to locally observed trends, such as cases of H1N1 influenza encephalitis observed during an out-of-season epidemic.In contrast, ADEM tends to be more sporadically observed than many infectious causes, although population data in the United States have supported a winter-spring predilection for the condition. Recent data from Canada, however, failed to show this seasonality. (6) The inclusion criteria for ADEM strongly influences reported incidence, producing wide variations, with a range of 0.2 to 0.8 per 100,000 children in the United States and Canada, and 0.07 per 100,000 in Germany. Antecedent infectious illness or vaccination typically is identified in 50% to 75% of patients. Presenting symptoms are highly variable, as the range of reported incidences of any one neurologic symptom in pooled study data suggest. Outcomes statistics are similarly scattered, with a 57% to 89% reported rate of full recovery.Infectious agents and parainfectious processes are presumed to mediate their acute symptoms through any combination of postulated mechanisms listed in Table 2. Evidence is best for the causes of fatal cases, in which wholesale parenchymal destruction is usually identifiable at necropsy, including direct neuronal and glial invasion with apoptosis, neuronophagia, vascular occlusion leading to infarction, and secondary effects of cerebral edema.Evidence supporting largely immune-mediated mechanisms of injury (cytotoxic antibodies, cytokine effects, etc) is less direct, and more evident in parainfectious/inflammatory causes of encephalitis. In ADEM fatalities, perivenular lymphocytic infiltration with local myelinolysis is a hallmark finding on pathology specimens. (12) Evidence supporting the concept of antibody-mediated mechanisms derives mainly from the clinical efficacy of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasmapheresis in the treatment of ADEM. Demonstration of antibody targeting precise CNS molecules in human ADEM and other demyelinating disease cases is scarce, with poor concordance, even between individuals who have similar syndromes. Existing knowledge of autoantibodies targeting specific CNS molecules is derived mainly from experience with paraneoplastic syndromes in adults, eg, anti-Yo, anti-Hu, and anti-Purkinje cell antibodies. These mechanisms, however, produce subacute encephalitis or cerebellitis distinct from typical pediatric ADEM. Even in children with classic postinfectious cerebellitis, fewer than half display anti-Purkinje cell antibodies.The lack of routinely detectable autoantibody in parainfectious CNS disease is likely attributable to both the large number of causative infectious agents and the multiplicity of possible targeting mechanisms. The latter may include both molecular mimicry and abnormal handling of normally occurring cellular antigens. For example, an invading virus may manufacture proteins that share epitopes with normal human myelin (mimicry), or may produce enzymes that cleave or misfold normal host proteins into immunologically unrecognized forms. For example, vaccinia virus core protein kinase cleaves myelin basic protein.Even more difficult is the isolation of cytokine effects in producing CNS injury. Interleukins 6 and 8, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor α seem to be among those cytokines most commonly identified as correlating with severity of disease course or outcomes across multiple causes of encephalitis, both infectious and noninfectious (eg, lupus cerebritis), but with high variability between specific agents. High concentrations of interleukins 6 and 8 can be found in the CSF of patients with Mycoplasma encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis. Higher titers in a small number of Japanese encephalitis patients seemingly correlated with a lower survival rate. It is unclear if cytokines are causative of further CNS injury or are active markers of disease severity.The typical presentation of acute encephalitis consists of any combination of altered mental status, seizures, other behavioral changes, weakness, sensory disturbances, or nonepileptic movement disorders, in the absence of an identifiable external cause, such as intoxication, traumatic brain injury, or psychosocial stressors. In the younger child or infant, symptoms may be even less distinct, and can include uncharacteristic somnolence, disinterest in feeding, weak suck, irritability, loss of head control, or abnormal eye movements. Further clinical clues may include the presence of fever (either acutely or in the 1–4 week interval before the onset of symptoms), or meningeal irritation (Table 3). However, these supporting clues may not be apparent upon first presentation. Because the clinical symptoms of encephalitis include a very broad range in both scope and severity, suspicion should be high in the approach to any child presenting with uncharacteristic behavior that is persistent and disproportionate to environmental and situational factors.Upon identification of a suspected case of encephalitis, a relatively short but critical series of steps should be executed, as summarized in Table 4. Additional facts to consider in the initial evaluation of the patient include seasonal presentation, history of immunosuppression, travel history, recent local epidemiological information, and presence of focal neurologic symptoms or deficits. Table 5 lists additional specific testing that should be routinely considered based upon protocols developed for the CEP and specific clinical settings. Table 6 lists, according to clinical clues, other viral causes of encephalitis that would require agent-specific testing if suspected.In patients in whom a parainfectious process is suspected, acute testing for demyelinating inflammatory conditions is increasingly popular. This testing is motivated by the increasing recognition of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating conditions, eg, neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease), which may be mistaken initially for ADEM. Signs that increase suspicion for MS-related conditions include the presence of exclusively white matter abnormalities on MRI (especially if monolesional), optic neuritis, isolated myelitis, a recurrent or polyphasic disease course, or postadolescent age. In these cases, standard lumbar puncture studies also include myelin basic protein assay and measurement of CSF immunoglobulins with oligoclonal banding, and concomitant serum protein electrophoresis. Although the presence of disproportionate oligoclonal antibody production within the CSF is more suggestive of idiopathic demyelination (eg, MS), this finding is not sufficiently specific to prove a diagnosis of MS because ADEM and other CNS inflammatory conditions, including CNS infection, can produce similar results. The neuromyelitis optica antibody often is present in cases having optic neuritis associated with spinal cord symptoms. Documented neuromyelitis optica antibody-positive patients also have presented with optic neuritis only.In following the standard evaluation of patients with symptoms of encephalitis, the diagnostic testing results most commonly encountered include either unremarkable or variable leukocytosis or lymphocytosis. Comprehensive metabolic panels often fail to demonstrate specific abnormalities. Some enteroviral infections can produce a sepsislike syndrome with more remarkable hematologic abnormalities. Neonatal HSV infections sometimes produce hepatic function abnormalities and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone can be seen in almost any encephalitic process, but is reported more commonly in St Louis encephalitis (primarily a disease of the elderly population) and WNV infections.Understanding clinical-anatomic correlations may be helpful in refining the differential diagnosis, because some causes of encephalitis display tropism for specific CNS tissues. Table 3 describes the cardinal symptoms of infection or inflammation in major anatomic subdivisions, as well as commonly used clinical terms. Although the anatomic localization is an important part of initial symptom recognition, neuroimaging plays an indispensable role, whether or not localizing clinical symptoms are present. In the very young child, clinically based neuroanatomic localization also can be notoriously difficult. Table 7 describes some classically cited agent-specific localization-related findings, identifiable by symptoms, neuroimaging, or both. However, a high degree of variability in clinical presentations mandates that the search for an etiologic agent cannot be confined strictly to those agents classically injurious to specific CNS locations.Neuroimaging, including MRI, early in the course of disease may sometimes yield false-negative results. For purposes other than identifying substantial cerebral edema, midline shift or hemorrhage, computed tomography imaging generally is not sufficient for the diagnostic workup of encephalitis.The lumbar puncture is the single most utilized test for the diagnosis of encephalitis. The primary results, however, generally lack specificity, and can be normal early in the course of the disease. In those patients displaying abnormal CSF results, the most characteristic findings are increased opening pressure, normal or elevated protein concentration, normal glucose level, and pleocytosis, which often begins with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and then converts to lymphocytic, or sometimes monocytic, predominance with progression of the disease. Although there are reported variations on this theme with certain etiologic agents, such as hemorrhagic pleocytosis with HSV, atypical lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus, or mononuclear leukocytes with echovirus or varicella-zoster infection, there are no pathognomonic CSF findings that help to differentiate infectious cases of encephalitis.The ability to obtain PCR amplification of viral DNA fortunately has added new usefulness to the lumbar puncture in encephalitis. This modality, however, requires clinical suspicion of a specific diagnostic entity, and is not available as a broad \"battery\" of testing. Additionally, viral DNA often is not recovered in certain stages of illness. For example, 5% to 10% of adult cases of HSV meningitis have negative PCR results upon the first lumber puncture. Furthermore, results often are not immediately available, and can take from 1 to 7 days or longer to be available. Hence, the decision to use specific antibiotic or antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir for suspected HSV meningitis, is still largely predicated upon clinical suspicion.Parainfectious encephalitis such as ADEM or acute cerebellar ataxia may manifest many of the same CSF findings as infectious encephalitis. However, pleocytosis tends to be less dramatic in most, but not all, parainfectious cases. When pathogen genomic material can be isolated from the CSF, the likelihood of a parainfectious or purely inflammatory etiology becomes remote.The most reliable standard for demonstrating causation of acute infectious encephalitis remains the pairing of acute and convalescent serum titers. A fourfold rise in titer, especially immune globulin M, against a suspected agent is most often considered diagnostic. This method is limited by the adequacy of follow-up and the accuracy of testing selection. Many patients are discharged and lost to close follow-up long before convalescent titers are obtainable. Of those tested, the causative agent may be missed by clinical suspicion-guided testing targeting other organisms erroneously.The priority in the treatment of acute encephalitis is the duality of clinical stabilization and containment of potentially damaging inflammatory processes. Because many patients present with any combination of seizures, delirium, autonomic instability, and respiratory irregularities, treatment of these acute symptoms often takes priority. This stabilization should not, however, delay addressing the suspicion of either an infectious or parainfectious condition and initiating appropriate treatment. Commonly, such patients are empirically treated with intravenous acyclovir while waiting for lumbar puncture, or while waiting for laboratory results, including HSV PCR. Either because of delays in obtaining these results, or because of the known false-negative rate of PCR testing of acute CSF specimens, many will complete the required 21-day course of acyclovir without a firmly established laboratory diagnosis.The emphasis on prompt treatment of possible HSV encephalitis should not overshadow a thorough search for clues to other causative agents. Table 5 lists some alternative considerations in the diagnosis of acute infectious encephalitis that might affect treatment options.Beyond the primary infectious considerations, ADEM ranks as the most likely cause of an acute encephalitis. The constellation of a temporally separate infectious illness or an immunization before the onset of symptoms, multiple encephalitic symptoms, and multifocal MRI abnormalities in both gray and white matter are highly suggestive (but not pathognomonic) for the diagnosis of ADEM. Treatment varies substantially from the approach to acute infectious encephalitis in that high-dose corticosteroids are a first-line treatment, followed by IVIG or plasmapheresis in cases refractory to corticosteroid treatment. The use of both IVIG and plasmapheresis remains unsupported by clinical trials; but IVIG has received wider acceptance as an alternative treatment at this time.The use of corticosteroids in the setting of nonherpetic infectious encephalitis remains controversial. Outside of single case reports, the only available supportive evidence for their use derives from the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a subacute/chronic encephalitis caused by polyomavirus JC that occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised HIV-positive patients.The maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (generally accepted as 70 mm Hg or higher over 2 years of age) is a critical issue in treating infectious encephalitis. Increased intracranial pressure is a variable finding in encephalitis. Preserving CPP by managing intracranial pressure is an important element of treatment. In a series of 20 children with meningitis or meningoencephalitis, 4 of 4 patients with CPP <50 mm Hg died, whereas 3 of 16 with CPP maintained at >50 mm Hg survived. (7)When symptomatic intracranial hypertension exists, conservative measures (head elevation, hyperventilation, and fluid restriction) are the most accepted strategies. Mannitol is used on a limited basis, as individual case reports and small series attest. However, the duration of use is limited by the dynamics of inflammation-related intracranial hypertension, with eventual breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the possible passage of osmotically active agents into the extravascular space. This outcome may result in the ultimate worsening of cerebral edema. If more conservative strategies fail and mannitol is unsuccessful also, isolated reports and small series (3–4 patients) attest to the successful use of craniectomy for decompression.The treatment of symptomatic seizures often becomes a focus of management in patients with encephalitis. In the CEP, 42% of patients manifested seizures. Of these, 62 patients eventually developed intractable seizures requiring barbiturate coma or anesthesia. This group of patients experienced a 32% mortality rate, compared with an 11% overall mortality rate for the entire cohort. Nearly every anticonvulsant agent known has been used in the treatment of patients with encephalitis-related acute symptomatic seizures. Those agents most easily administered are available in intravenous formulations and include benzodiazepines (midazolam, lorazepam, diazepam), barbiturates (phenobarbital, pentobarbital), anesthetic agents (propofol, ketamine, inhalant anesthesia), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, divalproex sodium, and levetiracetam. The typical approach begins with benzodiazepines upon recognition of either recurrent or prolonged seizure activity, followed by loading of a more sustainable anticonvulsant, with intent to maintain. Fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and, in some locations, phenytoin are still most commonly used anticonvulsants, but newer agents such as divalproex or levetiracetam are gaining acceptance.If either high therapeutic levels or apparently adequate dosing fail to achieve cessation of seizure activity, sedative or anesthetic agent infusions emerge as the next most likely treatment, including the use of midazolam, pentobarbital, propofol, or ketamine drips. During this phase of treatment, bedside EEG monitoring usually is obtained, motivated both by the prevalence of otherwise undetectable subclinical seizures in the comatose patient and the desire to achieve a burst-suppression EEG pattern as a measure of the adequacy of dosing.Often, other anticonvulsants are added to the treatment regimen, either as intravenous formulations or via nasogastric or other direct enteral route, during the escalation of the therapy with sedative-hypnotic and anesthetic agents. The use of polypharmacy is intended to achieve both more rapid seizure cessation as well as a more stable anticonvulsant configuration, facilitating the successful withdrawal of the anesthetic agent without seizure relapse. However, metabolic interactions can frustrate attempts to obtain therapeutic levels of any or all agents simultaneously in use.Inhalant anesthetics often are used as a treatment of last resort. Isolated use of ketosis or vagus nerve stimulation has produced limited results as well. In general, the longer the list of unsuccessful anticonvulsant interventions, the poorer the prognosis for full recovery and survival.Clinical outcomes of both infectious and inflammatory encephalitis range from full recovery to death. The accurate prediction of clinical outcome remains elusive. Nonetheless, several factors can be identified that strongly influence the potential for recovery: nature of the infectious agent or process, age of the patient, extent of primary cerebral and spinal cord involvement, presence of complicated cerebral edema, extent of cerebral perfusion and vascular injury, presence of other organ system disease and complications, and response to treatment modalities. The importance of the nonneurologic aspects of infectious disease in affecting outcome should not be underestimated. This association is especially true in neonatal encephalitis accompanied by sepsislike syndromes, infectious pneumonitis, or hepatitis, which may produce mortality rates >50%. Even among older children, pulmonary disease especially affects outcome, as in the Taiwanese enterovirus 71 epidemics, in which the worst survival rate was among those experiencing pulmonary edema in the acute phase of illness. (8)The question of future functional capacity is paramount for families of encephalitis survivors. In response to this question, much depends upon the causative agent. As a general principle, agents that produce more extensive cerebral necrosis (especially if bilateral hemispheric or brainstem injury is abundant) or vascular disease have worse functional outcomes.Otherwise, available statistics offer little guidance in anticipatory counseling. The specific etiologic agent does play some role; for example, >60% of patients who have HSV encephalitis develop some identifiable neurologic sequelae in some series. But among Taiwanese children affected by enterovirus 71, 80% had no detectable deficits when evaluated >2 years after the encephalitis. (8)The potential for more subtle long-term sequelae, even in cases where there are no obvious short-term deficits, remains a controversial topic. For example, of 86 Taiwanese children evaluated 3 to 7 years after enterovirus 71 meningitis or encephalitis, 20% manifested attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder–related symptoms, compared with only 3% of matched control subjects. (9) The incidence of similar neurologic complications in other causes of encephalitis remains largely undocumented at this time.",

The most common interpretation of the term implies a direct invasion of the brain by an infectious pathogen, most commonly, viral, fungal, or parasitic. The topic also includes examples of meningitis mediated by bacteria or other agents, which can produce extrameningeal symptoms such as lethargy or seizures, in which case, the combined term \"meningoencephalitis\" is used.There are also many examples of encephalitis not due to direct central nervous system (CNS) infections. Inflammatory processes due to an acute or chronic illness can result in an acute immune-mediated encephalitis, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), lupus cerebritis, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Agents or conditions that produce slowly progressive CNS symptoms, such as tertiary syphilis or \"slow viruses\" (the prion protein encephalopathies), also are considered examples of encephalitis. Table 1 lists only a limited number of the many pathogens and pathologic conditions that can cause either acute or subacute encephalitis. In this discussion, we will mainly address examples of acute encephalitis related to direct CNS infection and para-infectious processes involving the CNS.

Table 6 lists, according to clinical clues, other viral causes of encephalitis that would require agent-specific testing if suspected.In patients in whom a parainfectious process is suspected, acute testing for demyelinating inflammatory conditions is increasingly popular. This testing is motivated by the increasing recognition of pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating conditions, eg, neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease), which may be mistaken initially for ADEM. Signs that increase suspicion for MS-related conditions include the presence of exclusively white matter abnormalities on MRI (especially if monolesional), optic neuritis, isolated myelitis, a recurrent or polyphasic disease course, or postadolescent age. In these cases, standard lumbar puncture studies also include myelin basic protein assay and measurement of CSF immunoglobulins with oligoclonal banding, and concomitant serum protein electrophoresis. Although the presence of disproportionate oligoclonal antibody production within the CSF is more suggestive of idiopathic demyelination (eg, MS), this finding is not sufficiently specific to prove a diagnosis of MS because ADEM and other CNS inflammatory conditions, including CNS infection, can produce similar results. The neuromyelitis optica antibody often is present in cases having optic neuritis associated with spinal cord symptoms. Documented neuromyelitis optica antibody-positive patients also have presented with optic neuritis only.In following the standard evaluation of patients with symptoms of encephalitis, the diagnostic testing results most commonly encountered include either unremarkable or variable leukocytosis or lymphocytosis. Comprehensive metabolic panels often fail to demonstrate specific abnormalities. Some enteroviral infections can produce a sepsislike syndrome with more remarkable hematologic abnormalities. Neonatal HSV infections sometimes produce hepatic function abnormalities and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone can be seen in almost any encephalitic process, but is reported more commonly in St Louis encephalitis (primarily a disease of the elderly population) and WNV infections.Understanding clinical-anatomic correlations may be helpful in refining the differential diagnosis, because some causes of encephalitis display tropism for specific CNS tissues. Table 3 describes the cardinal symptoms of infection or inflammation in major anatomic subdivisions, as well as commonly used clinical terms. Although the anatomic localization is an important part of initial symptom recognition, neuroimaging plays an indispensable role, whether or not localizing clinical symptoms are present. In the very young child, clinically based neuroanatomic localization also can be notoriously difficult. Table 7 describes some classically cited agent-specific localization-related findings, identifiable by symptoms, neuroimaging, or both. However, a high degree of variability in clinical presentations mandates that the search for an etiologic agent cannot be confined strictly to those agents classically injurious to specific CNS locations.Neuroimaging, including MRI, early in the course of disease may sometimes yield false-negative results. For purposes other than identifying substantial cerebral edema, midline shift or hemorrhage, computed tomography imaging generally is not sufficient for the diagnostic workup of encephalitis.The lumbar puncture is the single most utilized test for the diagnosis of encephalitis. The primary results, however, generally lack specificity, and can be normal early in the course of the disease. In those patients displaying abnormal CSF results, the most characteristic findings are increased opening pressure, normal or elevated protein concentration, normal glucose level, and pleocytosis, which often begins with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and then converts to lymphocytic, or sometimes monocytic, predominance with progression of the disease. Although there are reported variations on this theme with certain etiologic agents, such as hemorrhagic pleocytosis with HSV, atypical lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus, or mononuclear leukocytes with echovirus or varicella-zoster infection, there are no pathognomonic CSF findings that help to differentiate infectious cases of encephalitis.The ability to obtain PCR amplification of viral DNA fortunately has added new usefulness to the lumbar puncture in encephalitis. This modality, however, requires clinical suspicion of a specific diagnostic entity, and is not available as a broad \"battery\" of testing. Additionally, viral DNA often is not recovered in certain stages of illness. For example, 5% to 10% of adult cases of HSV meningitis have negative PCR results upon the first lumber puncture. Furthermore, results often are not immediately available, and can take from 1 to 7 days or longer to be available. Hence, the decision to use specific antibiotic or antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir for suspected HSV meningitis, is still largely predicated upon clinical suspicion.Parainfectious encephalitis such as ADEM or acute cerebellar ataxia may manifest many of the same CSF findings as infectious encephalitis. However, pleocytosis tends to be less dramatic in most, but not all, parainfectious cases. When pathogen genomic material can be isolated from the CSF, the likelihood of a parainfectious or purely inflammatory etiology becomes remote.The most reliable standard for demonstrating causation of acute infectious encephalitis remains the pairing of acute and convalescent serum titers. A fourfold rise in titer, especially immune globulin M, against a suspected agent is most often considered diagnostic. This method is limited by the adequacy of follow-up and the accuracy of testing selection. Many patients are discharged and lost to close follow-up long before convalescent titers are obtainable. Of those tested, the causative agent may be missed by clinical suspicion-guided testing targeting other organisms erroneously.The priority in the treatment of acute encephalitis is the duality of clinical stabilization and containment of potentially damaging inflammatory processes. Because many patients present with any combination of seizures, delirium, autonomic instability, and respiratory irregularities, treatment of these acute symptoms often takes priority. This stabilization should not, however, delay addressing the suspicion of either an infectious or parainfectious condition and initiating appropriate treatment. Commonly, such patients are empirically treated with intravenous acyclovir while waiting for lumbar puncture, or while waiting for laboratory results, including HSV PCR. Either because of delays in obtaining these results, or because of the known false-negative rate of PCR testing of acute CSF specimens, many will complete the required 21-day course of acyclovir without a firmly established laboratory diagnosis.The emphasis on prompt treatment of possible HSV encephalitis should not overshadow a thorough search for clues to other causative agents. Table 5 lists some alternative considerations in the diagnosis of acute infectious encephalitis that might affect treatment options.Beyond the primary infectious considerations, ADEM ranks as the most likely cause of an acute encephalitis. The constellation of a temporally separate infectious illness or an immunization before the onset of symptoms, multiple encephalitic symptoms, and multifocal MRI abnormalities in both gray and white matter are highly suggestive (but not pathognomonic) for the diagnosis of ADEM. Treatment varies substantially from the approach to acute infectious encephalitis in that high-dose corticosteroids are a first-line treatment, followed by IVIG or plasmapheresis in cases refractory to corticosteroid treatment. The use of both IVIG and plasmapheresis remains unsupported by clinical trials; but IVIG has received wider acceptance as an alternative treatment at this time.The use of corticosteroids in the setting of nonherpetic infectious encephalitis remains controversial. Outside of single case reports, the only available supportive evidence for their use derives from the treatment of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a subacute/chronic encephalitis caused by polyomavirus JC that occurs primarily in severely immunocompromised HIV-positive patients.The maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (generally accepted as 70 mm Hg or higher over 2 years of age) is a critical issue in treating infectious encephalitis. Increased intracranial pressure is a variable finding in encephalitis. Preserving CPP by managing intracranial pressure is an important element of treatment. In a series of 20 children with meningitis or meningoencephalitis, 4 of 4 patients with CPP <50 mm Hg died, whereas 3 of 16 with CPP maintained at >50 mm Hg survived. (7)When symptomatic intracranial hypertension exists, conservative measures (head elevation, hyperventilation, and fluid restriction) are the most accepted strategies. Mannitol is used on a limited basis, as individual case reports and small series attest. However, the duration of use is limited by the dynamics of inflammation-related intracranial hypertension, with eventual breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the possible passage of osmotically active agents into the extravascular space. This outcome may result in the ultimate worsening of cerebral edema. If more conservative strategies fail and mannitol is unsuccessful also, isolated reports and small series (3–4 patients) attest to the successful use of craniectomy for decompression.The treatment of symptomatic seizures often becomes a focus of management in patients with encephalitis. In the CEP, 42% of patients manifested seizures. Of these, 62 patients eventually developed intractable seizures requiring barbiturate coma or anesthesia. This group of patients experienced a 32% mortality rate, compared with an 11% overall mortality rate for the entire cohort. Nearly every anticonvulsant agent known has been used in the treatment of patients with encephalitis-related acute symptomatic seizures. Those agents most easily administered are available in intravenous formulations and include benzodiazepines (midazolam, lorazepam, diazepam), barbiturates (phenobarbital, pentobarbital), anesthetic agents (propofol, ketamine, inhalant anesthesia), phenytoin, fosphenytoin, divalproex sodium, and levetiracetam. The typical approach begins with benzodiazepines upon recognition of either recurrent or prolonged seizure activity, followed by loading of a more sustainable anticonvulsant, with intent to maintain. Fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and, in some locations, phenytoin are still most commonly used anticonvulsants, but newer agents such as divalproex or levetiracetam are gaining acceptance.If either high therapeutic levels or apparently adequate dosing fail to achieve cessation of seizure activity, sedative or anesthetic agent infusions emerge as the next most likely treatment, including the use of midazolam, pentobarbital, propofol, or ketamine drips. During this phase of treatment, bedside EEG monitoring usually is obtained, motivated both by the prevalence of otherwise undetectable subclinical seizures in the comatose patient and the desire to achieve a burst-suppression EEG pattern as a measure of the adequacy of dosing.Often, other anticonvulsants are added to the treatment regimen, either as intravenous formulations or via nasogastric or other direct enteral route, during the escalation of the therapy with sedative-hypnotic and anesthetic agents. The use of polypharmacy is intended to achieve both more rapid seizure cessation as well as a more stable anticonvulsant configuration, facilitating the successful withdrawal of the anesthetic agent without seizure relapse. However, metabolic interactions can frustrate attempts to obtain therapeutic levels of any or all agents simultaneously in use.Inhalant anesthetics often are used as a treatment of last resort. Isolated use of ketosis or vagus nerve stimulation has produced limited results as well. In general, the longer the list of unsuccessful anticonvulsant interventions, the poorer the prognosis for full recovery and survival.Clinical outcomes of both infectious and inflammatory encephalitis range from full recovery to death. The accurate prediction of clinical outcome remains elusive. Nonetheless, several factors can be identified that strongly influence the potential for recovery: nature of the infectious agent or process, age of the patient, extent of primary cerebral and spinal cord involvement, presence of complicated cerebral edema, extent of cerebral perfusion and vascular injury, presence of other organ system disease and complications, and response to treatment modalities. The importance of the nonneurologic aspects of infectious disease in affecting outcome should not be underestimated. This association is especially true in neonatal encephalitis accompanied by sepsislike syndromes, infectious pneumonitis, or hepatitis, which may produce mortality rates >50%. Even among older children, pulmonary disease especially affects outcome, as in the Taiwanese enterovirus 71 epidemics, in which the worst survival rate was among those experiencing pulmonary edema in the acute phase of illness. (8)The question of future functional capacity is paramount for families of encephalitis survivors. In response to this question, much depends upon the causative agent. As a general principle, agents that produce more extensive cerebral necrosis (especially if bilateral hemispheric or brainstem injury is abundant) or vascular disease have worse functional outcomes.Otherwise, available statistics offer little guidance in anticipatory counseling. The specific etiologic agent does play some role; for example, >60% of patients who have HSV encephalitis develop some identifiable neurologic sequelae in some series. But among Taiwanese children affected by enterovirus 71, 80% had no detectable deficits when evaluated >2 years after the encephalitis. (8)The potential for more subtle long-term sequelae, even in cases where there are no obvious short-term deficits, remains a controversial topic. For example, of 86 Taiwanese children evaluated 3 to 7 years after enterovirus 71 meningitis or encephalitis, 20% manifested attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder–related symptoms, compared with only 3% of matched control subjects. (9) The incidence of similar neurologic complications in other causes of encephalitis remains largely undocumented at this time.",

It is now known that this disease occurs in two major forms: von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRNF), which used to be called `peripheral neurofibromatosis', typically presents with café-au-lait spots; and cutaneous neurofibromas. Many other manifestations of the disease are found, including skeletal deformities, central nervous-system tumours, hydrocephalus, and mental retardation or learning disabilities. The incidence of VRNF is 1/3000 live births, but 50% of patients represent new mutations. Bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis (BANF) is less common than VRNF but is important because of the associated tumours on the 8th cranial nerve. The care of patients with either form of neurofibromatosis requires the skills of a physician who is aware of the potential complications and who is empathetic to the psychological stresses which accompany this disease.",

      "title": "Improved MOCA Scores While on Clozapine Gains Insight into HIV",
      "abstract": "Many patients suffer from comorbid HIV and Schizophrenia diagnoses. Patients with schizophrenia and other psychosis are at increased risk of contracting HIV due to numerous psychosocial factors including increased frequency of drug use, increased rates of victimization, and increased propensity for high-risk sexual behaviors. In addition to deficits in functioning related to psychiatric illness, patients with HIV also suffer from virus-related neurocognitive insults. It is quite possible that inflammation associated with an untreated HIV infection could compound the pre-existing neurocognitive decline seen in patients with schizophrenia and other psychosis, creating poor outcomes and treatment-resistant pathology. The benefit of clozapine treatment for schizophrenia patients with comorbid HIV extends beyond just symptomatic control. Long-term and consistent treatment of schizophrenia can be a stepping-stone for the improvement of many psychosocial aspects of life. Patients with well-controlled schizophrenia can lead relatively unaffected lives with improved insight and self-care. Improved insight allows patients to better understand their illness, treatment regimen, and follow-up needs. Improved self-care contributes to increased adherence to treatment regimens and overall health. It is likely that patients who are consistently treated for their schizophrenia will have an increased capacity to understand their HIV diagnosis. With gained understanding, these patients may be more likely to adhere to HAART therapy for HIV and to attend follow-up appointments with infectious disease or primary care. Furthermore, with adherence to HAART therapy, patients can enjoy an improved quality and duration of life by raising CD4 counts and preventing progression to AIDS or succumbing to AIDS-related opportunistic infections.A patient with schizophrenia and HIV diagnosis was monitored and interviewed with repeated MOCA scoring over a lengthy hospitalization period. During this time, he was titrated to an effective dose of clozapine totaling 400 mg at bedtime. His MOCA scores were compared over this period.In this case, we have observed that starting a patient on clozapine with therapeutic levels for adequate period has improved MOCA scores. Low MOCA scores could be due to untreated HIV, untreated underlying psychosis. Improved MOCA scores have led the patient to gain insight into his HIV diagnosis. For the first time, he felt the need to be on antiretroviral medication and understood the chronic nature of his illness.In conclusion, this case describes a patient with untreated HIV and comorbid schizophrenia who is started on clozapine to gain insight into his medical conditions and become more adherent with HIV HAART. The patient shows improvement in PANSS and MOCA scores, supporting an increased awareness of his illness and an increased ability to remain on treatment.No funding.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

It can also cause cranial peripheral neuropathy, multifocal radicular neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, spinal radicular neuropathy and myasthenia gravis, myopathy, etc. For these complications of the nervous system, diagnosis could be made by sufficient collection of disease manifestations combined with imaging, cerebrospinal fluid examinations, electro-encephalogram or electro myography to exclude infection or tumor progression. In the treatment of severe cases, ICIs should be discontinued and treated with high doses of glucocorticoid or gamma globulin with systemic support.

      "title": "Autoimmune Encephalopathies",
      "abstract": "Background: Evaluation of patients with recent onset of progressive cognitive and behavioral problems can be challenging. Psychiatric disorders, metabolic derangements, toxins and infections are generally considered in the differential diagnosis along with prion disorders (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and rapidly progressive degenerative dementias. Some subacute encephalopathies are caused by autoimmune or inflammatory mechanisms, recognized by the association with autoantibody markers and/or clear response to immunomodulatory treatment. This review describes the clinical features of these potentially reversible autoimmune encephalopathies. Review Summary: Morvan syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE), and nonparaneoplastic autoimmune limbic encephalitis have characteristic clinical and serological features. Limbic encephalitis is characterized by short-term memory impairment, complex partial temporal lobe seizures and psychiatric symptoms. Signal abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobes without contrast enhancement are the typical MRI findings. Morvan syndrome presents with behavioral changes, hallucinations, severe insomnia, autonomic hyperactivity and neuromyotonia (spontaneous muscle activity). Corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (sometimes called Hashimoto encephalopathy) has a broad range of clinical presentation. Cognitive impairment with tremor, seizures, stroke-like events (including transient aphasia) and normal thyroid hormone levels is a common scenario. In the absence of diagnostic serological findings, clinical improvement with corticosteroids may be the only evidence of autoimmune encephalopathy. Conclusions: Autoimmune encephalopathies are an important cause of rapidly progressive cognitive and behavioral decline that probably remain under recognized. Electroencephalography, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid examination and serological tests are useful diagnostic tools. With increased clinical suspicion, these diseases may be diagnosed and treated successfully.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a condition that results in brain damage in newborns due to insufficient blood and oxygen supply during or after birth. HIE is a major cause of neurological disability and mortality in newborns, with over one million neonatal deaths occurring annually worldwide. The severity of brain injury and the outcome of HIE depend on several factors, including the cause of oxygen deprivation, brain maturity, regional blood flow, and maternal health conditions. HIE is classified into mild, moderate, and severe categories based on the extent of brain damage and resulting neurological issues. The pathophysiology of HIE involves different phases, including the primary phase, latent phase, secondary phase, and tertiary phase. The primary and secondary phases are characterized by episodes of energy and cell metabolism failures, increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and activated microglia and inflammation in the brain. A tertiary phase occurs if the brain injury persists, characterized by reduced neural plasticity and neuronal loss. Understanding the cellular and molecular aspects of the different phases of HIE is crucial for developing new interventions and therapeutics. This review aims to discuss the pathophysiology of HIE, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the only approved therapy for HIE, ongoing developments of adjuvants for TH, and potential future drugs for HIE.",

Investigations of cognitive function and neuroimaging have begun to elucidate the nature of some of these symptoms. They reveal that, although cognitive deficits may be related to brain imaging abnormalities in some people, symptoms can also occur in the absence of objective cognitive deficits or neuroimaging changes. Furthermore, cognitive impairment may be detected even in asymptomatic individuals. We consider the evidence regarding symptoms, cognitive deficits, and neuroimaging, as well as their possible underlying mechanisms.",

      "title": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis presenting with hypersexual behavior",
      "abstract": "Sir, Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare progressive demyelinating disease of the central nervous system associated with a chronic infection of brain tissue with measles virus. The disease is commonly seen in children and young adults. It is characterized by progressive intellectual deterioration, focal and/or generalized seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, and visual disturbances.[1] The presentation varies according to the age of the patient, and the diagnosis is often delayed in adults due to the atypical presentation. The hypersexual disorder is classically defined in persons aged above 18 years and is characterized by the recurrent and intense sexual urge irrespective of the situation persisting beyond 6 months.[2] The disease is usually associated with significant psychiatric ailments and also with central nervous disorders such as stroke, brain injury, and medications. SSPE presenting with hypersexual behavior is uncommon and is rarely reported in the literature. We retrospectively reviewed the data pertaining to four patients of SSPE treated at our hospital between 2012 and 2014. The diagnosis of SSPE is based on the Dyken's criteria.[3] SSPE is diagnosed, if the patient meets any three of the following five criteria: (a) Progressive intellectual deterioration with signs of myoclonus; (b) characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern; (c) elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) globulin levels; (d) elevated CSF measles antibody titers; and (e) brain biopsy suggestive of measles. The demographic profile and investigation findings of all the patients are summarized in the Table 1.Table 1: Clinical details of all the four patientsBriefly, all our patients are young adults of both sexes and hail from poor socioeconomic strata of the society. All the patients presented with classical behavioral abnormalities, scholastic regression, and a couple of them presented with the hypersexual syndrome. All the patients showed a characteristic EEG pattern of periodic lateralized epileptiform discharge sequences neuroimaging revealed nonspecific white matter hyperintensities in few patients. The paired serum and CSF samples for measles ELISA IgG were positive in all the patients confirming the diagnosis of SSPE. The patients were treated with intrathecal interferon, Isoprinosine, and antipsychotic drugs including risperidone. Sodium valproate was used to control the myoclonus and seizure activity. One patient had a persistent worsening illness with recurrent seizures and succumbed to his illness at the end of 1-year of observation. Behavioral abnormalities improved in the remaining three patients, and they are under regular follow-up. In India, SSPE is still a common neurodegenerative disorder despite an increase in the measles vaccination. The diagnosis and treatment are usually delayed due to the varying presentation of the disease. Our data revealed that three patients were receiving psychiatric treatment for more than a year prior to the proper diagnosis. Poor scholastic performance and cognitive regression are important clues to the underlying diagnosis of SSPE and EEG is often diagnostic in these cases.[4] The clinical presentation of adult onset differs from childhood onset as, personality changes and ophthalmic manifestations are common presenting features and survival with treatment have been better in certain series.[5] Our data had patients from the second and third decades of life, and none of the patients had ophthalmic manifestations. Hypersexual behavior leads to social stigma and is often underreported by the patients. The same has been linked with a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, drugs such as dopaminergic agonists and other disorders including stroke and brain injury. The prevalence of SSPE is common among lower socioeconomic strata, large family size, and rural areas due to overcrowding. The measles virus is transmitted by respiratory secretions via aerosol exposure and also through direct contact with larger droplets.[1] A variety of metabolic disorders leads to dementia in young including Wilson's disease, hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency, etc. Our patients were investigated for these conditions and the negative screen resulted in the psychiatric diagnosis. It is essential for all the practitioners to look for myoclonus and also investigate for the rare causes of dementia such as SSPE and prion diseases. The therapy of SSPE involves the use of isoprinosine and an immunomodulator like interferon. The response to therapy depends on the clinical stage of SSPE at which the treatment was started. SSPE staging is done as per the modified Jabbour's classification and patients with stage 1 disease respond remarkably to the therapy whereas, stage 2 disease progresses invariably resulting in fatal outcomes in 2–5 years. To conclude, SSPE is a devastating disorder of public health importance in the developing countries. A high index of suspicion for SSPE is required during the evaluation of young adults with myoclonus, behavioral changes, and scholastic regression. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Progressive subacute encephalopathy due to human immunodeficiency virus (PSE-HIV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in perinatal HIV infection. Although current combined antiretroviral therapies do manage to check its progression, they often give rise to severe motor sequelae that are similar to the spastic infantile cerebral palsy resulting from other aetiologies. We present the case reports of four preschool age children suffering from this pathology who have benefited from long term treatment with botulinum toxin type A (BTA).Four patients suffering from early onset PSE HIV, who responded well to combined antiviral therapies, and who had severe motor sequelae (two cases of tetraparesis and two spastic dysplegias), with no cognitive disorders. The multidisciplinary treatment of their motor disorder included six monthly sessions of muscular injections of BTA in the usual doses, with good results from the functional point of view and with no significant side effects.PSE-HIV is defined by one of the following criteria: acquired microcephalus, retarded neurological development or symmetrical motor involvement. It constitutes one of the most frequent diagnostic criteria of AIDS in patients infected by vertical transmission. An early diagnosis and treatment are fundamental for the patient's prognosis. Severe motor sequelae in the form of spastic infantile cerebral palsy are frequent. In our experience treatment of the spasticity associated to this entity with BTA has proved to be useful and safe, with a clear improvement in gait functionality.",

      "title": "Aplicación de tecnologías asistenciales para el aumento de la capacidad de comunicación en personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor",
      "abstract": "La presente Tesis Doctoral describe una serie de desarrollos de Tecnologia Asistencial enfocados al fomento de la comunicacion de personas afectadas por trastorno neuromotor, en particular de aquellas con afectacion fisica muy severa. El trastorno neuromotor no es una enfermedad, sino un compendio de todas las lesiones cerebrales que afectan a la movilidad y a la postura de las personas, siendo la Paralisis Cerebral (PC) la patologia de mayor incidencia. Una de las caracteristicas del trastorno neuromotor es que una afectacion persistente y no progresiva surgida por un dano o una malformacion del cerebro en el momento del embarazo (trastorno congenito) o bien por una lesion del mismo (trastorno adquirido) producida por infecciones del sistema nervioso central, accidentes, etc. Por anadidura, estos desordenes psicomotrices suelen estar frecuentemente acompanados de trastornos sensitivos, cognitivos, del lenguaje, perceptivos, de conducta, y / o epilepsia. Es evidente que la psicomotricidad esta intimamente relacionada con la comunicacion (en sentido integral, la transmision de un mensaje que sea entendido por el receptor, ya sea este un humano o una maquina), puesto que en ella hay una serie de musculos implicados que se ven afectados. Cuando el acto de transmision se ve entorpecido por las manifestaciones clinicas del trastorno neuromotor, la calidad de la emision disminuye y por lo tanto es mas improbable que el receptor entienda el mensaje, cayendo el emisor (la persona afectada de trastorno neuromotor) en una reclusion social. Afrontar este problema de la incomunicacion en la que se encuentran muchos de los afectados por la paralisis cerebral y por las demas patologias englobadas dentro del termino “trastorno neuromotor” es uno de los grandes retos a los que se enfrentan diariamente tanto los afectados como sus familiares. La ingenieria permite el uso de tecnologia por parte de las personas con necesidades especiales, las cuales mejoraran sin duda alguna su vida diaria. Pero la tecnologia ha de introducirse con la premisa fundamental de que ha de ser accesible, tanto en terminos de diseno de sus interfaces de usuario (hardware y software) como en terminos de coste de adquisicion, operacion y mantenimiento. De todos los desarrollos tecnologicos posibles, esta Tesis Doctoral se centra en aquellos destinados a paliar las manifestaciones fisicas del trastorno neuromotor, las cuales pueden ser muy variadas: distonia (contracciones involuntarias de los musculos), espasticidad (contraccion permanente de algunos musculos), movimientos atetosicos (movimientos lentos y sinuosos)… Estas manifestaciones son de indole cualitativo, siendo complejo realizar una baremacion de las mismas, por lo que se realizan desarrollos diferenciados segun la severidad de la afectacion motora en los usuarios. En aquellos usuarios en los que la afectacion motora de las extremidades de los miembros superiores es moderada, los dispositivos moviles se erigen como la alternativa mas accesible para los usuarios desde el punto de vista de la accesibilidad, entendida esta tanto como la facilidad de operacion como la posibilidad de adquisicion por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. En particular, el SO Android sera el seleccionado por su amplia cuota de mercado y su orientacion Open Source para el diseno e implementacion de Sistemas Alternativos y Aumentativos de Comunicacion (SAAC) que aprovechen tanto las formas de interaccion de las pantallas tactiles como la conexion de pulsadores adaptados, asi como la potencia de las bases de datos SQLite para la creacion y gestion de tableros de comunicacion basados en el uso de pictogramas. En el caso de una mayor severidad de la afectacion del trastorno neuromotor sobre las extremidades, la falta de perifericos externos de los dispositivos moviles (principalmente por la juventud de estos) desaconseja su uso en beneficio de ordenadores personales, y en particular, la implementacion de ratones virtuales que permitan a los usuarios la comunicacion a traves de pictogramas o de teclados virtuales. Puesto que dentro de la severidad de las manifestaciones clinicas, cada afectado presenta deficiencias motrices muy diferentes, los gestos que se han de poder capturar para operar estos ratones virtuales han de ser variados. Los desarrollos software han de ser por tanto transparentes a estos metodos de entrada, ya sean estos gestos basados en movimientos oculares, movimientos cefalicos u otro tipo de senales biomedicas tales como ondas electroencefalograficas (EEG) o Electromiografia (EMG), metodos de entrada todos ellos contemplados en los desarrollos aqui descritos. Se describira el desarrollo de SAAC basados en la interpretacion de gestos, adecuados para afectaciones severas, como aquellos basados en la interpretacion de la actividad cerebral mediante dispositivos procedentes del mundo de los videojuegos, adecuados para aquellas afectaciones que imposibiliten de manera completa la operacion de cualquier otro metodo de seleccion y accesibles por una amplia variedad de economias familiares. Fomentar la capacidad de comunicacion entre personas no es sino el primer objetivo de los trabajos que aqui se describiran. El ser humano ha de ser capaz no solo de desenvolverse en un medio social, sino tambien de interactuar con su entorno mas inmediato. No es el objetivo de estos trabajos la generacion de tecnologia o de adaptaciones destinadas a la mejora de la autonomia personal (tales como ortesis robotizadas, sillas de ruedas electricas o exoesqueletos), es decir, la promocion de la participacion de las personas en las Actividades de la Vida Diaria (AVD), sino que el campo de investigacion se limitara a la comunicacion entre humanos y en particular, a la promocion de las habilidades sociales que se fundamentan en la edad infantil y primaria, edades que coinciden con la etapa de mayor plasticidad cerebral y generacion de sinapsis neuronales. El fomento de la capacidad de comunicacion sera empleado por tanto para la promocion del uso de estas herramientas de Tecnologia Asistencial generadas en un entorno educativo, de modo que las nuevas capacidades desarrolladas puedan ser utilizadas para la realizacion de actividades de entrenamiento cerebral que refuercen esta reestructuracion de las conexiones neuronales. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que es posible el manejo de interfaces de accesos a dispositivos por parte de personas distonicas, pero que es necesario un entrenamiento fuerte. Asi mismo, se describira como una exhaustiva y metodologica recopilacion de requisitos de los usuarios, incluyendo en este concepto tanto a las personas afectadas de trastorno neuromotor como a sus cuidadores formales e informales, conduce a la creacion de herramientas tecnologicas capaces de ser empleadas fuera de los entornos de grupos de investigacion y por lo tanto, capaces de ser operadas y mantenidas sin la intervencion de tecnicos cualificados en instrumentacion y en la interpretacion y adquisicion de senales. Finalmente, se esbozaran lineas futuras de desarrollo que sobrepasen la “simple comunicacion” con humanos, permitiendo la comunicacion con todo tipo de maquinas y abriendo un abanico de mejoras en la autonomia de la vida de las personas que va desde el control de la domotica, al control de sillas de ruedas, ortesis robotizadas o la realizacion de terapias de rehabilitacion cognitivas y/o fisicas.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem.Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits as dementia.Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM.In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglycemia have deleterious effect on the brain.Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits.Hypoglycemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.Chronic hyperglycemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function.The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia related cognitive dysfunction include, macro-and micro-vascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycemia on the brain, advanced glycation end products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress.Hyperglycemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus.Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM.The knowledge that diagnosis at early age, frequency of hypoglycemia, poor glycemic control and presence of risk factors which negatively affect cognitive functions in DM, will have important implications for treatment and for research purposes.",

      "abstract": "Although most patients recover from acute COVID-19, some experience postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC). One subgroup of PASC is a syndrome called \"long COVID-19,\" reminiscent of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a debilitating condition, often triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to years-long debilitating symptoms including profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive deficits, and orthostatic intolerance. Some are skeptical that either ME/CFS or long COVID-19 involves underlying biological abnormalities. However, in this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases. We also examine the bidirectional relationship between redox imbalance, inflammation, energy metabolic deficits, and a hypometabolic state. We speculate as to what may be causing these abnormalities. Thus, understanding the molecular underpinnings of both PASC and ME/CFS may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.",

Hyperthyroidism encephalopathy and hypothyroidism encephalopathy associated with thyroid dysfunction are rare in adults. Clinicians pay less attention to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism encephalopathy, which mainly present as mental and cognitive disorders, epileptic seizures, motor disorders and other nervous system symptoms as the first manifestation. These diseases are easily to be misdiagnosed. Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE) is a kind thyroid antibody-elevated and hormone-sensitive encephalopathy, has various clinical manifestations without specific auxiliary examination, and diagnosis can only be made by excluding other diseases. Whether HE is an independent disease remains controversial, as it is not clear whether thyroid auto-antibodies are specific to HE or the pathogenesis. Therefore, the present paper mainly focuses on the adult encephalopathy associated with abnormal thyroid function and thyroid antibody-associated encephalopathy.\n\t\t\n\t\tDOI: 10.11855/j.issn.0577-7402.2019.02.15",

      "title": "HIV pain management challenges and alternative therapies",
      "abstract": "HIV INFECTS 47,000 individuals annually in the United States.1 Although advances in treatment have improved quality of life for these patients, there's no cure for or vaccine to prevent HIV. Over the years, HIV has transformed from an acute disease to a chronic illness; patients are living longer with the disease and its many complications. This places a burden on the patient and healthcare system, necessitating careful monitoring of medications to prevent toxic effects and minimize complications. Of the myriad complications that result from HIV infection, the most commonly reported is pain.2,3 Many patients with HIV who report pain rate it as severe and say it decreases their quality of life.3 Alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are emerging as viable interventions for pain management in this population. This article highlights challenges and nonpharmacologic options in the management of pain in patients with HIV. Literature review Pain in HIV. Research indicates pain, both neuropathic and nociceptive, is a significant complication of HIV, affecting nearly 80% of patients with this diagnosis.3 Pain may be related to the effects of the virus on the body, antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections, or a combination of the three.4 Additionally, patients report pain in multiple body areas with differing degrees of severity. Research suggests this is caused by multiple pathologic processes at one time.4 The multifactorial nature of the etiology of pain in this population contributes to pain intensity and treatment challenges. Patients with HIV also report fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression due to chronic pain.5 These symptoms negatively affect quality of life and the ability to fulfill functional and emotional roles. A survey of HIV-positive adults reveals patients describe the pain as “frightful, unbearable, and intense” and report a loss of independence as a result.6 The combination of HIV infection and depression increases the likelihood of nonadherence to medication regimens, posing a serious threat to patients' health and well-being.7 Current pain management practices. Current treatment of pain in patients with HIV varies. Research indicates pain is often undertreated due to many factors, including fear of addiction by patients and providers.8 Some patients express concern that healthcare providers don't take reports of pain seriously.6 Others are hesitant to report pain for fear of being labeled as difficult.4 According to research, most patients with HIV in the United States have a low socioeconomic status, are members of ethnic minority groups, and are females.3 Traditionally these groups experience more pain and are undertreated for it.3 These demographic factors play an important role in the prevalence of HIV-related pain and its treatment. Because HIV is a chronic disease, patients are living longer with it and its comorbidities. Renal and hepatic impairment, which are common complications of HIV infection, pose additional problems for pain management. Due to their hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects, acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can't be safely used by all patients.9 As a result, clinicians must look elsewhere for pharmaceutical solutions to pain management. Additionally, several opioid analgesics, including fentanyl, morphine, codeine, and hydrocodone, have the potential to interact with some antiretroviral medications used to treat HIV.10 These issues complicate the management of pain in this population. Providers are recommended to follow the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for cancer pain in addressing pain in this population. Per these guidelines, the most common treatment for chronic pain in this population is opioids.11 However, only a small percentage of patients with HIV receive long-acting opioids for chronic pain, and even fewer indicate their pain is relieved by medications.8 This may be due to the fact that opioids have been suggested as a third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, which many in this population experience, according to recent studies.12 Treatment with opioids is problematic in this population due to the high incidence of substance abuse and the potential for interactions with other medications.10 Research indicates that HIV-positive patients with substance use disorders have lower pain tolerance, requiring higher doses of opioids to relieve pain.13 While the etiology of decreased pain tolerance in individuals with substance abuse remains under review, one landmark study offers a few explanations.14 First, patients with HIV and substance abuse may suffer from withdrawal from opioids and other drugs, resulting in increased pain. Additionally, pain in this subset of the population may be related to a history of physical or sexual abuse. Finally, patients in this group frequently present with higher levels of somatization of psychological issues and hypervigilance to pain, increasing pain levels and lowering tolerance to it.14 Although opioids remain the cornerstone of WHO treatment guidelines, emerging research indicates they aren't the safest solution.11 The use of opioids in these patients promotes neuronal damage and neuropathic pain.11 Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, researchers believe inflammation, viral infection, and neuronal hyperexcitability by opioids lead to neuronal damage over time. Patients diagnosed with HIV and opioid use disorders report more neuropathic pain than those without such disorders.15 Although opioids are recommended as a third-line treatment for neuropathic pain, according to a recent consensus report they remain first-line treatment in HIV-related pain, which is often neuropathic in nature.12 More research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of opioids for managing pain in this population. Nonpharmacologic pain management therapies Acupuncture. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which includes acupuncture, is a reasonable substitute for medication in patients with HIV-related pain. Acupuncture is used to treat chronic and acute pain, and complex regional pain syndrome.16 WHO recognizes acupuncture as a primary method of pain relief with minimal adverse reactions.17 Researchers have found that acupuncture improves patients' sense of well-being and functional status.17 The incidence of pain in patients with HIV may be due to nerve damage, which can be reduced by acupuncture.18 Additionally, acupuncture is used to treat nausea caused by antiretroviral therapy for HIV.19 Research has indicated acupuncture has a strong positive effect on mortality and attrition in this population.20 Acupuncture improves patients' quality of life by promoting resilience and fostering an environment of holistic, patient-centered care.21 Many patients indicate a lack of patient-centeredness leads to nonadherence to treatment plans and dissatisfaction with the patient-provider relationship. However, in settings where acupuncture is incorporated into care plans, patients report increased empowerment, stronger relationships with healthcare providers, and better medication adherence.21 Despite acceptance of acupuncture by WHO as an effective method of pain relief, few studies have examined its use in this population. One landmark study found no improvement in pain when acupuncture was used in individuals with HIV.22 However, this study was conducted nearly 20 years ago, and its results haven't been replicated. Given acupuncture's potential benefits and minimal adverse effects, it's reasonable to support exploration into its use in pain management for patients with HIV. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Many patients with HIV experience depression and insomnia in addition to chronic pain. The combination of these disorders increases the risk of suicide and nonadherence to antiretroviral medications.7 Additionally, insomnia may exacerbate pain.23 Studies show that CBT and mindfulness therapy, which are commonly used to treat depression, are also effective in reducing chronic pain and insomnia.23 Performed by a psychologist or other healthcare professional, this intervention uses cognitive and behavioral modification techniques to target negative thoughts and maladaptive behavior.24 The result of CBT is a change in the individual's emotions and resulting behaviors; when used for pain management it effectively reduces pain.24 Researchers have examined the effects of CBT on patient reports of pain, as well as the feasibility of incorporating CBT in care at HIV clinics.9 In this study, the CBT program included education about chronic pain, relaxation techniques, sleep management, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving skills.9 Participants in the study met with the psychologist for CBT during primary care visits. After participating in the CBT program, participants reported a decrease in pain intensity and pain-related anxiety, and reported their pain interfered with their daily functioning to a lesser extent than it had before the therapy. Patients also reported an increased acceptance of their pain.9 A similar study indicated the incorporation of CBT programs at primary care visits decreased patient reports of pain while increasing engagement in enjoyable activities, strengthening relationships with primary care providers, and improving treatment adherence.25 CBT programs in this study included education regarding daily goal setting and pacing of activities to reduce the incidence of pain, in addition to cognitive restructuring regarding the pain experience.25 This intervention improved quality of life and helped patients regain functionality. Another study concluded that weekly CBT sessions provided via telephone with a trained therapist may significantly reduce chronic widespread pain in patients with fibromyalgia.26 Such an intervention may be ideal for the HIV-positive patients who can't travel to therapy appointments due to socioeconomic restrictions, but further study is required. Psychotherapies such as CBT and mindfulness therapy may be safer alternatives for treatment than opioid analgesics and should be considered for patients with HIV. Given these promising new treatment options and potential damage caused by opioids, it's imperative that new studies be conducted regarding the effectiveness of CAM for pain relief in this population. CAM could augment pharmaceutical interventions for pain, reducing risks of interactions, substance dependence issues, and neuronal damage. Educational interventions Patient education is one of the primary roles for nurses, regardless of the healthcare setting, including medications and lifestyle modifications. A recent study suggests educating patients with HIV and their caregivers about the cause of the patients' pain may help reduce it.27 In this study, patients participated in nurse-led pain education groups. During the group sessions, patients and their caregivers received information about the cause of pain associated with HIV infection, methods to assess pain, myths about pain, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for treating pain. Following these sessions, patients reported a decrease in pain and an increase in their quality of life.27 Although further studies are needed to verify the impact of patient education on reports of pain, this intervention has the potential to be a safe and effective addition to pain management in this population. Implications for nursing The role of the nurse is to provide holistic, patient-centered care. When caring for patients with HIV, nurses must understand the implications of treatment modalities and their impact on quality of life and functional status. Nurses must advocate for treatments such as CAM that effectively relieve pain while causing minimal adverse reactions. Bonus content!

      "title": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy. Should we treat it?",
      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy is an alteration of the central nervous system as a result of hepatic insufficiency after the exclusion of other known causes, and occurs in patients with cirrhosis, acute hepatic failure or portacaval shunts.1 It is characterized by a range of different neuropsychiatric disturbances that can include impairment of the sleep-wake cycle, cognition, memory, consciousness, personality changes, motorsensory abnormalities, stupor and coma.1 Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is considered to be the first stage of this clinical course. It is defined as HE without symptoms on clinical/neurological examination but with mild cognitive symptoms and attention deficits that can be characterized by response disinhibition, and with impairments to working memory and visuomotor coordination.2-4 As suggested by Bajaj, et al., these symptoms are considered to reduce the safety2 and quality of life (QOL) of patients with cirrhosis3 and are considered to be a preclinical stage of overt HE.2,3 MHE has a high prevalence of 22 to 80% in patients with liver cirrhosis.2,4 It is a diagnosis that all physicians should be aware of, but there is a fine line between normal and pathological, which can be modified by factors such as education or other comorbidities. At present, many questions remain regarding patients with MHE. Should they receive treatment? What type of treatment should they receive? How long should they receive treatment? Are there preventive measures for these patients? With regard to the first question, several studies have shown a positive effect of treatment on cognitive abilities (Figure 1), quality of life,5 and driving ability (Figure 2),6 but its effect on patients’ ability to work or their risk of falling remains unproven.4 A summary of reports of treatment in MHE and its impact on psychometric variables is presented in table 1, which suggests that treatment should be considered. The next question that arises is the type of treatment that patients with MHE should receive. Many approaches have been proposed, including lactulose, rifaximin and probiotics, minimizing dietary protein, branched-chain amino acids,7 and L-ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA).5 Nonabsorbable disaccharides reduce the synthesis and uptake of ammonia by lowering the pH of the colon and also reduce the uptake of glutamine from the gut.4 Treatment of MHE with lactulose resulted in an absolute risk reduction of 21.7% and the number needed to treat was 4.6. Different studies have compared the use of lactulose with placebo or no in-",

      "abstract": "Abstract The case of a young man with bipolar disorder who recovered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome but subsequently developed extensive neurological sequelae is described. Key words: Basal ganglia, drug effects, Cerebellum, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, complications Introduction Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, idiosyncratic reaction, commonly associated with neuroleptic treatment. It is potentially fatal, with mortality rates of 10 to 20%. Most fatalities occur early - pneumonia and renal failure account for the majority of deaths during this stage. (1) Patients who survive NMS usually completely recover. (2) Long-term neurological sequelae after an episode of NMS are rare, and their clinical manifestations diverse. However, there has been no systematic research on the subject. Thus, the incidence and prevalence of post-NMS neurological sequelae are unknown. Case reports indicate that presentations vary from subtle neuropsychological deficits such as transient or persistent cognitive impairment, including organic amnesic syndromes, (3-5) to widespread cerebellar damage. (2,6,7) Persistent abnormal involuntary movement disorders, such as dyskinesias, rigidity, hypertonia, dysarthria, and tremors following NMS have also been described. (8-11) This report describes the case of a young man with bipolar disorder, who recovered from NMS, but subsequently developed extensive neurological sequelae. Case Report A 20-year-old, previously healthy, computer student developed symptoms of elation, overactivity, grandiosity, disinhibition, overspending, disturbed sleep, and poor self care over a period of 2 weeks without any apparent precipitant. A private psychiatrist diagnosed mania. Treatment commenced with a combination of oral and injectable haloperidol (total daily dose 10 to 40 mg/day) and lithium carbonate 600 mg/day. Carbamazepine 600 mg/day was added in a further effort to control symptoms. Manic symptoms subsided with this treatment, but after 3 weeks the patient developed a high-grade fever (39.4 to 40.5[degrees]C) and diffuse macular rashes. Carbamazepine was withdrawn. However, on the following day, the patient developed rigidity of the neck and back, rapidly extending to involve the whole body. All psychotropic medication was discontinued. The patient was treated with antibiotics and antipyretics, with little evident response. He was referred to the Department of Psychiatry at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research for further management. On admission, the patient was found to be febrile, and sweating profusely. He became progressively more rigid, mute, incontinent, unresponsive, and finally comatose. Investigations revealed leukocytosis, and a serum creatine phosphokinase isoenzyme MM (CPK-MM) level of 3730 IU/L (normal range, 30 to 140 IU/L). Other investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, urine/blood cultures, viral serology for herpes simplex virus (HSV), and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain were all normal. He was hypoxic (P[O.sub.2] = 45) and required respiratory support for 3 days. By the third day after admission, a diagnosis of NMS was made. Bromocriptine therapy 5 mg/day was initiated and gradually increased to 20 mg/day. This led to considerable improvement, with fever and rigidity subsiding over the following 3 to 4 weeks. Sensorium improved and the patient was able to recognise family members. He was able to comprehend language but, due to a severe dysarthria, was only able to communicate by gestures. The patient remained confined to bed and had minimal ability to move his limbs. Dyskinetic, choreoathetoid, and dystonic movements were noted for the first time during this period. The patient's recovery was further complicated by left lung collapse, secondary to an inspissated mucous plug, which was subsequently removed bronchoscopically. …",

      "abstract": "This preliminary report deals with a polyetiological and pathophysiologically multifacted encephalopathy that is fairly common and yet in need of identification as a clinical (but not nosological) entity: Mixed-Type Encephalopathy (MTE). MTE is a mostly acute condition, characterized by change of mentation (confusion, delirium, etc.) with little or no neurological deficit but with impressive diffuse EEG slowing. A variety of medical conditions lead to MTE, especially at an age above 50 years, but status-post-surgery (leaving aside cranial neurosurgery, but also cardiac surgery in view of common embolic cerebral pathology) may also result in MTE, especially with the use of general anesthesia. An attempt is made to analyze the plethora of contributory factors and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. All types of classical brain pathology such as strokes, meningitis-encephalitis and typical metabolic encephalopathies (hepatic, renal, etc.) and others must be excluded from the diagnosis of MTE. Special emphasis is being placed on behavioral and EEG criteria in the early state of impaired consciousness with subdivision into 4 types: obtundation, somnolence, morbid lethargy and delirium. Cases of MTE are best picked up by an interdepartmental consultation (liaison) service making use of neurological consultations and EEG assessment. The value of the latter cannot be overestimated in these cases, especially in view of the very limited contributions of neuroimaging methods. The prognosis tends to be good. Severe and fatal developments are usually due to intervening cerebral hypoxia or anoxia. In such a development, epileptic manifestations, which are usually absent or mild in MTE, can become quite prominent. A thorough multi-institutional and international study of MTE is already in the planning stage. It is hoped that preventive measures can minimize the cerebral complications.",

      "title": "Reversible dementias.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, more attention has been given to the early diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia which is essential to identify patients with cognitive symptoms who may have treatable conditions. Guidelines suggest that all patients presenting with dementia or cognitive symptoms should be evaluated with a range of laboratory tests, and with structural brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While many of the disorders reported as 'reversible dementias' are conditions that may well be associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, these symptoms are not always sufficiently severe to fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia. Thus, while the etiology of a condition may be treatable it should not be assumed that the associated dementia is fully reversible. Potentially reversible dementias should be identified and treatment considered, even if the symptoms are not sufficiently severe to meet the clinical criteria for dementia, and even if partial or full reversal of the cognitive symptoms cannot be guaranteed. In the literature, the most frequently observed potentially reversible conditions identified in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia are depression, adverse effects of drugs, drug or alcohol abuse, space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and metabolic conditions land endocrinal conditions like hypothyroidism and nutritional conditions like vitamin B-12 deficiency. Depression is by far the most common of the potentially reversible conditions. The review, hence addresses the common causes of reversible dementia and the studies published so far.",

      "abstract": "Reports regarding brain inflammation, known as encephalitis, have shown an increasing frequency during the past years. Encephalitis is a relevant concern to public health due to its high morbidity and mortality. Infectious or autoimmune diseases are the most common cause of encephalitis. The clinical symptoms of this pathology can vary depending on the brain zone affected, with mild ones such as fever, headache, confusion, and stiff neck, or severe ones, such as seizures, weakness, hallucinations, and coma, among others. Encephalitis can affect individuals of all ages, but it is frequently observed in pediatric and elderly populations, and the most common causes are viral infections. Several viral agents have been described to induce encephalitis, such as arboviruses, rhabdoviruses, enteroviruses, herpesviruses, retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, orthopneumovirus, and coronaviruses, among others. Once a neurotropic virus reaches the brain parenchyma, the resident cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, can be infected, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules and the subsequent immune cell infiltration that leads to brain damage. After resolving the viral infection, the local immune response can remain active, contributing to long-term neuropsychiatric disorders, neurocognitive impairment, and degenerative diseases. In this article, we will discuss how viruses can reach the brain, the impact of viral encephalitis on brain function, and we will focus especially on the neurocognitive sequelae reported even after viral clearance.",

Accordingly, mHE can be expected to interfere with a subject's working ability, especially in those occupations that require handiwork, and driving ability. Indeed, about 60% of blue-collar workers with mHE have been shown to be assessed as unfit for work compared to only 20% of white-collar workers, and about 50% of patients with mHE have been judged unfit to drive a car in several studies. mHE interferes with a patient's quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of developing overt HE as well as increased mortality.

It is characterized by alteration of consciousness and cognition, seizure or focal neurological signs. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased biomarkers of brain injury and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination.

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was administrated to detect behavioral and psychological disturbances observed by the caregiver.120 subjects were analyzed: 94 were classified as aMCI and 26 as naMCI. Subjects with aMCI were more compromised than those with naMCI on global cognitive functions. About 85% of MCI patients had some neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated with the NPI and the most prevalent symptom was depression, followed by anxiety. A significantly higher prevalence of hallucinations and sleep disorders has been observed in the naMCI group in comparison with the aMCI group.Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of persons with MCI and may be the earliest manifestation of different diseases, each one associated with different clinical profiles at the stage of MCI.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Mania occurs in higher rates among individuals with HIV/AIDS, especially with the progression of HIV infection, and constitutes an additional risk factor for facilitate the HIV spread. Objective To provide an overview of secondary mania in HIV-infected patients. Methods Literature review based on PubMed/Medline, using the keywords “HIV”, “AIDS” and “mania”. Results Secondary mania or AIDS mania may be due to illicit or prescribed drugs, CNS infection with HIV, medical illness, including opportunistic infections. Of these, HIV neurotoxicity has been proposed to be the most important factor in its pathogenesis. Mania AIDS differs from primary mania with regard to clinical presentation, course, management and prognosis. The authors will analyze them. Besides decrease to treatment adherence, maniac symptoms also predispose to HIV risk behaviors, which may lead to further HIV transmission. Importantly, the occurrence of HIV mania may announce the transition from HIV infection to AIDS perhaps before other clinical signs are evident. Early recognition and treatment of manic symptoms with mood stabilisers, antipsychotics and HAART improve quality of life, protect from further cognitive deterioration and decrease mortality. In these patients, medication side-effects toxicity, drug interactions, and adherence require special attention. Conclusions Mania has been associated with HIV/AIDS and in many instances acts as a barrier to achieving best treatment outcomes. Thus, psychiatrists need to be aware of the complexities involved in the emergence of manic episodes in HIV-infected patients in order to deal with them in the most appropriate and effective manner.

[1-3]\n\nFor the clinician, it is often difficult to arrive at a reliable diagnosis of the neurologic syndrome and to detect the underlying tumor. Neurologic signs and symptoms, although often stereotypic, are not specific. In two-thirds of cases the underlying tumor is not discovered until after the first neurologic symptoms. [4] Furthermore, the neoplasm may be small and difficult to detect. [5-7] PNS are frequently associated with serum autoantibodies reactive with neuronal antigens that are also present in the underlying tumor. These antibodies include (1) the anti-Yo antibody, also called type 1 anti-Purkinje cell antibody (PCA-1), APCA-1, or type I antibody; (2) the anti-Hu antibody, also called type 1 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-1) or type IIa antibody; and (3) the anti-Ri antibody, also called type 2 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-2) or type IIb antibody Table 1. A clinical diagnosis of PNS is supported by the finding of these specific anti-neuronal antibodies. The detection of these antibodies should also lead to a focused search for specific underlying neoplasms. [8-12]\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1. Criteria for identification of paraneoplastic anti-neuronal antibodies\n\n\n\nA major problem in comparing results obtained by different groups of investigators has been that individual laboratories have employed different laboratory techniques for detection of these antibodies. Although identification of these antibodies has rested on immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, not all laboratories have used Western blot analysis to identify the molecular weight of detected antigens. Furthermore, material from a number of animal species has been used, methods of preparing substrates for Western blot are not always spelled out, and concentrations of serum and …",

      "abstract": "Whipple disease is a rare, chronic multisystem infectious disease. The central nervous system (CNS) is secondarily involved in 43% of patients; 5% of patients have isolated or primary CNS involvement. The most frequent CNS symptoms are cognitive changes. Prosopagnosia is an inability to recognize familiar faces, in a person who does not have vision impairments or cognitive alterations. This relatively rare condition is usually related to vascular, traumatic, degenerative, or infectious lesions. We report a 54-year-old woman who presented subacutely with fever, headache, and seizures that led to a diagnosis of infectious meningoencephalitis. She improved temporarily on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but then developed a chronically evolving cognitive impairment with associative prosopagnosia as the major complaint. She had a history of sporadic abdominal pain and mild sacroiliac arthralgia. After a negative duodenal biopsy, we confirmed primary CNS Whipple disease by polymerase chain reaction and brain biopsy. We treated the patient with ceftriaxone for 15 days and then co-trimoxazole for 2 years. At 8-year follow-up, she had no further impairments, but continuing prosopagnosia. To our knowledge, this is the first description of isolated prosopagnosia in a patient with primary CNS Whipple disease. Because CNS Whipple disease can lead to serious, irreversible lesions if not promptly treated, clinicians must suspect the diagnosis, treat with long-term antibiotics, and follow patients carefully to prevent recurrence.",

These disturbances, grouped here under the term \"encephalopathy,\" may be overlooked while attention is devoted to reversing life-threatening imbalances in cardiac and pulmonary function. Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that encephalopathy is an independent predictor of mortality. Factors associated with encephalopathy include primary cerebral disorders such as stroke, trauma, and meningitis, or systemic derangements including sepsis, organ failure, and exposure to pharmacological agents and toxins. Although encephalopathy may resolve with treatment of the underlying disorder, there is mounting evidence that cerebral dysfunction persists beyond the acute phase of critical illness. ICU survivors often suffer chronic impairments in cognitive ability, suggesting occult brain injury. The pathogenesis and natural history of encephalopathy, still poorly understood, need further clarification to spur the development of effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Headache is one of the most common clinical manifestations of altered intracranial pressure (ICP). Any disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, flow, or absorption may lead to alterations in ICP and produce headaches. Severe headaches may accompany conditions of high or low ICP, which may be iatrogenic or pathological in origin. Some disorders produce unique symptoms that aid in their diagnosis, for example, the cough headache associated with hindbrain abnormalities such as Chiari malformations. The International Headache Society (IHS) (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, 2004) classifies these disorders as “Headache associated with nonvascular intracranial disorder” (Table 18–1). Patients may have worsening of a preexisting headache or may develop a new form of headache (including migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache) in close temporal relationship to a nonvascular intracranial disorder. Causality is not necessarily implied.",

      "abstract": "Combination therapy of peginterferon and ribavirin for HCV has been recommended as a first choice for chronic hepatitis C. INF therapy has been associated with various IFN-related adverse events, such as psychological disturbances. Beyond that preexisting mental disorders are considered risk factors for INF-alfa-induced severe psychiatric side effects such as depression and/or suicidality, consequently many of these patients remain untreated even tough they fulfil the medical criteria for antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The authors relate the case of a patient, 56 year's old, sent to infecciology consultation because she had alterations in abnormal liver function tests. She had a previous history of mental disorder with neurotic personality traits and she was treated with psychiatric medication. She had treatment for chronic hepatitis C with peginterferon and ribavirin as well psychiatric and psychotherapeutic support. A low sustained virologic response was obtained however the depressive picture has been difficult to handle so she had had already had a psychiatric hospitalization. There were several adverse life events that can not be forgotten as they certainly trigger and exacerbate the depressive symptomatology. We assume that psychiatric patients have more depressive symptoms before and during treatment compared with patients without no psychiatric history. This shows that this patients have an increase need for treatment with antidepressants and that a close cooperation with a psychiatrist is always needed.",

      "abstract": "New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is \"a clinical presentation, not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurological disorder, with new onset of refractory status epilepticus without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause.\" Febrile infection related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is \"a subcategory of NORSE that requires a prior febrile infection, with fever starting between 2 weeks and 24 h before the onset of refractory status epilepticus, with or without fever at the onset of status epilepticus.\" These apply to all ages. Extensive testing of blood and CSF for infectious, rheumatologic, and metabolic conditions, neuroimaging, EEG, autoimmune/paraneoplastic antibody evaluations, malignancy screen, genetic testing, and CSF metagenomics may reveal the etiology in some patients, while a significant proportion of patients' disease remains unexplained, known as NORSE of unknown etiology or cryptogenic NORSE. Seizures are refractory and usually super-refractory (i.e., persist despite 24 h of anesthesia), requiring a prolonged intensive care unit stay, often (but not always) with fair to poor outcomes. Management of seizures in the initial 24-48 h should be like any case of refractory status epilepticus. However, based on the published consensus recommendations, the first-line immunotherapy should begin within 72 h using steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, or plasmapheresis. If there is no improvement, the ketogenic diet and second-line immunotherapy should start within seven days. Rituximab is recommended as the second-line treatment if there is a strong suggestion or proof of an antibody-mediated disease, while anakinra or tocilizumab are recommended for cryptogenic cases. Intensive motor and cognitive rehab are usually necessary after a prolonged hospital stay. Many patients will have pharmacoresistant epilepsy at discharge, and some may need continued immunologic treatments and an epilepsy surgery evaluation. Extensive research is in progress now via multinational consortia relating to the specific type(s) of inflammation involved, whether age and prior febrile illness affect this, and whether measuring and following serum and/or CSF cytokines can help determine the best treatment.",

They are characterized by damage of different structures in patients, including motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions, or the muscles. As the disease progresses, the respiratory muscles are usually involved in the pathological process, which puts patients at risk of developing alveolar hypoventilation and respiratory failure. If patients have respiratory system disorders or there is a high risk of developing these disorders, such patients need therapy aimed at correcting such conditions. Difficulties in providing medical care to such children can lead to the development of life-threatening conditions.

Involvement of optic nerve, spinal cord, dorsal medulla, brain stem, diencephalon, or cerebrum.2. Positivity for Aquaporin-4. Rule out mimics.Aquaporin-4 testing is not available in most low-income countries which could be an obstacle for accurate diagnosis of NMOSD.Aquaporin-4 antibody could be detected by any of the following methods:1.

Neurocognitive impairment is multifactorial in chronic kidney disease. End-stage kidney disease and the actual process of dialysis can potentiate cerebral vascular changes including volume and electrolyte shifts and related dialysis disequilibrium. Cognitive testing is an important component of the clinical assessment to corroborate the history.

      "abstract": "Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease affecting nervous system in 5% to 10% of patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is accepted as the most sensitive method for detecting neurosarcoidosis. However, the most common findings in MRI are the nonspecific white matter lesions, which may be unrelated to sarcoidosis and can occur because of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and other inflammatory or infectious disorders, as well. Autopsy studies report more frequent neurological involvement than the ante mortem studies. The aim of this study is to assess electroencephalography (EEG) in sarcoidosis patients without neurological findings in order to display asymptomatic neurological dysfunction. We performed EEG on 30 sarcoidosis patients without diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis or prior neurological comorbidities. Fourteen patients (46.7%) showed intermittant focal and/or generalized slowings while awake and not mentally activated. Seven (50%) of these 14 patients with EEG slowings had nonspecific white matter changes while the other half showed EEG slowings in the absence of MRI changes. We conclude that EEG slowings, when normal variants (psychomotor variant, temporal theta of elderly, frontal theta waves) are eliminated, may be an indicator of dysfunction in brain activity even in the absence of MRI findings. Hence, EEG may contribute toward detecting asymptomatic neurological dysfunction or probable future neurological involvement in sarcoidosis patients.",

La prevalence est probablement sous-estimee a cause du phenotype extremement heterogene et d'une forme moins severe chez l'adulte. La forme adulte de la maladie est habituellement d'expression neurologique. On peut alors retrouver un syndrome cerebelleux (ataxie, troubles de la marche, dysarthrie), des mouvements anormaux, une cataplexie, des crises d'epilepsie, une dysphagie, une paralysie verticale du regard, ainsi qu'une deterioration cognitive evoluant vers une demence. Des symptomes psychiatriques non specifiques (manifestations psychotiques de type schizophrenique, etats depressifs ou maniaques, troubles obsessionnels compulsifs, troubles du comportement) y sont souvent associes. Cependant, la maladie NPC peut egalement se manifester sous la forme de troubles psychiatriques isoles. Ce tableau psychiatrique est le plus souvent atypique, s'associant a des hallucinations visuelles, une confusion mentale, une fluctuation des symptomes, une reponse inhabituelle ou paradoxale au traitement, une catatonie, ou encore a une alteration progressive. La decouverte recente d'un traitement, le Miglustat, permettant d'en ameliorer l'evolution, doit amener les psychiatres a la rechercher devant tout tableau atypique (en particulier tableau psychotique atypique). Cette revue complete de la litterature internationale vise a porter la maladie de NPC (plus largement, les maladies neurometaboliques) a leur connaissance.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection. These latter situations where movement disorders are the hallmark of general neurologic or systemic conditions is when clinicians may face challenges of diagnosis and treatment. Affected patients may present to the internists and other physicians, including neurologists not skilled in movement disorders, who may be unfamiliar with the phenomenology or differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "Neurological Manifestations of Influenza Virus and RSV Infections in Children",
      "abstract": ": The most significant viral contributors to acute respiratory tract infections in children are Respiratory Syncytial Viruses (RSV) and influenza virus, causing substantial seasonal respiratory infections annually. Furthermore, severe neurological complications, notably seizures and encephalopathy, can be attributed to these viruses. Children with chronic or pre-existing neurological conditions are particularly susceptible to increased morbidity and sequelae. An active area of research to date is focused on the potential mechanisms of viral neurological invasion, which could be relevant for future therapeutic strategies. Influenza virus is frequently an important cause of epidemic or pandemic disease causing high costs of hospitalization and primary care. Furthermore, different subtypes of influenza viruses can induce various influenza-associated neurological complications, varying from mild (i.e. headache) to severe (i.e. meningoencephalitis and acute necrotizing encephalopathy), both in adults and children. While affecting the respiratory tract, RSV can also give rise to neurological manifestations, potentially resulting in long-term neurological impairment. Neurological changes associated with RSV encompass seizures, lethargy, ataxia, febrile or epileptic states, central apnea, difficulties in feeding or swallowing, tone abnormalities, strabismus, abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid, and encephalopathy. Patients infected with RSV can also develop neuromotor difficulties or present learning impairment. In conclusion, viral respiratory infections can result in significant extrapulmonary symptoms, potentially leading to enduring health consequences in affected children. Substantial research efforts are necessary to prevent or treat these infections, particularly within the most vulnerable populations.",

Long‐COVID syndrome symptoms, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients undertaking or following chemotherapy for cancer (chemofog or chemobrain), as well in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The pathogenesis of brain fog in these illnesses is presently unknown but may involve neuroinflammation via mast cells stimulated by pathogenic and stress stimuli to release mediators that activate microglia and lead to inflammation in the hypothalamus. These processes could be mitigated by phytosomal formulation (in olive pomace oil) of the natural flavonoid luteolin.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases characterized by myoclonus, epileptic seizures, and progressive neurological deterioration with cerebellar involvement. They include storage diseases like Gaucher disease, Lafora disease, and forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). To date, 13 NCLs have been reported (CLN1-CLN8, CLN10-CLN14), associated with mutations in different genes. These forms, which affect both children and adults, are characterized by seizures, cognitive and motor impairments, and in most cases visual loss. In NCLs, as in other PMEs, central nervous system (CNS) neurodegeneration is widespread and involves different subpopulations of neurons. One of the most affected regions is the cerebellar cortex, where motor and non-motor information is processed and transmitted to deep cerebellar nuclei through the axons of Purkinje cells (PCs). PCs, being GABAergic, have an inhibitory effect on their target neurons, and provide the only inhibitory output of the cerebellum. Degeneration of PCs has been linked to motor impairments and epileptic seizures. Seizures occur when some insult upsets the normal balance in the CNS between excitatory and inhibitory impulses, causing hyperexcitability. Here we review the role of PCs in epilepsy onset and progression following their PME-related loss. In particular, we focus on the involvement of PCs in seizure phenotype in NCLs, highlighting findings from case reports and studies of animal models in which epilepsy can be linked to PC loss.",

      "abstract": "In an attempt to categorize the diverse neurological manifestations of Behçet's syndrome, a group of 10 patients was prospectively studied; the diagnosis of Behçet's syndrome was not known in any of them prior to their neurological presentation. A reasonably clear distinction can be made to divide the manifestations into three general categories with some overlap. Category I includes patients with increased intracranial pressure with or without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Category II are those presenting with a stroke. Category III are those patients who present with spinal cord involvement and CSF pleocytosis. Brainstem involvement was noted independently of the group. In general, patients with Neuro-Behçet's syndrome showed little ocular involvement. The course of the illness both in morbidity and mortality tended to be better in category I, and mortality was only seen in category II patients. In populations susceptible to the disease, the clinical categorisation proposed may alert the clinician to the possibility of neuro-Behçet's syndrome whenever patients with pseudotumour cerebri, dural sinus thrombosis, stroke in the young, unexplained myelitis or possible multiple sclerosis are encountered.",

The pathophysiology of cognitive impairment is not fully understood, multiple magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest associations of structural brain damage (especially of the cortical and deep grey matter [thalamus]) with cognitive dysfunction. In recent years MS is increasingly viewed as network disorder where lesions in or microstructural damage to strategic white matter tracts may cause a „multiple disconnection syndrome“ leading to impaired cognition. A brief assessment of cognitive function, for example by the BICAMS or SDMT, should be incorporated in patient management in daily clinical care. However, these brief test batteries cannot fully replace an extensive neuropsychological assessment that may be necessary in some circumstances, for example impending loss of employment. Pharmacotherapeutic options of cognitive impairment in MS are scant, and the impact of immunomodulatory therapy on cognition has not been systematically investigated. Current therapeutic approaches comprise cognitive rehabilitation programs as well as individual coping strategies. Internet-based cognitive rehabilitation could be a feasible and supplementary therapeutic tool in the future. Data on cognition in important MS differential diagnoses such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders are sparse.",

Risk factors associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy include playing contact sports, presence of the apolipoprotein E4, and old age. Although it shares certain histopathological findings with Alzheimer disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy has a more specific presentation (hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposited as neurofibrillary tangles, associated with neuropil threads and sometimes with beta-amyloid plaques). Its clinical presentation is insidious; patients show mild cognitive and emotional symptoms before progressing to parkinsonian motor signs and finally dementia. Results from new experimental diagnostic tools are promising, but these tools are not yet available. The mainstay of managing this disease is prevention and early detection of its first symptoms.

The inflammatory response to infectious diseases induces systemic events, including cytokine storm phenomenon, vascular dysfunction, and coagulopathy, that can lead to multiple-organ dysfunction. The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the major organs affected, and symptoms such as sickness behavior (depression and fever, among others), or even delirium, can be observed due to activation of endothelial and glial cells, leading to neuroinflammation. Several reports have been shown that, due to CNS alterations caused by neuroinflammation, some sequels can be developed in special cognitive decline. There is still no any treatment to avoid cognitive impairment, especially those developed due to systemic infectious diseases, but preclinical and clinical trials have pointed out controlling neuroinflammatory events to avoid the development of this sequel. In this minireview, we point to the possible mechanisms that triggers long-term cognitive decline, proposing the acute neuroinflammatory events as a potential therapeutical target to treat this sequel that has been associated to several infectious diseases, such as malaria, sepsis, and, more recently, the new SARS-Cov2 infection.",

Thereafter, throughout the twentieth century, further reports added to our understanding of the neuropathological consequences of a career in boxing, leading to descriptions of a distinct neurodegenerative pathology, termed dementia pugilistica. During the past decade, growing recognition of this pathology in autopsy studies of nonboxers who were exposed to repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury, or to a single, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, has led to an awareness that it is exposure to traumatic brain injury that carries with it a risk of this neurodegenerative disease, not the sport or the circumstance in which the injury is sustained. Furthermore, the neuropathology of the neurodegeneration that occurs after traumatic brain injury, now termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is acknowledged as being a complex, mixed, but distinctive pathology, the detail of which is reviewed in this article.",

      "abstract": "This chapter describes several neurocutaneous syndromes, including tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, Sturge–Weber syndrome, Von-Hippel–Lindau disease and ataxia telangiectasia amongst others. Tuberous sclerosis, also known as Epiloia or Bournville’s Disease, is an autosomal dominant multisystem disease it usually presents in childhood with a characteristic facial rash, adenoma sebaceum, seizures, and sometimes learning difficulties. Central nervous system lesions in tuberous sclerosis are due to a developmental disorder of neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Other organs such as the heart and kidney are less commonly involved. The condition has very variable clinical expression and two-thirds of cases are thought to be new mutations, therefore it is important to examine and screen relatives. Management may involve many specialists and close co-operation between specialists is essential. The neurofibromatoses are autosomal-dominant neurocutaneous disorders that can be divided into ‘peripheral’ and ‘central’ types, although there is significant overlap. The characteristic features of neurofibromatosis type 1 are café au lait spots, neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, osseous lesions, macrocephaly, short stature and mental retardation, axillary freckling, and associations with several different types of tumours. Sturge–Weber syndrome involves a characteristic ‘port-wine’ facial naevus or angioma associated with an underlying leptomeningeal angioma or other vascular anomaly. It affects approximately 1/20 000 people. There can be seizures, low IQ, and underlying cerebral hemisphere atrophy as a result of chronic state of reduced perfusion and increased oxygen extraction. Patients may present with focal seizures which are generally resistant to anticonvulsant medication and can develop glaucoma. Von-Hippel– Lindau disease is one of the most common autosomal-dominant inherited genetic diseases that are associated with familial cancers. Von-Hippel–Lindau disease is characterized by certain types of central nervous system tumours, cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas, and retinal angiomas, in conjunction with bilateral renal cysts carcinomas or phaechromocytoma, or pancreatic cysts/islet cell tumours (Neumann and Wiestler 1991). Other neurocutaneous syndromes discussed include Hypomelanosis of Ito, Gorlin syndrome, Sjogren–Larsson syndrome, Proteus syndrome, Hemiatrophy and hemihypertrophy, Menke’s syndrome, Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne’s syndrome.",

Obviously the word pseudomeningitis, or false meningitis, can not be applied, as there can be no such thing as a false inflammation. The term \"meningeal irritation\" is defective, inaccurate, and anyway, can be applied only to a limited class of cases. The name meningism has been applied by the French neurologists to several morbid conditions associated with a meningitic syndrome. None of these writers treat the subject from an otologic viewpoint. Dupré writes: In the course of some infections or intoxications, or certain morbid states less well defined (dentition, helminthiasis, etc.), of which the indirect influence is called reflex, there may appear, most often in young and hysteric subjects, a syndrome more or less closely simulating the picture of meningitis.

      "abstract": "Aim: People with mental illness have more somatic comorbidities and are frequently mistreated. Misdiagnosis occurs for a variety of reasons, including stigma, poor communication, lack of knowledge of psychiatric pathology, and a tendency to attribute physical symptoms to a mental disorder. Case report: The factors listed above, as well as the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the misdiagnosis in the case discussed in this paper. The patient was a middle-aged man diagnosed with an ICD-10 diagnosis of a chronic mental disorder in the F2 category and multiple somatic comorbidities in whom amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis was undiagnosed and somatic symptoms were attributed to antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism. The mechanism of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms will be described, together with the factors that caused our patient to be misdiagnosed. Conclusion: Psychiatric patients are often specific in their communication and behaviour, therefore interaction must be adapted, with a focus on destigmatizing and educating health workers.",

It is suggested that all the asymmetric types of diabetic neuropathy, including the cranial-nerve palsies, mononeuropathies and mononeuropathy multiplex, are caused by infarcts within nerve. Diabetic amyotrophy is a proximal mononeuropathy multiplex and should not be separated from the other asymmetric neuropathies. Because these asymmetrical neuropathic syndromes do not seem to be unique to diabetes and the role of diabetes in their pathogenesis is still uncertain, the term ischeic mononeuropathy or mononeuropathy multiplex associated with diabetes mellitus is recommended.",

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies has greatly reduced the frequency of these complications in patients with access to these treatments. However, newer complications are now increasingly recognized such as neurological immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, a compartmentalization syndrome (cerebrospinal fluid escape).

The last condition is characterised by frank hypothyroidism accompanied by psychosis, and may respond completely to thyroxine.1 More recently described is a syndrome of subacute encephalopathy, associated with high titres of thyroid autoantibodies, raised CSF protein, EEG abnormalities, and perfusion deficits in the presence of normal structural neuroimaging.2-4 In most cases, the encephalopathy occurs without any gross change in circulating concentrations of thyroid hormones, suggesting that an inflammatory process is responsible for the cerebral dysfunction. In the absence of pathological data, the evidence for a specific pathogenetic mechanism is largely circumstantial: a small vessel vasculitis and immune complex deposition have both been suggested.3 4 \n\nAlthough none of the published cases of Hashimoto's encephalopathy has described psychosis as a primary feature, it is possible that “myxoedematous madness”, a condition first described in detail by Asher in 19491 lies in a range of encephalopathic phenomena mediated by autoimmune mechanisms. This suggestion would certainly be consistent with the range of clinical presentations of other autoimmune cerebral vasculitides.5 As autoimmune thyroiditis is the commonest cause of thyroid failure in this country,6 it is likely to have been present in at …",

Conversely, having a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, is associated with many factors that place one at greater risk for contracting and transmitting HIV. And, in both cases of serious mental illness and HIV/AIDS, each disorder creates many new challenges in the management of the other disorder. This chapter addresses these challenges, which center around being able to participate actively and adhere to medication regimens needed to manage both medical and psychiatric conditions. Fortunately, specialized models of care like comprehensive, integrated clinics and nurse care managers are ways to provide effective, satisfying, and cost-effective care to this most vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "A wide variety of symptoms have been reported since the start of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. One of those manifestations is dysautonomia, which is autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction resulting in either over-responsive or under-responsive sympathetic or parasympathetic components of the ANS. Previously, acute dysautonomia has been linked to viral infections such as mumps, herpes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Coxsackie viruses.1Carod-Artal FJ. Infectious diseases causing autonomic dysfunction.Clin Auton Res. 2018; 28: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar Acute autonomic dysfunction or acute dysautonomia can manifest with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including headache, somnolence, labile blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, impotence, bladder dysfunction, and bowel functions alterations.2Eshak N Abdelnabi M Ball S et al.Dysautonomia: an overlooked neurological manifestation in a critically ill COVID-19 patient.Am J Med Sci. 2020; 360: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar In response to the previously published journal article \"Dysautonomia: An Overlooked Neurological Manifestation in a Critically ill COVID-19 patient\" by Eshak et al,2Eshak N Abdelnabi M Ball S et al.Dysautonomia: an overlooked neurological manifestation in a critically ill COVID-19 patient.Am J Med Sci. 2020; 360: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar which described dysautonomia in a critically ill patient, we report a COVID-19 case that presented initially with acute dysautonomia manifested by recurrent acute attacks of hypertension and tachycardia in the absence of respiratory symptoms in a previously healthy adult female. A-58-year-old female patient with no previous medical history presented complaining of recurrent unexplained acute attacks of hypertension palpitations at rest, severe headache, and somnolence a few days after attending a social gathering; however, she denied any respiratory complaints or fever. Her clinical examination was unremarkable except for recurrent episodes of hypertension with blood pressure (BP) reaching 180/110 mmHg and heart rate (HR) of 130 beats/minute at rest, associated with severe headache and somnolence; nevertheless, no episodes of postural hypotension or postural tachycardia. A full laboratory and diagnostic imaging workup including complete blood count, full chemistry panel, urinary metanephrines, and computed tomography (CT) of the brain, chest and abdomen was done revealing no abnormality apart from mildly increased C-reactive protein (CRP). She tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Her condition was thought to be explained by viral infection-induced acute sympathetic dysfunction. She was managed conservatively at home with continuous BP monitoring using an ambulatory BP monitor that recorded episodes of hypertension with BP reaching 170/100 mmHg. She was commenced on short-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for hypertensive episodes and instructed to maintain a euvolemic state. Two weeks later, her BP was maintained, ranging from 110/80 mmHg to 130/90 mmHg with HR ranging from 75 to 85 beats/minute at rest, without receiving any antihypertensive medications. After that she was followed-up at 2-week intervals for 3 months, at which her BP was maintained at 110/80 mmHg with a resting HR of 70 beats/minute without treatment. Several previous reports highlighted the potential neurotropism of COVID-19 with a high binding affinity to medullary structures, due to their increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expression.3Montalvan V Lee J Bueso T et al.Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections: a systematic review.Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 2020; 194105921Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar COVID-19 associated neurological symptoms are ranging from headache, anosmia, and dysgeusia to neuropathy, encephalitis, cerebrovascular stroke, Guillan-Barrè Syndrome (GBS) and demyelination.3Montalvan V Lee J Bueso T et al.Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections: a systematic review.Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 2020; 194105921Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar Eshak et al,2Eshak N Abdelnabi M Ball S et al.Dysautonomia: an overlooked neurological manifestation in a critically ill COVID-19 patient.Am J Med Sci. 2020; 360: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar was the first to describe a case of acute dysautonomia causing hemodynamic instability manifested by fluctuating BP through the day, especially with postural changes, in a critically ill old age male with multiple co-morbidities admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 severe pneumonia, suggesting that hemodynamic instability may be explained by afferent baroreflex failure secondary to SARS-COV-2 infection and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) invasion resulting in highly labile BP with hypertensive crises alternating with hypotensive episodes; orthostatic hypotension was occasionally present. Eshak et al,2Eshak N Abdelnabi M Ball S et al.Dysautonomia: an overlooked neurological manifestation in a critically ill COVID-19 patient.Am J Med Sci. 2020; 360: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar recommended to maintain a euvolemic state and to avoid excessive fluid resuscitation during hypotensive episodes with gradual titration of vasopressors if needed to avoid overshooting blood pressures and short-acting anti-hypertensive medications use in hypertensive crisis. On the contrary, our case presented only with acute dysautonomia in the form of sympathetic overactivity with recurrent attacks of elevated BP, resting tachycardia. It was neither related to posture nor associated with postural hypotension. The autonomic dysfunction improved after resolution of the acute phase of infection. Autonomic impairment can even persist months after the acute infection. Miglis et al,4Miglis MG Prieto T Shaik R et al.A case report of postural tachycardia syndrome after COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar reported postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) as a complication of COVID-19 infection in a young healthy female. Although early in the acute phase of infection she reported tachycardia as well as COVID-19 related respiratory symptoms, these symptoms resolved within 3 weeks while symptoms of autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia persisted and augmented over the next few months after the resolution of COVID-19 infection. Her autonomic tests revealed hyperadrenergic POTS, but her serum norepinephrine was not only normal but even lower than levels typically reported in POTS. Several mechanisms were proposed to explain the pathophysiology of post-COVID-POTS. First, SARS-CoV-2 might affect extra-cardiac post-ganglionic SNS neurons resulting in an increase in cardiac SNS outflow, as in neuropathic POTS. Also, it might invade the brainstem and alter medullary centers functions causing an increased central sympathetic discharge. Another possible mechanism may be autoimmune antibody production triggered by a viral infection. Finally, POTS deconditioning can be part of a vicious cycle involving low stroke volume, high SNS or SAS outflows, exercise intolerance, and fatigue.5Goldstein DS. The possible association between COVID-19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.Heart Rhythm. 2021; 18: 508-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar Our case highlights that even mild cases of COVID-19 can present with acute dysautonomia even in immunocompetent patients. Further close follow-up is required to detect cases of persistent autonomic dysfunction after the resolution of COVID-19 infection. All the authors declare no conflict of interest.",

Methods: A systematic review of the literature found in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and SCIELO was performed to search for relevant references on Chagas' disease and neurological manifestations. Results: The involvement of the nervous system in Chagas' disease is well established. The acute phase is described as a meningoencephalitis that more frequently affects children under 2 years old and is almost always fatal in those with coexistent myocarditis and cardiac insufficiency. In the chronic phase, it presents as neuritis that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment, and is reported in up to 10% of the patients. Isolated cases of central nervous system involvement can also include dementia, confusion, chronic encephalopathy and sensitive and motor deficits. Concurrent immunosuppression, such as that related to human immunodeficiency virus and organ transplantation, can result in the reactivation of the Trypanosoma cruzi infection. In these patients meningoencephalitis and brain abscesses may occur with a high mortality rate despite specific treatment. Discussion: Although neurological involvement is infrequent, it has a high mortality and morbidity rate when is not well diagnosed and treated on time.",

These patients developed respiratory failure which could not be explained by any cardiac or pulmonary pathology. The first case had pure motor involvement and probable CIDP, and the second case had severe sensorial dysfunction and an ataxic picture in addition to motor symptoms. His clinical picture was compatible with distal acquired demyelinating sensory neuropathy without M protein. Electrophysiologic investigations of both patients disclosed impaired phrenic nerve conduction and neurogenic motor unit changes in the diaphragm. Both patients showed a moderate response to immunotherapy. Distal acquired demyelinating sensory and pure motor variant of CIDP can be a cause of respiratory dysfunction. Different clinical patterns of CIDP should be evaluated for phrenic nerve involvement.",

Chronic encephalopathies may be non-progressive, occurring, for example, as a consequence of brain trauma or cerebral hypoxia, or progressive, arising as a result of an intrinsic, extrinsic or metabolic cerebral disorder. The primary focus of this article is the dementia syndromes that result from progressive degenerative disease. However, vascular disease will also briefly be addressed, because vascular dementia is relatively common and is an important cause of dementia. The traditional view of dementia as a global loss of intellect is inaccurate. Cerebral diseases do not affect the brain uniformly, but preferentially affect certain brain regions and spare others. Moreover, psychological processes themselves are regionally organized in specific brain regions. Different cerebral diseases therefore are associated with distinctive and characteristic neuropsychological syndromes, whose identification can",

      "abstract": "Primary mitochondrial diseases are caused by heritable or spontaneous mutations in nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA. Such pathological mutations are relatively common in humans and may lead to neurological and neuromuscular complication that could compromise normal sleep behavior. To gain insight into the potential impact of primary mitochondrial disease and sleep pathology, we reviewed the relevant English language literature in which abnormal sleep was reported in association with a mitochondrial disease.We examined publication reported in Web of Science and PubMed from February 1976 through January 2014, and identified 54 patients with a proven or suspected primary mitochondrial disorder who were evaluated for sleep disturbances.Both nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA mutations were associated with abnormal sleep patterns. Most subjects who underwent polysomnography had central sleep apnea, and only 5 patients had obstructive sleep apnea. Twenty-four patients showed decreased ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia and/ or hyperapnea that was not considered due to weakness of the intrinsic muscles of respiration.Sleep pathology may be an underreported complication of primary mitochondrial diseases. The probable underlying mechanism is cellular energy failure causing both central neurological and peripheral neuromuscular degenerative changes that commonly present as central sleep apnea and poor ventilatory response to hyperapnea. Increased recognition of the genetics and clinical manifestations of mitochondrial diseases by sleep researchers and clinicians is important in the evaluation and treatment of all patients with sleep disturbances. Prospective population-based studies are required to determine the true prevalence of mitochondrial energy failure in subjects with sleep disorders, and conversely, of individuals with primary mitochondrial diseases and sleep pathology.",

Recently, we investigated a 16-year-old Korean boy with normal intelligence. He had preserved pain sensation but was suspected of having hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV because of the recurrent bone fractures and painless joint destruction in the absence of any predisposing medical conditions. Genetic analysis of the NTRK1 gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations including c.851-33T&gt;A and c.2303C&gt;T (p.Pro768Leu) in the NTRK1 gene. The p.Pro768Leu mutation has been identified in 2 Japanese patients with a mild phenotype. Therefore, although it is rare, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV should be considered in patients with recurrent bone fractures and painless joint destruction who do not have any predisposing conditions even when they do not have typical clinical features such as mental retardation or pain insensitivity.",

Examination limitations, complex comorbidities, and technical difficulties associated with electrodiagnostic testing in an ICU setting also create unique challenges during evaluation of patients with possible neuromuscular disorders. Respiratory failure may occur as an initial sign of an underlying neuromuscular disorder, as a chronic respiratory insufficiency, or as an inability to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory function is often closely related to dysphagia, which may also lead to aspiration and sudden worsening of respiratory function. In addition to weakness, progressive cardiomyopathy associated with myopathies can precipitate cardiac failure and arrhythmias and even necessitate heart transplantation.

      "abstract": "Abstract Impaired vigilance is a core cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and may serve as an endophenotype (i.e., mark genetic liability). We used a continuous performance task with perceptually degraded stimuli in schizophrenia patients ( N=48) , bipolar disorder patients ( N=26) , and first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients ( N =55) and bipolar disorder patients ( N =28) and healthy controls ( N =68) to clarify whether previously reported vigilance deficits and abnormal neural functions were indicative of genetic liability for schizophrenia as opposed to a generalized liability for severe psychopathology. We also examined variation in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase gene to evaluate whether brain responses were related to genetic variation associated with higher-order cognition. Relatives of schizophrenia patients had an increased rate of misidentification of nontarget stimuli as targets when they were perceptually similar, possibly reflecting difficulties with contour perception. Larger early visual responses (i.e., N1) were associated with better task performance, while reduced N2 augmentation to target stimuli was specific to schizophrenia patients. Both schizophrenia patients and relatives of schizophrenia patients displayed reduced late cognitive responses (P3b) that predicted worse performance. Bipolar patients and their relatives exhibited performance deficits and some aberrant neural responses that were milder and dependent on sex. Variation in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase gene was differentially associated with P3b in schizophrenia and bipolar groups. Poor vigilance in schizophrenia is specifically predicted by a failure to enhance early visual responses, weak augmentation of mid-latency brain responses to targets, and limited engagement of late cognitive responses that may be tied to genetic variation associated with prefrontal dopaminergic availability.",

Sao doencas caracterizadas por um ataque autoimune a mielina causando desmielinizacao do nervo afetado. Embora haja preservacao do axonio, esta desmielinizacao geralmente resulta na diminuicao da conducao pelo nervo. Sendo caracterizada por exacerbacoes e remissoes (KURTZKE, BEEBE E DAGLER, 1972). As causas da EM sao desconhecidas, mas supoe-se que seja associada a infeccao viral ou outro antigeno desconhecido que desencadeie o processo autoimune.Segundo Gustavo Neto et al., 2002, os disturbios da marcha, a fraqueza, o enrijecimento dos membros inferiores e o comprometimento do equilibrio dinâmico constituem os principais sinais e sintomas de apresentacao da doenca. As alteracoes sensoriais nem sempre acompanham o quadro motor, ha relato de disestesias e parestesias (dormencia, formigamentos) ao longo dos membros inferiores e predominantemente distais assim como dor na regiao lombar e um dos sintomas comuns e ainda  perda da visao, visao dupla, fraqueza, falta de equilibrio,  dor, problemas no controle da bexiga e intestinos, fadiga, mudancas emocionais e comprometimento intelectual (NOGUEIRA e COLS, 2009). Neste estudo objetivou avaliar a funcao sexual de mulheres com diagnostico definido de esclerose multipla e de Mielopatia associada ao HTLV1M(HAM/TSP), na forma recidivante-remitente e com a doenca estabilizada por pelo menos quatro meses, com idade acima de 20 anos, capacidade cognitiva de responder os questionarios de avaliacao, apresentando sintomas de disfuncoes urinarias por no minimo seis meses. Utilizando o (FSFI) Female Sexual Function Index. A amostra utilizada foram no total de 27 mulheres sendo 6 mulheres com esclerose multipla, 8 mulheres com HTLV1 e 13 mulheres do grupo controle (saudaveis).E um desafio medir o grau de satisfacao sexual de mulheres, pois diversas sao as variaveis que interagem entre si biologicas, psicologicas, fisiologicas, padroes culturais e que podem influenciar o grau de satisfacao final  afirma HENTSCHEL, et al. 2007.As mulheres neste estudo eram pacientes portadoras de esclerose multipla e Mielopatia Associada ao HLTV-I (HAM/TSP), devido essa particularidade, entende-se que podem originar alteracoes na funcao sexual devido o comprometimento da doenca com diminuicao na qualidade de vida. O FSFI e um instrumento relativamente novo, que tem sido utilizado com sucesso para avaliar a funcao sexual em diferentes grupos.Resultados: As analises estatisticas foram realizadas por meio do programa Graphpad Prism 6.0 e os resultados expressos pela diferenca entre as medias. Na avaliacao do escore total da funcao sexual nas pacientes com Esclerose multipla, infectadas com o virus HTLV-I e Doadoras saudaveis apresentando diferenca estatistica. Quando avaliado os dominios de forma separada entre os grupos foi possivel observar  diferenca entre os grupos de HTLV1 e as Doadoras Saudaveis. Diante das mulheres estudadas percebe-se a necessidade de compreender de outros estudos neste sentido, para poder contribuir com as discussoes no campo da sexualidade feminina que se mostra tao importante para qualidade de vida.",

      "abstract": "Secondary demyelinating diseases comprise a wide spectrum group of pathological conditions and may either be attributed to a disorder primarily affecting the neurons or axons, followed by demyelination, or to an underlying condition leading to secondary damage of the myelin sheath. In the elderly, primary demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis, are relatively uncommon. However, secondary causes of CNS demyelination may often occur and in this case, extensive diagnostic workup is usually needed. Infectious, postinfectious, or postvaccinal demyelination may be observed, attributed to age-related alterations of the immune system in this population. Osmotic disturbances and nutritional deficiencies, more commonly observed in the elderly, may lead to conditions such as pontine/extrapontine myelinolysis, Wernicke encephalopathy, and demyelination of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The prevalence of malignancies is higher in the elderly, sometimes leading to radiation-induced, immunotherapy-related, or paraneoplastic CNS demyelination. This review intends to aid clinical neurologists in broadening their diagnostic approach to secondary CNS demyelinating diseases in the elderly. Common clinical conditions leading to secondary demyelination and their clinical manifestations are summarized here, while the current knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is additionally presented.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

      "title": "P3‐174: Mild cognitive impairment: A new hope",
      "abstract": "Various studies have suggested that Alzeimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic process that begins well before clinical expression of dementia. Moreover, works showed that weak cognitive performances can precede by a few years the diagnosis of AD. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a state of abnormal cognitive functioning that is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The concept of MCI nominates old persons afflicted with light cognitive disorders which could present certain signs of AD several years before this one is not diagnosed. MCI does not significantly impact basic daily activities and is not accompanied by declines in overall cognitive function. People with MCI are three to four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without such impairment. Amnestic MCI (significantly affects memory) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, while nonamnestic MCI may progress to other types of syndromes (such as frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia or dementia with Lewy bodies). But some people with MCI don't go on to develop any type of dementia. Some remain stable, while others even revert to normal.The conversion rate from MCI to AD is 12% per year. After a brief presentation of the concept of MCI, this communication will emphasize on different subjects like cognitive area. This deficits will be link with neuroimmaging that demonstrate atrophic hippocampal formations, atrophic enthorinal cortices, greater total brain atrophy, enlarge ventricles. We demonstrated deficits in : – memory: episodic memory, visuopsatial and spatial short terme memory -executive function: flexibility and planification -attention : focus attention, visual search, ability to desengaged attention and to use visual cue to produce an alerting effect. MCI is a concept based on criteria of Petersen. This criteria help us to know if MCI is a transition state between cognitive decline on normal aging and clinical presentation of dementia. More over, this cognitive deficits help us to make the link between cognitive area and activity of daily living. MCI is a new hope for our generation and the prevention of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Dementia or Major Neurocognitive disorder is the second most burdensome chronic condition in which 11.9 percent live with disability and 1.1 percent lost their lives, and their numbers will be doubling every 20 years to 65.7 million by 2030, and 115.4 million by 2050. Dementia due to vascular diseases is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and 28 to 36 million people worldwide with dementia are undiagnosed1. Vascular Dementia is characterized by distinct aspects of impaired consciousness and such an impairment is indexed by declined performances at controlled cognitive tasks. It is related to reduced brain metabolic activity in a network of frontal, posterior associative, and limbic regions due to the occurrence of multiple mini/major strokes or other conditions that affect blood vessels and nerve fibres deep inside the brain. Diagnosis of Vascular dementia in its preliminary stages is a very complex task as it requires screening, Neuro-cognitive testing, and brain imaging evidence usually CT Scan or MRI. Sometimes cause of mild impairment cannot be diagnosed by brain Imaging. EEG based diagnostic approaches are promising tool in case of differentiating diverse types of dementia. Portable EEG with its high temporal resolution property is an economical solution for the many undiagnosed people with dementia in the low and middle income countries. This paper reviews EEG analysis approaches to diagnose vascular mild impairment and dementia as a future diagnostic tool in the healthcare sector.",

IDD is not a static condition but, rather, a dynamic one, which has multiple etiologies that must be considered in treatment planning. It is not a disease or an illness in itself but, rather, has heterogeneous etiologies. In IDD, thinking is not characteristically disordered, and perception is not distorted unless there is a concurrent mental disorder. This chapter reviews the history, diagnosis, classification, epidemiology, etiology, developmental issues, genetics, psychiatric assessment, psychopathology, and treatment of intellectual developmental disorders. Public law and the right to education and legal competency are also discussed.",

It is important to understand the diagnostic criteria for patients with HIV-related disorders to distinguish CNS disturbances caused by infections from those psychiatric problems exacerbated by the social consequences of the syndrome. Although treatment is difficult in immunocompromised patients and treatments may cause serious side effects, many of the CNS symptoms of AIDS patients can be treated in the same way as other diseases of the CNS. Psychostimulants are the most promising therapeutic agents for AIDS patients. In the treatment of psychotic episodes, high-potency neuroleptics at low dosages have been used successfully.

They could be divided into direct (viral), secondary (somatogenic) and post(para)infectious (autoimmune) variants according to the pathogenetic mechanisms of their development. The most common type is a secondary impairment of the nervous system presented with encephalopathy of hypoxic, infectious/toxic or dysmetabolic origin. Its major mechanism is related to the brain edema while clinical presentations include non-specific symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and consciousness impairments. Only single reports exist on coronavirus meningoencephalitides. Postinfectious complications of COVID-19 mostly presented with different forms of Gulliane-Barre syndrome. Stroke is registered in 2.5-5% of COVID-19 cases. Their development is associated with hypercoagulation and endothelial dysfunction. Strokes more often develop in elderly with established vascular risk factors and severe COVID-1 but they might also be observed in people younger than 50 years of age and in those with relatively mild forms of the disease. More research is needed in this area.Симптомы поражения нервной системы наблюдаются у 6—36% пациентов с COVID-19. По патогенетическим механизмам выделяют непосредственное (вирусное), вторичное (соматогенное) и пост(пара)инфекционное (аутоиммунное) поражение нервной системы. Наиболее частый вариант — вторичное поражение нервной системы, представленное энцефалопатией гипоксического, инфекционно-токсического или дисметаболического генеза. В его основе лежит отек головного мозга, а основные симптомы представлены общемозговой симптоматикой (головная боль, несистемное головокружение, спутанность сознания). Коронавирусные менингоэнцефалиты представлены единичными наблюдениями. Постинфекционные неврологические осложнения COVID-19 чаще проявляются различными формами синдрома Гийена—Барре. Острые нарушения мозгового кровообращения (ОНМК) наблюдаются в 2,5—5% случаев COVID-19. Их развитие связано с синдромом гиперкоагуляции и эндотелиальной дисфункцией. Чаще ОНМК развивается у пожилых пациентов с сосудистыми факторами риска и тяжелым течением COVID-19. Однако инсульты могут наблюдаться и у лиц младше 50 лет с относительно легкими формами болезни.

      "title": "Diphenhydramine-induced delirium on top of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder",
      "abstract": "Introduction HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder has been less frequent in recent years due to the availability of anti-retrovials. However, in the Philippines, persons with HIV are diagnosed late resulting to cases of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. With higher incidence of depression and anxiety in this population, difficulty sleeping becomes a prominent symptom and diphenhydramine is a common non-prescription nighttime sleep aid being given. Objectives To present a case of diphenhydramine-induced delirium after a patient with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Methods This a case report. Results Mr. JR., a 38-year-old person living with HIV and no past psychiatric history, presents with acute onset altered mental status, suicidal attempt, and jerking movements of the neck and extremities. He has been having bouts of diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and forgetfulness for a year before he was diagnosed with HIV-AIDS with CD4 count of 59 cells/mm3. At this time, he already had blurring of vision, poor sleep, weakness, poor concentration, and increasing severity of forgetfulness. He also started to have depressed mood and anhedonia but no suicidal ideations. He was eventually started on antiretroviral (ARVs) which are lamivudine, tenofovir, dolutegravir and antibiotics targeting opportunistic bacteria – Isoniazid, Moxifloxacin and Clindamycin. A few days after, he started to have jerking movements of the neck and extremities contributing further to poor sleep. Upon consult with a local clinic to address his sleep, he was prescribed with Diphenhydramine and after taking 50mg dose that evening, he started to have disorientation, paranoia, command auditory hallucinations resulting to a suicidal attempt, on top of the jerking movements, which prompted consult to the emergency room and subsequent admission. Initially assessed as central nervous system infection and focal seizure, CSF fluids studies and EEG were done showing normal findings. Started on Sodium Valproate + Valproic acid 500mg IV twice daily and Olanzapine 2.5mg twice a day, on top of his previously mentioned ARVs and antibiotics, the disorientation, auditory hallucinations, and myoclonic jerks mood resolved after five days. Five months on ARVs, he has no recurrence of myoclonic jerks, disorientation or psychosis, with memory and concentration improved, euthymic mood, and was able to resume work as an engineer. Conclusions Diphenhydramine is a common nighttime sleep aid. Due to its anticholinergic effect, cases of delirium were reported for doses 300mg to 1,000mg per day. For Mr. JR, the mere 50mg dose of diphenhydramine caused disorientation and psychosis as his co-occurring HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder made his brain “delirium-ready”. Diphenhydramine is a relatively safe drug however not getting a thorough medical history may inadvertently cause harm to patients who are medically ill and frail.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by distinctive facial features (widely spaced eyes, broad eyebrows with a medial flare, low-hanging columella, prominent or pointed chin, open-mouth expression, and uplifted earlobes with a central depression), congenital heart defects with predilection for abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries and/or valves, Hirschsprung disease or chronic constipation, genitourinary anomalies (particularly hypospadias in males), and hypogenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with Angelman syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay / intellectual disability and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by the appropriate specialist for dental anomalies, seizures, ocular abnormalities, congenital heart defects, chronic constipation, Hirschsprung disease, genitourinary abnormalities, and pectus anomalies of the chest and/or foot/ankle anomalies; educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy. Surveillance: Annual eye examination in childhood to monitor for strabismus and refractive errors; monitoring for otitis media; regular developmental assessments to plan/refine educational interventions; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist. Genetic counseling MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement.",

Manifestations of myelinolysis usually evolve several days after correction of hyponatremia. Typical features are disorders of upper motor neurons, spastic quadriparesis and pseudobulbar palsy, and mental disorders ranging from mild confusion to coma. Death may occur. The motor and localizing signs of myelinolysis differ from the generalized encephalopathy that is caused by untreated hyponatremia. Experiments have duplicated the clinical and pathologic features of myelinolysis by rapidly reversing hyponatremia in animals.Myelinolysis is more likely to occur after the treatment of chronic rather than acute hyponatremia and is more likely to occur with a rapid rate of correction. The exact pathogenesis of myelinolysis has not been determined. Optimal management of hyponatremic patients involves weighing the risk for illness and death from untreated hyponatremia against the risk for myelinolysis due to correction of hyponatremia.Experiments in animals and clinical experience suggest that correction of chronic hyponatremia should be kept at a rate less than 10 mmol/L in any 24-hour period.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Objective:</h3> To describe a case of MOG associated Transverse Myelitis after COVID-19 infection in a young adult. <h3>Background:</h3> Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by attacks of immune-mediated demyelination predominantly targeting the optic nerves, brain, and spinal cord. In some cases of MOG associated Acute Transverse Myelitis (ATM), there is an antecedent history of infection or vaccination. <h3>Design/Methods:</h3> We report the case of a patient with different neurological manifestations of CNS demyelination presenting within six weeks of moderate COVID-19 illness. <h3>Results:</h3> A 28-year-old man with hypertension presented with a three-week history of rapidly progressive paraparesis, sensory disturbances, saddle anesthesia, constipation and urinary retention, starting six weeks after moderate COVID-19 illness. MRI revealed non-enhancing T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, inferior aspect of medulla, and a long segment, non-enhancing T2 signal intensity involving the cervical and thoracic spinal cord. Laboratory testing was remarkable for normal CSF analysis, positive serum COVID-19 IGG/IGM antibodies, and MOG antibodies titer at &gt;1:160. Multiple courses of systemic glucocorticoids provided mild to moderate improvement, so subsequent plasma exchange therapy was started with significant resolution of patient’s symptoms. Follow-up MRIs at 2 and 8 months showed interval resolution of cervical spinal cord edema and near-complete resolution of focal hyperintense T2/STIR cord lesions. <h3>Conclusions:</h3> MOGAD is typically steroid-responsive with favorable long-term recovery. Although the present case involved a rare condition of MOGAD associated ATM after COVID-19 infection, detailed studies of additional clinical cases are necessary to determine the causation and the risk of developing this condition. We hypothesized the possibility of an immune mediated reaction triggered by COVID-19, inducing demyelination and autoimmune encephalomyelitis mediated by MOG-antibodies. <b>Disclosure:</b> Dr. Graciano has nothing to disclose.

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to frank psychosis, have been associated with certain parasitic infections. The parasite may cause damage to the central nervous system in several ways: as a space-occupying lesion (neuro-cysticercosis), alteration of neurotransmitters (toxoplasmosis), generation of the inflammatory response (trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis), hypovolemic neuronal injury (cerebral malaria), or a combination of these. Certain drugs like quinacrine (mepacrine), mefloquine, quinolone, and interferon alpha which are used to treat these parasitic infections can further cause neuropsychiatric adverse effects. This review summarizes the major parasitic infections that are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and the pathogenesis involved in their processes. A high index of suspicion for parasitic diseases, especially in endemic areas, should be kept in patients presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms. A multidimensional approach to identification of the offending parasite using serological, radiological, and molecular tests is required not only to ensure proper and prompt treatment of the primary parasitic infection but also to improve the prognosis of patients by complete resolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

Acute NB occurs as acute meningoencephalitis with focal lesions, presenting with high-intensity areas on T2-weighted images or flat images on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Chronic progressive NB is characterized by intractable, slowly progressive dementia and ataxia with progressive brain stem atrophy on MRI. The most important feature of chronic progressive NB is persistent elevation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 levels. The progression rate of the brain stem atrophy has been shown to be closely correlated with integrated CSF IL-6. For the correct diagnosis of acute or chronic progressive NB, it is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of Behcet's disease. Regarding treatment, all of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine are ineffective to treat chronic progressive NB. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is effective in decreasing CSF IL-6 levels without promoting the progression of neuropsychological manifestations. Infliximab has a beneficial effect in patients with inadequate response to MTX. Recently, clinical guidelines were established for the management of acute NB and chronic progressive NB, which is helpful for routine clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is one of the most debilitating complications to cirrhosis (1). It has a considerable impact on patients as well as their caregivers and the health care system. The condition is defined as a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency or portal systemic shunting. The symptoms, which are potentially reversible, vary from subclinical to deep coma. Symptomatic, also known as overt HE is a marker of decompensated cirrhosis. Overt HE may be precipitated by an event such as infection or bleeding, but often, no precipitating factor is identified. Overt HE is generally graded based on the severity of the symptoms according to the four-point West Haven Scale (2). The highest (worst) grade (3 to 4) are characterised by impaired consciousness. Grade 3 HE is diagnosed in patients with somnolence/semi-stupor, who remain responsive to stimuli; are confused, show gross disorientation or bizarre behaviour. Grade 4 is defined as coma (not responsive to stimuli). According to the time course, HE is defined as episodic, recurrent or persistent. In patients with cirrhosis, the risk of developing HE is closely related to the severity of the underlying liver disease (3).",

A variety of cognitive deficits may persist after the acute stage, and they are often the sole cause of disability. Recent literature demonstrates the heterogeneity of both amnestic disorders and the outcome following encephalitis. Herpes simplex virus is the most commonly recognised single aetiology of sporadic encephalitis and it may be the cause of the most severe symptoms. Antiviral medication, however, seems to have improved the cognitive outcome when compared to the historical, untreated cases. The cognitive sequelae following herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) are best known and most commonly described, e.g., in textbooks, but they do not represent the typical symptomatology of encephalitis in general. Much less is unfortunately known about other types of encephalitis, those that account perhaps up to 80% of all cases, where both mild and severe defects have been observed.

      "title": "AYURVEDIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY",
      "abstract": "Introduction: One of the most common consequences of diabetes is diabetic neuropathy, which is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Neuropathy affects approximately 50% of individuals with diabetes. Diabetes mellitus shares similarities with Madhumeha in terms of etiopathogenesis and symptomatology. In Avaranjanya Madhumeha vitiated Pitta, Meda and Kapha lead to the Avarana of Vata, exacerbating the condition and hinder-ing the formation of essential Dhatus, resulting in complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathies are believed to arise from diabetic microvascular injury affecting the small blood vessels that sup-ply nerves, in addition to macrovascular conditions that may culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Despite signifi-cant advancements in insulin and hypoglycemic medications that have benefited people with diabetes, these pa-tients still lack adequate treatment for their neuropathic complications. Diminished perception of vibration and impairment of other modalities of sensation are the most typical indications of diabetic sensory polyneuropathy. Materials and Method: A review of various classical textbooks, journals and modern literature supporting the understanding of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was conducted. Discussion: Symptoms of diabetic pe-ripheral neuropathy can be identified by characteristics such as Karapadadaha (burning sensation), Cumcuma-yana (tingling sensation) and Suptata (numbness) which are observed in Madhumeha at any stage during the dis-ease's Purvarupa (prodromal), Rupa (sign and symptom) or Upadrava (complication) stages. Conclusion: A review of diabetic peripheral neuropathy based on the etiopathology and symptoms of DPN in Ayurveda re-vealed its similarities with Madhumeha Purvarupa, Lakshana and Upadrava.",

Being the symptomatology unclear, the findings of magnetic resonance of the brain oriented versus an infectious disorder. The lumbar tap confirmed the presence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 virus and an antiviral therapy was administered, leading to resolution of the condition within the 3 weeks of hospitalization.HSV infections may mimic stroke and therefore should be included in the differential diagnosis of atypical acute nervous conditions. In neurological events of acute nature, especially in febrile patients whose brain imaging is suspicious or inconclusive, the eventuality of a herpetic encephalitis should be kept in mind.

In dit artikel bespreken we de onderzoeksliteratuur betreffende niet-farmacologische interventies bij MCI en dementie. Er is beperkt bewijs voor restauratieve interventies bij mensen met MCI, waarbij interventies gericht op fysieke activiteit het effectiefst zijn. Compensatoire interventies bij mensen met MCI richten zich bijvoorbeeld op cognitieve compensatiestrategieën, het verbeteren van de stemming, of beide. Compensatoire interventies bij MCI en interventies voor onbegrepen gedrag bij dementie laten geringe, maar positieve resultaten zien. Niet-farmacologische interventies bij dementie richten zich met name op onbegrepen gedrag bij dementie. Deze interventies sluiten tevens goed aan bij het doel van de Zorgstandaard Dementie om adequaat om te gaan met de cognitieve, sociale, gedragsmatige en emotionele gevolgen van MCI en dementie.",

      "title": "Teràpia gènica per neuropatia diabètica mitjançant vectors adeno-associats codificant pel factor de creixement similar a la insulina i (IGF-I)",
      "abstract": "La neuropatia diabetica es una de les complicacions mes frequents de la Diabetis Mellitus. Es una patologia del sistema nervios periferic que causa una incapacitat progressiva important de la funcio motora i sensorial en els individus que la pateixen. L'afectacio nerviosa es distingeix per una degeneracio progressiva de les fibres nervioses i un retard en el proces de regeneracio de les fibres danyades. Els simptomes de la neuropatia inclouen perdua de sensibilitat, rigidesa, coissor i en ocasions dolor als peus i mans. La terapia intensiva amb insulina redueix la incidencia de les complicacions de la diabetis pero els pacients diabetics continuen desenvolupant neuropatia diabetica a llarg plac. Els tractaments actuals per la neuropatia diabetica no son efectius i estan orientats principalment a pal·liar el dolor neuropatic. La terapia genica podria ser un tractament alternatiu per aquesta patologia. Els vectors Adeno-associats son uns dels vectors de terapia genica interessants per assajos clinics en humans, ja que son capacos de dirigir l'expressio del transgen a llarg plac, mantenint-se de forma episomal a la cel·lula hoste. A mes no presenten toxicitat associada al virus silvestre, el que augmenta la bioseguretat d'aquests vectors i es poden produir a titols alts. La recent descripcio de nous serotips de vectors Adeno-associats, els quals entren a les cel·lules humanes mitjancant diferents receptors cel·lulars, ha obert la possibilitat de delimitar selectivament la infeccio de diferents tipus cel·lulars dins d'un mateix organ. Amb la finalitat de caracteritzar vectors com a eines de terapia genica eficients per neuropatia diabetica es van utilitzar els serotips AAV1 i AAVrh10 per infectar cultius organotipics de ganglis de l'arrel dorsal (DRG) de ratoli. Ambdos vectors van mostrar un tropisme preferencial per neurones sensorials petites, correlacionant despres amb el tipus de neurones transduides mes eficientment mitjancant injeccio intratecal in vivo en ratolins. L'estabilitat dels vectors AAV1 i AAVrh10 in vivo es va confirmar fins a setmana 10, duracio maxima de l'experiment. No obstant l'eficiencia d'AAVrh10 era molt superior a la d'AAV1 tant a neurones sensorials com motores, aconseguint un percentatge de transduccio al voltant del 50% en DRG i del 30% en motoneurones amb el serotip rh10. A mes a mes, s'ha demostrat que AAV1 es mes immunogenic que AAVrh10 quan s'injecten a liquid cefaloraquidi, doncs l'administracio d'AAV1 genera un titol molt mes elevat d'anticossos neutralitzants en sang contra aquest serotip. Com a assaig preclinic de terapia genica es van administrar els vectors AAV1 i AAVrh10 codificant per el factor de creixement similar a la insulina I (IGF-I) o codificant per la proteina GFP com a control, en el liquid cefaloraquidi d'un model muri per neuropatia diabetica, que combina diabetis induida amb estreptozotozina (STZ) junt amb lesio a nervi ciatic (crush). IGF-I es un factor de creixement que juga un paper important en la supervivencia i diferenciacio de neurones, oligodendrocits i cel·lules de Schwann i tambe en la formacio de la mielina. Aquest factor de creixement ha estat utilitzat com a tractament d'una gran varietat de patologies del sistema nervios, incloent neuropaties diverses, degut a la seva accio com a potent agent en la supervivencia i diferenciacio cel·lular. L'analisi molecular dels nervis periferics dels animals tractats amb AAV-IGF-I mostrava un augment de l'expressio del gen terapeutic IGF-I, que correlacionava amb l'activacio de la via de senyalitzacio d'aquest factor de creixement, aixi com dels gens implicats en la regeneracio (GAP43) o els gens relacionats amb la mielina (P0, PMP22, MAG, MBP), en comparacio amb els animals control. A diferencia d'AAV1, AAVrh10 mostrava expressio del transgen tambe en neurones motores de la medul·la espinal. La correlacio entre les dades bioquimiques obtingudes i els tests neurofisiologics realitzats en els animals injectats amb AAV-IGF-I, va permetre observar una millora de la velocitat de conduccio nerviosa sensorial en els animals tractats amb AAV1-IGF-I i una millora de la velocitat de conduccio nerviosa sensorial i motora en els animals transduits amb AAVrh10-IGF-I, respecte els animals diabetics control. Per tant, l'administracio intratecal dels vectors AAV1 i principalment AAVrh10 codificant per IGF-I ofereixen una visio prometedora pel tractament o prevencio de les neuropaties periferiques, en general, i de la neuropatia diabetica, en concret.",

      "title": "Reversible dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term reversible dementia is often a misnomer for other syndromes which globally impair cognitive function such as acute and subacute confusional state and subcortical dementia. Evidence from studies on the investigation of dementia and case reports of conditions traditionally held to cause reversible dementia (normal pressure hydrocephalus, vitamin B 12 deficiency, subdural haematoma) suggest that cortical dementia is not often a treatable syndrome. Acute or subacute confusional states and subcortical dementia are more typically associated with treatable or reversible causes of brain dysfunction. Diagnosis of these syndromes may identify those patients (especially those of advanced years) who should be extensively investigated.",

The CNS development is different in all stages of development and age of a child. Neurometabolic, genetically degenerative, and neuromuscular disorders, also congenital malformations of the nervous system, tumors, vascular, inflammatory, and traumatic damages of the nervous system as well as epilepsies, are typical neuropediatric disease groups. Often, not only the CNS but also other organ systems are also affected. A multidisciplinary treatment of the affected child is of most importance. An intensive exchange with other specialists, therapists, psychologists, electrophysiologists, radiologists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, etc., is therefore necessary. The challenge is to provide sufficient information to the other disciplines, which usually have no experience with these specific diseases, so that they can adequately assess their results. This is even more complicated with rare diseases.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The syndromes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild neurocognitive disorder (MiND), often prodromal to dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder), are characterized by acquired clinically significant changes in one or more cognitive domains despite preserved independence. Mild impairment has significant medicolegal consequences for an affected person and their care system. We review the more common etiologies of MiND and provide a systematic review of its medicolegal implications. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature on medicolegal aspects of MCI or MiND using comprehensive search terms and expanding our review to include sources cited by these reports. Results: Impairment of memory, executive function, social cognition, judgment, insight or abstraction can alter an individual’s abilities in a variety of areas that include decision making, informed consent, designation of a surrogate decision-maker such as a health care proxy, understanding and management of financial affairs, execution of a will, or safe driving. Conclusion: Even mild cognitive impairment can have significant behavioral consequences. Clinicians can assist care partners and persons with MCI or MiND by alerting them to the medicolegal concerns that often accompany cognitive decline. Early recognition and discussion can help a care system manage medicolegal risk more effectively and promote thoughtful advance planning.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Psychiatric symptoms set forth brain dysfunction at several levels. Behavioral disturbances, although frequently associated to primary psychiatric disorders, call for a previous discard of neurologic treatable causes. Case report We report the case of a 30-year-old gentleman, receiving outpatient psychological treatment and follow-up for a 3-month history of low mood, abulia, apathy, generalized malaise, weight loss and insomnia. Non-structured jealous delusions were also present. No neurological deficit was found. After CT of the brain, a space occupying lesion, suggestive of glioblastoma multiforme, was found. Further studies, including biopsy and a MR, led to the diagnosis of central nervous system Chagas, related to a previously unknown HIV infection in AIDS status, and conditioning a secondary central hipothyroidism. Careful treatment of the etiological factors, along with symptomatic relieve with low dose paliperidone, led to the resolution of the symptoms. Discussion The majority of patients suffering from neurologic diseases develop psychiatric symptoms over the course of their illness, with or without the presence of classical disturbances, such as weakness, sensory loss or seizures. Modern psychiatry uses a complex disease model, therefore necessarily integrating anatomy, biochemistry and function during every diagnostic approach. Conclusion It is necessary to rule out frequent treatable causes, thus involving both psychopatological and neuroscientific approach to psychiatric disturbances. However, while underlying causes are often difficult to treat, psychiatric symptoms respond to existing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of brain death is made based on the clinical and EEG criteria. Clinical criteria include deep coma, loss of spontaneous respiration, and loss of all the brain stem reflexes. EEG should show electrocortical silence. The EEG examination should fulfill the technical criteria proposed by the Japanese as well as the American EEG societies. In Japan, the Ministry of Health and Welfare criteria for brain death was presented in 1986 after the collaborative study headed by Professor Takeuchi. Those patients with metabolic and endocrine coma, and those under the influence of central nervous depressant drugs or low body temperature should be excluded. Japanese criteria is the most strict one compared to those of other western countries. The most important and frequent source of error in the diagnosis of brain death in which actually alive patients are misdiagnosed as brain death is inappropriate EEG examination. Unless the gain of EEG machine is increased to either 4 (2.5 microV/mm) or 5 (2 microV/mm) with long distance bipolar and monopolar leads, absence or presence of electrocortical silence cannot be evaluated. With this condition, it is imperative to prove that no brain-derived activities above 2 microV are present to make a diagnosis of electrocortical silence (flat EEG). The author believes that as long as the strict clinical and EEG criteria are carefully followed by a specialist, there would be no mistake in the diagnosis of brain death.",

However, MI is frequently accompanied by non-cardiovascular multiple comorbidities, including brain disorders such as stroke, anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment. Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence suggests a causal relationship between MI and stroke, but the precise underlying mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Indeed, the risk of stroke remains a current challenge in patients with MI, in spite of the improvement of medical treatment among this patient population has reduced the risk of stroke. In this review, the effects of the signaling from the ischemic heart to the brain, such as neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and neurogenesis, and the possible actors mediating these effects, such as systemic inflammation, immunoresponse, extracellular vesicles, and microRNAs, are discussed.",

      "title": "Fungal Meningoencephalitis Masquerading as Metabolic Encephalopathy: A Case Report in a 65-Year-Old Geriatric Patient",
      "abstract": "Highlight: A geriatric patient may present with subtle or nonspecific symptoms of meningoencephalitis, such as confusion, altered mental status, or lethargy, rather than classic signs like fever and neck stiffness. Negative CSF cultures of fungal infection should not delay the initiation of antifungal therapy. ABSTRACT Introduction: Infectious pathogens or autoimmune disorders can cause meningoencephalitis. Symptoms include headache, fever, altered mental status, seizure, or neurological deficits. Symptoms frequently manifest atypically in the elderly, which can result in delayed treatment. This case emphasizes how important it is to consider meningoencephalitis in elderly patients with altered consciousness, even without typical signs of it. Case: A 65-year-old female with a history of recurrent hyponatremia and hypokalemia arrived at the emergency room with sudden loss of consciousness, vomiting, and behavioral changes that persisted for a week. The neurological examination and brain CT scan revealed no abnormalities. Severe electrolyte imbalances prompted the initial diagnosis of metabolic encephalopathy. Following progressive electrolyte correction, the patient’s mental condition improved. On the second day, she had generalized seizures and developed right-sided hemiparesis. An MRI of the head with contrast showed thicker dura mater and leptomeningeal enhancement in both hemispheres, indicating meningoencephalitis. Ceftriaxone and dexamethasone were administered intravenously, along with levetiracetam, to treat seizures. The next day, cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed Candida spores, but cultures were negative. Intravenous fluconazole was then added to the therapy. Throughout her two-week stay, the patient’s neurological condition improved consistently. Conclusion:Fungal causes should be considered in cases with unclear meningoencephalitis in the elderly, even if fever or meningeal signs are not present. Although CSF culture continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing fungal CNS infection, negative results should not delay the start of antifungal therapy. Early initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy is crucial for successful results in these cases.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that Subacute Sclerosing PanEncephalitis (SSPE) is due to an aborted form of the wild measles virus which results from a faulty immune reaction of the human body (1). The pathogenesis of this particular slow virus disease begins when an immunologically incompetent individual is attacked by the virus and is thereby unable to launch a full immune response, allowing parts of the aborted virus to harbor in the central nervous system. As is typical of all slow virus diseases, the aborted virus remains quiescent for a number of months to years only to break out to produce the neurological and ophthalmic symptoms of SSPE. The major components of the disease results from the progressive deterioration of the host’s nervous system, first starting with sometimes subtle and nonspecific higher cortical symptoms such as abnormal behavior, learning disabilities, single epileptic seizures and visual disturbances which formulate in months into a characteristic clinical period called stage I. Then the near diagnostic period of repetitive massive myoclonic jerks, beginning mental failure, motor disability in its early stages and immobility are seen which constitutes what has been called stage II. This stage is also progressive and in a few months the involuntary movements disappear and the dementia worsens. Stage III is a nonambulatory state of clinical affairs with ultimately complete motor failure, loss of the previously seen involuntary movements and severe dementia. Stage IV represents a severe “vegetative” stage which plateaus to severe neurological disability of at least 90% or death. This typical clinical progression is closely correlated with a rostral-caudal neural destruction. Most of what is thought to be clinically typical about this disease, is a manifestation of the neuropathological and clinical happenings which occur in stage II. This stage represents the classical subacute progressive clinical picture of what I call the subacute progressive form (SPF) of SSPE. There are other more atypical forms of the disease. The classical or SPF form and presentation represents only about 75% of the cases of SSPE which has been reported to the USA/World SSPE Registry since 1989. In the 1960s, in the heyday of SSPE and natural",

These subjects do not meet the clinical criteria for dementia, yet their cognitive functioning is below what we would expect for age and education in healthy people. In the other hand, older adults are at risk for sleep disorders including obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, REM sleep behavioral disorder and chronic insomnia, which could have an impact on cognitive functioning and are exclusion criteria for the MCI diagnosis. Moreover, REM sleep behavioral disorder represents a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In subjects more 65 years of age the association between chronic insomnia and cognitive changes is still debated. The main aim of this paper is to focus on identification of sleep disorders in the context of cognitive disturbances among professionals working with the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropathy occurs with various manifestations as a consequence of lymphoma, and an understanding of the etiology is necessary for proper treatment. Advances in medical imaging have improved the detection of peripheral nerve involvement in lymphoma, yet tissue diagnosis is often equally important. The neoplastic involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in lymphoma can occur within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), inside the dura, or outside of the CSF space, affecting nerve root plexuses and peripheral nerves. The infiltration of either cranial or peripheral nerves in lymphoma is termed neurolymphomatosis (NL). These infiltrations can occur as mononeuropathy, multifocal neuropathy, symmetric neuropathies, or plexopathies. In rare cases, intravascular lymphoma (IL) can affect the PNS and an even rarer condition is the combination of NL and IL. Immune-mediated and paraneoplastic neuropathies are important considerations when treating patients with lymphoma. Demyelinating neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, occur more frequently in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma than in Hodgkin's disease. Paraproteinemic neuropathies can be associated with lymphoma and paraneoplastic neuropathies are rare. While the treatment of lymphomas has improved, a knowledge of neurotoxic, radiotherapy, neoplastic, immune-mediated and paraneoplastic effects are important for patient care.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

It is a form of extreme autonomic dysregulation leading to multiple episodes of sympathetic hyperactivity. The pathogenesis of this interesting entity is yet to be fully understood. It presents as unexplained tachycardia, hypertension, and sometimes hyperthermia. Poor awareness of this fact leads to unnecessary workup to look for the cause of fever and interventions such as change of antibiotics. If it is not treated adequately, it can even cause complications like arrhythmias that can be fatal at times. PSH secondary to acquired brain injury is better known in adults, but there are scarce reports in children. We describe six cases of PSH in children with acquired brain injury – four secondary to traumatic brain injury and two secondary to neurologic infection (one with bacterial meningitis and the other one with viral meningoencephalitis). PSH can be seen in non-traumatic brain injury cases like meningitis. Due to a lack of awareness about this common but under-recognized entity, it is seldom diagnosed and treated. Early detection and treatment can be life-saving and improve patient outcomes. Earlier onset may be associated with poorer outcomes and mortality.",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, is characterized as frequent upper airway collapse and obstruction. It is a treatable disorder but if left untreated is associated with complications in several organ systems. The health risk to OSA patients shows a strong association with acute cardiovascular events, and with chronic conditions. To the central nervous system, OSA causes behavioral and neuropsychologic deficits including daytime sleepiness, depression, impaired memory, mood disorders, cognition deficiencies, language comprehension and expression deficiencies, all of which are compatible with impaired hippocampal function. Furthermore, there exists a significant correlation between disease severity and cognitive deficits in OSA. Children with severe OSA have significantly lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and executive control functions compared to normal children matched for age, gender and ethnicity. This corroborates the findings of several pediatric studies of cognition in childhood OSA, where deficits are reported in general intelligence and some measures of executive function. In studies of OSA, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of its two main pathologic traits, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation. Many OSA studies, utilize IH as the only exposure factor in OSA studies. These approaches simplify research process and attain most of the academic goals. IH, continuous hypoxia and intermittent continuous hypoxia can all result in decreases in arterial O2. There are striking differences to them in the response of physiological systems. There are multiple studies showing that IH treatment in a rodent model of OSA can impair performance of standard water maze tests associated with deficits in spatial learning and memory which most likely are hippocampal-dependent. Cellular damage to the hippocampal cornuammonis 1 (CA1) region likely contributes to neuropsychological impairment among OSA patients, since neural circuits in the hippocampus are important in learning and memory. In this article, studies of hippocampal impairments from IH are reviewed for elucidating the mechanisms and relationships between hippocampal impairments and IH of OSA.",

      "title": "Neurocognitive screening in sickle cell disease",
      "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited hemoglobinopathies, is associated with high rates of neurological complications, particularly ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarction.1 Silent cerebral infarction is now considered the most common neurological complication of SCD, affecting 39% of children with HbSS or HbSβ0 thalassemia by 18 years of age, and up to 50% of adults with HbSS or HbSβ0 thalassemia by 30 years of age.2-4 However, silent cerebral infarction is not, in fact, silent. It is associated with several symptoms, including deficits in cognition as well as an increased risk of future stroke and silent cerebral infarction.5 In the latest American Society of Hematology SCD Clinical Practice Guidelines on Sickle Cell Disease for cerebrovascular disease,6 the authors “placed a higher value on maintaining cognitive function than on being alive with significantly less than baseline cognitive function.” Neurocognitive evaluation is recommended after positive developmental surveillance by a hematologist or clinician, followed by positive formal developmental screening by a primary care provider or psychologist or after stroke or silent cerebral infarction have been diagnosed. While we agree with the guidelines in general, we question whether preservation of cognitive function is achievable if we are only making provisions for neurocognitive evaluation after neurocognitive dysfunction or structural brain injury has already occurred. Serial neurocognitive evaluation at regular intervals may detect impairment prior to the development of observable structural brain injury, allowing earlier introduction of disease-modifying and neuroprotective therapies as well as consideration of curative treatments, therapeutic services, and cognitive rehabilitation. We feel the guideline recommendation for neurocognitive testing after brain injury is not sufficient. As neurocognitive impairment has been found in patients with SCD with and without structural evidence of brain injury,7, 8 prevalence of these deficits is likely greater than the prevalence of silent cerebral infarcts. In addition, evidence from several studies and review articles indicates that progressive and subtle neurocognitive dysfunction is present in SCD, from as early as 1 year of age into adulthood.9-15 In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Disease, school-age children with SS-type SCD were shown to have decreasing scores in verbal IQ and math achievement.16 Data from the BABY HUG study showed worsening behavior and adaptive functioning with increasing age in toddlers with SCD.17 Adults with SCD and no prior history of neurological diagnoses, normal neurological examinations, and normal neuroimaging were found to have deficits in performance IQ, full-scale IQ, working memory, and processing speed in comparison to community controls.8 The guidelines state that children with SCD should be surveilled for neurocognitive difficulties by their hematologists and, if positive, should be referred to a primary care provider or a psychologist capable of performing formal screening. We take issue with this “gatekeepers” approach. Given that children with SCD are already known to be at increased risk for neurocognitive impairment, we propose that baseline testing and periodic re-evaluation should be the standard of care, as is done with other high-risk pediatric populations (e.g., premature and low birth-weight infants, children with congenital heart disease, pediatric oncology patients, children with epilepsy, etc.).18 Per the neurodevelopmental guidelines developed for high-risk congenital heart disease patients, direct referral for formal developmental/medical evaluation and services with periodic re-evaluation at 12–24 months, 3–5 years, and 11–12 years of age is indicated.19 In children with diagnosed neurodevelopmental disabilities, comprehensive re-evaluation is indicated at the times of educational transition, specifically the start/end of elementary, middle, and high school. Another study recommended cognitive evaluations prior to school entry and during transition to adult medical care for children with SCD.11 These modifications would enable providers to better document longitudinal change and institute appropriate interventions. Surveillance and screening for neurodevelopmental concerns are fundamental parts of well-child visits; however, for patients with SCD, these components may not be performed because of the need to address competing medical and psychosocial issues during clinic visits. There is still significant likelihood that children with SCD and developmental concerns will be missed by the screening/surveillance approach or that patients will not be referred for appropriate evaluation and treatment. In addition, the outcome of screening is “risk.” Children with SCD are already at higher neurocognitive risk. Consequently, the appropriate course of action is evaluation. Children with SCD should be assessed by providers who are aware of the impact of SCD on neurocognitive outcome, and who are capable of determining what level of evaluation is necessary. We acknowledge the perception that neuropsychological testing is difficult to assess, but we would respond that these challenges are not insurmountable, as demonstrated by the services provided to other high-risk pediatric populations mentioned above. We should expand our scope and provide adequate care to this often underserved population. Universal baseline neurodevelopmental evaluation for all children with SCD is achievable through early referral by either hematologists or pediatricians to a specific neurodevelopmental provider experienced with SCD, embedded neuropsychological or neurodevelopmental services in pediatric hematology clinics, or formal psycho-educational assessment through local schools. Importantly, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with SCD are eligible for a multidisciplinary team evaluation, because of their elevated disease-associated neurocognitive risk; thus, some form of neurocognitive assessment should be available to all children with SCD from birth to high school graduation or age 21 years. The new guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for cognitive surveillance and screening, and call for research to improve the implementation and neurocognitive evaluation and specific cognitive rehabilitation. However, without including a recommendation for a standard baseline comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation for every person with SCD, we feel the stated goal of protecting neurocognitive functioning will not be achieved. We must identify and refer children with neurocognitive difficulties for early evaluation with an experienced neurodevelopmental provider familiar with sequelae from vascular brain injury and the specific evolving subtle deficits these patients have across the lifespan; as the authors of the guidelines note, “both stroke and silent cerebral infarcts are associated with significant cognitive impairments that may significantly alter educational attainment, employment status, and quality of life.” Early identification and intervention are often the key to modifying the developmental trajectory. We, as providers, should endeavor to start that process as early as possible. None. Eboni I. Lance served on an advisory board for Novartis. James F.

It also includes postsurgical patients, in whom exacerbation of muscle weakness from MG causes a delay in extubation. MC is a very important, serious, and reversible neurological emergency that affects 20–30% of the myasthenic patients, usually within the first year of illness and maybe the debut form of the disease. Most patients have a predisposing factor that triggers the crisis, generally an infection of the respiratory tract. Immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, and steroids are the cornerstones of immunotherapy. Today with the modern neurocritical care, mortality rate of MC is less than 5%.",

Although physical and occupational therapy are the primary way weakness is addressed, potassium channel blockade has been shown to improve ambulation due to the improved conduction in demyelinated fibers. The grading of the degree of impairment is important not only to anticipate function, but also because partial transverse myelitis is associated with a higher likelihood of future diagnosis of a polyphasic demyelinating disorder.

      "title": "Rapidly Progressive Dementia - Clinical Aspects and Management",
      "abstract": "Although no precise definition for rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) exists, this term is generally used to refer to cases with significant and progressive cognitive impairment that occurs over weeks or months. RPD represents an unusual but severe condition that causes distress not only for patients and their relatives but also for the clinicians involved, as multiple investigations and decisions about management must be made urgently to avoid misdiagnosing a treatable condition and to preserve as much of the neural tissue as possible from definite damage. While Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) has for a long period of time been regarded as the prototype of RPD, this infrequent but severe condition can be produced by an extensive variety of causes such as various endocrine, metabolic or toxic disorders, central nervous system (CNS) infections, primary or secondary CNS neoplasms, various CNS vasculitides and various autoimmune conditions in which autoantibodies against neural tissue are produced, whether in the presence of a neoplasm or not. However, even in the more common and usually slowly progressive dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies and other degenerative dementias, as well as vascular dementia, establishment and progression of the disease is occasionally surprisingly accelerated, leading to a clinical presentation of RPD. The few published case series of RPD have shown that the relative frequency of underlying diseases depends mainly on the clinical setting. Thus, CJD has been found to be the most prevalent cause in referral centres for spongiform encephalopathies, while secondary causes are more prevalent in general referral centres for dementia diagnosis. In clinical practice, for the cases presenting with RPD, the diagnostic procedure must be exhaustive, starting with a detailed clinical evaluation and proceeding to a complete laboratory work-up and sophisticated neuroimaging studies. There has been recent enormous progress in imaging, with sensitive new sequences of magnetic resonance imaging and immunology; as a result, a plethora of antibodies against the CNS can now be detected in cases of autoimmune dementias, which has dramatically changed the diagnostic approach and early management of cases of RPD. The same favourable effect in clinical practice comes from the accumulated knowledge of the complex clinical picture of various causes of RPD, associated specific neurological features (pyramidal signs, ataxia, myoclonus) and systematic features (weight loss, hyponatraemia, hepatic disorders) and their mode of progression.",

      "abstract": "The presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities does not necessarily predict the development of neurosyphilis. The characteristic spinal cord syndrome associated with parenchymatous neurosyphilis is tabes dorsalis. A more rapid development of neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals than would otherwise be expected may result from the impairment of delayed hypersensitivity. Despite the associated immunosuppression, serum nontreponemal titers at the time of presentation of neurosyphilis in the HIV-infected individual are typically high, averaging 1:128. In general, those neurologic manifestations occurring early in syphilis, namely, asymptomatic neurosyphilis and syphilitic meningitis, are readily treatable and typically resolve without neurologic sequelae. Dependence on the CSF for determining the adequacy of treatment for neurosyphilis in HIV-infected individuals often yields inaccurate results, due to the frequency with which CSF abnormalities are detected with HIV infection alone. Neurosyphilis is broadly defined as the occurrence of neurological complications due to infection with Treponema pallidum. While the diagnosis of syphilis is relatively straightforward with serum tests for demonstration of treponeme or immune response to this pathogen, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis is more complicated. The goal of neurosyphilis treatment is to reach treponemicidal levels of penicillin in the CSF. The best determinant of treatment adequacy for neurosyphilis is the resolution of CSF abnormalities, although it often yields inaccurate results in HIV patients because of irregularities due to HIV infection alone. HIV-seropositive patients should be monitored for neurosyphilis relapse for at least 2 years following treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: La encefalomielitis aguda diseminada es una enfermedad desmielinizante aguda del sistema nervioso central, generalmente se relaciona con una infección viral o inmunización; además se asocia a encefalopatía aguda y síntomas neurológicos multifocales. Presentación del caso: Se trata de escolar de sexo femenino sin antecedentes patológicos de importancia ni evidencia de inmunizaciones previas al padecimiento, con cuadro de intolerancia a la vía oral y datos de somnolencia además de presencia de convulsiones y cambios en el comportamiento durante estancia en el servicio de urgencias, con deterioro del estado de conciencia, por lo que requiere manejo avanzado de la vía área y por clínica valorada por el servicio de Neurología. Este último solicita resonancia magnética y se encuentra presencia de múltiples lesiones hiperintensas que involucra sustancia blanca redonda de bordes bien delimitados. Por lo anterior y por evolución clínica, se inicia esquema con esteroides y por no respuesta clínica recibe manejo con inmunoglobulina intravenosa, posteriormente con recuperación gradual de la sintomatología motora, y se envía a seguimiento en la consulta externa con el servicio de neurología. Conclusión: Esta patología constituye un dilema diagnóstico desde la etapa inicial de los síntomas, el padecer esta enfermedad no diagnosticada o no tratada de manera adecuada tiene mayor riesgo de secuelas devastadoras, aunque la parte neurocognitiva es favorable. Por lo anterior, siempre se debe tener en cuenta entre los diagnósticos diferenciales de pacientes con patología del sistema nervioso central con antecedentes de inmunizaciones e infecciones en las últimas 2 semanas.",

It deteriorates functional status and quality of life, particularly ambulation, micturition control, and cognitive ability. NPH patients for which there is no identifiable cause are classified as idiopathic NPH, while cases with preceding insults are classified as secondary NPH. Diagnosis is crucial and mainly relies on clinical information and brain imaging. Occasionally, therapeutic diagnosis by spinal tap test is required. Surgery for permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is the mainstay treatment for this condition. Early surgical treatment usually results in a favorable outcome. Most NPH patients are elderly and often have associated major medical conditions, so the benefits of CSF diversion should be weighed against the risks associated with the procedure. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is the most commonly used procedure, with lum bo peritoneal (LP) shunt being used with increasing frequency in the treatment of NPH.",

It consists of bilateral optic or retrobulbar neuritis and ascending myelitis manifested by paraplegia of the upper motor neuron type, which is commonly preceded by sensory disturbances. As pointed out in the standard textbooks of neurology and in a recent and excellent review of the literature by Silbermann, 3 this condition must be differentiated from the more acute encephalomyelitis arising spontaneously or after acute infections, from encephalitis periaxialis diffusa (Schilder's disease), which occurs in infancy and in childhood, and from the more chronic and relapsing multiple sclerosis.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is caused by a measles virus that may be sequestered in the cell rather than eradicated; the disease occurs between the ages of 4 and 20. Progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP) is caused by a rubella virus that persists in the CNS; its onset is about a decade after rubella-virus infection. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by a papovavirus that lyses oligodendrocytes; it usually occurs between the ages of 50 and 60. All three disorders are characterized by usually slow mental and motor deterioration; patients with SSPE and PRP also have myoclonic seizures. The pathogenesis of these diseases is not yet understood, and there is no effective treatment. Death occurs within months to years.",

      "title": "Animal models of toxic and metabolic sensory neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathies, excluding those caused by mechanical damage, are most commonly associated with infection, autoimmune disorders, and exposure to neurotoxins or metabolic disease. The sensory nervous system may be selectively damaged, as occurs in platinum toxicity, or there may be a more generalized sensorimotor neuropathy. Symptoms of sensory dysfunction range from sensory loss to inappropriate or exaggerated pain perception and a variety of sensory disorders may occur together or in chronological sequence. For example, while sensory loss is the predominant symptom of diabetic polyneuropathy, 5-10% of patients exhibit a painful neuropathy that may either precede or co-exist with sensory loss. Pain, paresthesias or dysesthesias are a common feature of many peripheral neuropathies but are difficult to quantify in animal models. It is particularly unfortunate that both leprosy and HIV have proven extremely difficult to model in animals that lend themselves to experimental studies of nociceptive processing. As a result, little is yet known of the mechanisms that produce these most prevalent of neuropathies. In recent years, sensory dysfunction has been described in animal models of chemical neurotoxicity and diabetes mellitus. Such models are of value as they allow investigation of the etiology of neuropathic pain and because they provide test systems in which to study potential therapeutic agents that may prevent or ameliorate neuropathic pain. In this chapter we will briefly consider the animal models of toxic neuropathies, which largely produce sensory loss, and then focus upon data obtained from the widely studied animal models of diabetic neuropathy.",

They can be classified according to the number and distribution of nerves affected or may be categorized based on their causative mechanism. Neuropathy affecting one nerve is called mononeuropathy whereas neuropathy affecting multiple nerves is called polyneuropathy. The term mononeuritis multiplex is applied when one or more separate nerves in disparate areas are affected. In this chapter, we classify the neuropathies based on the underlying pathology. Neuropathies are subcategorized into axonal type (associated with axonal degeneration) or demyelinating type (associated with segmental demyelination).",

      "abstract": "La Esclerosis Multiple es una enfermedad neurologica clinicamente heterogenea donde los sintomas son producidos por mecanismos patogenicos inmunes en relacion a la inflamacion del Sistema Nervioso Central , desmielinizacion y degeneracion axonal, la causa es todavia desconocida. Afecta sobre todo a pacientes adultos jovenes en pleno desarrollo de sus actividades sociales, laborales y familiares, por lo que alteraciones en las funciones superiores cobran, si cabe, mayor importancia al interferir notablemente en la calidad de vida de los pacientes y de su entorno. El deterioro cognitivo severo es poco frecuente dentro de la enfermedad, los ultimos estudios hablan de menos del 5%. Sin embargo la presencia de DC ya en etapas iniciales de la enfermedad objetivado con diferentes test es de entre el 40 al 70% de los pacientes. El patron cognitivo muestra alteraciones en el razonamiento abstracto, problemas de atencion, velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y deficit de memoria reciente. El grado de deterioro se ha relacionado con la carga lesional y atrofia cerebral en resonancia magnetica , el tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad, el grado de discapacidad y se ha implicado tanto a sustancia blanca como a sustancia gris . Otros factores que pueden incidir en el rendimiento cognitivo de estos pacientes pueden ser la depresion y la fatiga, sintomas frecuentes en pacientes con EM. La homocisteina es un aminoacido que se sintetiza en el organismo a partir de la metionina, se ha demostrado que su nivel aumentado en plasma es un factor de riesgo independiente de ateroesclerosis y de enfermedad tromboembolica. Su aumento se produce principalmente por alteraciones geneticas en las enzimas encargadas de su produccion o bien por factores dieteticos. En los ultimos anos se ha investigado su posible relacion con el DC en varias enfermedades neurologicas como en la Enfermedad de Alzheimer o en la Enfermedad de Parkinson dado su efecto toxico a nivel de SNC a diferentes niveles de actuacion. En la EM tambien hay hallazgos que encuentran una posible relacion entre hiperhomocisteinemia y mayor grado de DC en estos pacientes. Parece interesante profundizar en dicha linea, dada la importancia del DC y su influencia en la calidad de vida de los pacientes .A partir de los resultados obtenidos en el estudio en las diferentes pruebas aplicadas y del posterior analisis estadistico realizado, podemos concluir: En nuestra muestra no se ha demostrado que pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Deterioro Cognitivo asocien niveles elevados de homocisteina. No se ha hallado ningun dominio cognitivo especifico afectado asociado a hiperhomocisteinemia. La fatiga y la depresion no se muestran como factores asociados al Deterioro Cognitivo. El 67 % de los pacientes han presentado Deterioro Cognitivo. Los dominios que se han visto mas afectados han sido la velocidad de procesamiento de informacion y la atencion. El test mas sensible para la deteccion de Deterioro Cognitivo en pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple ha resultado el Symbol Digit Modalities Test. No se han encontrado diferencias en cuanto a presencia de Deterioro Cognitivo entre pacientes con Esclerosis Multiple y Sindrome Clinico Aislado. Se ha asociado el Deterioro Cognitivo a mayor edad, menor nivel de estudios, formas progresivas de la Esclerosis Multiple, mayor tiempo de evolucion de la enfermedad y discapacidad medida por la EDSS.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke has been a common cause of death and disability in Taiwan, particularly among the elderly. Social isolation is a significant issue in an aging society, which can be associated with delayed medical care and difficulties in diagnosis.A 76-year-old man presented with altered mental status, left-sided weakness, and declining cognitive function over three months. He had limited social connections and an unknown medical history. Initial brain imaging showed communicating hydrocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed increased lymphocytes and high protein levels. Further imaging revealed multiple hyperintense lesions in the brain's white matter and acute ischemic stroke in specific areas. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculosis and HIV coinfection, leading to probable tuberculous meningitis, HIV encephalopathy, and pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Treatment with antituberculous agents, antibiotics, and steroids improved the patient's level of consciousness.Addressing social isolation and altered consciousness in elderly individuals requires a thoughtful approach. Reconsidering the differential diagnosis is crucial when it doesn't match the clinical severity. Clinicians should consider rare co-occurrences like ischemic stroke, TBM, and HIV infection in atypical TBM cases. A biopsychosocial perspective helps gather a comprehensive medical history for holistic care. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are vital for better outcomes in severe infections.",

      "abstract": "Encephalitis/encephalopathy is a neurological syndrome characterized by acute onset, symptoms of intracranial hypertension accompanying severe sequels or death. Encephalitis is caused by microbial infection of central nervous system, such as neurotrophic or conventional viruses. Infectious encephalopathy shows similar clinical symptoms to acute encephalitis, without any evidence of inflammation and microbial infection in brain tissues. The national epidemiological surveillance of the diseases is carried out to study the frequency and prognosis of patients with both diseases. The principal treatment is quite different in the both, in the former the eradication of microbial from the brain and in the latter the reduction of pressure of brain edema. Furthermore, the improvement of the brain with severe destruction requires such new step to reduce the activities of enzymes or cytokines to destroy brain tissues, as a mild hypothermia to lower body and brain temperature to 33-34 degrees C.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia but other neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, cerebrovascular disease and chronic infections such as syphilis can also lead to the clinical syndrome of dementia. Initial investigations should always focus on finding any treatable cause for dementia such as HIV, structural lesions such as subdural haematomas or specific nutritional deficiency states such as that due to vitamin B12 and treated appropriately. Where no treatable or reversible aetiology is found, a referral to a specialist should be considered who may initiate further investigations including magnetic resonance imaging or perfusion single-photon emission computerised tomography scans of the brain, and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid examination or an electroencephalogram.",

Seven patients without a prior history of migraine experienced a limited series of migraine-like attacks associated with abnormalities of the CSF. The episodic, severe headaches were preceded and accompanied by sensory, motor, speech, and visual disturbances. The CSF showed a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein, and elevated opening pressure. All seven patients recovered completely. We postulate that the migrainous episodes were symptomatic of an underlying inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. This distinctive combination of symptoms and CSF findings constitutes a benign syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Encephalitis is commonly caused by viruses. But beyond viruses there are so many causes of encephalitis. Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain parenchyma due to any reason. As there are so many causes of encephalitis presentations are also variable. So to diagnose encephalitis a set of clinical, laboratory, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging criteria is used. Any children attend medical facility with sudden onset altered mental status along with any of the following features like fever, seizure, focal neurological signs should be evaluated as encephalitis. Viruses are the common cause of encephalitis. Along with infectious etiologies a vast group of noninfectious like autoimmune causes encephalitis also established. When children presented with above mentioned features along with behavior problem and or movement disorder there is a high suspicion of autoimmune etiology. Any suspected case of encephalitis should initiated treatment with antiviral along with supportive treatment; then step wise evaluation should be done to reach an etiological diagnosis. If infectious etiology could not be established or no significant improvement is found with antiviral therapy; immunomodulating therapy should be considered along. In all cases CSF analysis including biochemistry, cytology, viral PCR along with MRI and EEG should do; further investigations depend upon initial reports and clinical and epidemiological background. Dose and duration of antiviral depends on patient's age and response to treatment and comorbidity. Acyclovir 500mg/m²/BSA per dose 3 times daily for 21 days are adequate for HSV encephalitis. Monitoring of renal function is the essential. Adjuvant treatment with steroid and or manitol for cerebral edema and antiseizure drugs for convulsion is used where necessary. Meticulous fluid and nutritional support as well good general care improve outcome. In spite of adequate treatment of encephalitis mortality and morbidity was found a significant number of cases; among the morbidity behavior problem, seizure focal deficit are common.",

We review all Henoch–Schönlein cases published after 1969 with CNS dysfunction without severe hypertension and neuroimaging studies (n = 35), cranial or peripheral neuropathy (n = 15), both CNS and peripheral nervous system dysfunction without severe hypertension (n = 2) or nervous system dysfunction with severe hypertension (n = 2). Forty-four of the 54 patients were <20 years of age. Results. In patients with CNS dysfunction without or with severe hypertension the following presentations were observed in decreasing order of frequency: altered level of consciousness, convulsions, focal neurological deficits, visual abnormalities and verbal disability. Imaging studies disclosed the following lesions: vascular lesions almost always involving two or more vessels, intracerebral haemorrhage, posterior subcortical oedema, diffuse brain oedema and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Following lesions were noted in the subjects with cranial or peripheral neuropathy without severe hypertension: peroneal neuropathy, peripheral facial palsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, brachial plexopathy, posterior tibial nerve neuropathy, femoral neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex. Persisting signs of either CNS (n = 9) or peripheral (n = 1) nervous system dysfunction were sometimes reported. Conclusions. In Henoch–Schönlein syndrome, signs of nervous system dysfunction are uncommon but clinically relevant. This review helps clinicians managing Henoch–Schönlein syndrome with nervous system dysfunction.",

Some examples are intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, and savant syndrome. Neurocognitive disabilities are the most difficult to diagnose often times because of their invisibility. Providing services for people with neurocognitive disabilities is very difficult, and people with these disabilities are among the most vulnerable populations in today's society.

The dementia that follows head injuries or repetitive mild trauma may be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, alone or in conjunction with other neurodegenerations (for example, Alzheimer's disease).

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric manifestations in adult lupus patients are common but not always serious. They may occur early or late in the course of lupus, may be the presenting feature of lupus and can be a challenge to manage. The most common manifestations early in the disease are headache, mood disorders and anxiety, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and acute confusional state. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations that may occur include movement disorders such as chorea, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve and peripheral neuropathies and myasthenia gravis. Neuropsychiatric features may be due to inflammatory mechanisms related to lupus, thrombosis usually due to antiphospholipid antibodies, atherosclerosis or co-morbid conditions, of which infection is the most important not to misdiagnose. Being aware of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms for different neuropsychiatric manifestations will ensure prompt and appropriate investigations and treatment. Investigations may include MRI and in selected cases other forms of imaging, CSF examination, neurophysiology and cognitive function testing. Therapy may include immunosuppressants, anticoagulation, antiplatelet agents and treatment specific to the clinical presentation. Most headaches in lupus patients are not due to lupus but the possibility of aseptic meningitis, benign intracranial hypertension, cerebral haemorrhage and venous thrombosis should be considered. Seizures may be part of the initial presentation of lupus and unless recurrent or associated with abnormalities on imaging do not require long term therapy with anticonvulsants. Cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke is more common later in the disease, and is more often due to atherosclerosis, thrombosis or emboli than haemorrhage or vasculitis. Chorea is usually associated with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. Transverse myelitis may be due to inflammatory or thrombotic mechanisms and is not always associated with abnormalities on MRI scan at the time of the acute event. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce the risk of permanent disability. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None Declared",

After connatal ptosis with or without involvement of other bulbar muscles the different types of muscular dystrophies are mentioned. Myositis, disturbances of potassium regulation and myasthenia gravis are other causes of ptosis. Diseases involving the oculomotor nerve (aneurysm, upper herniation, cavernous sinus thrombosis, orbital cavity processes, superior orbital fissure syndrome) may lead to associated ptosis. Metabolic disturbances, such as diabetes mellitus, Wernicke's encephalopathy and botulism may be accompanied by ptosis. Infectious diseases such as polyneuritis, meningitis or encephalitis can lead to ptosis. Sympatholytic ptosis is due to diseases of the central or peripheral course of the sympathetic nerve from the diencephalon via the cervical medulla, the neck, internal carotid artery to the superior orbital fissure. This type of ptosis is usually accompanied by miosis and often by sweating loss on the same side.",

One should consider dangerous complications of COVID-19 such as stroke, including cerebral venous thrombosis, autoimmune encephalitis and myelitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Guillain–Barre’ syndrome. Disorders of consciousness, disorders of smell and taste, headache and dizziness are significantly more often present in the acute period of COVID-19. Long-term persistence of complaints and disorders after COVID-19 is regarded as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Neurological complaints and disorders in a patient who has had COVID-19 are often caused by the development or exacerbation of a comorbid disease, including primary headache, musculoskeletal pain in the neck and back, various vestibular disorders, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety and depressive disorders. Unfortunately, in real clinical practice, these diseases are often not diagnosed, patients are observed with a diagnosis of PCS, and it is not taken into account that the basis for diagnosing PCS is the exclusion of other diseases that can explain complaints and disorders in a patient who has suffered from COVID-19.",

Although SH and IDD co-occur often, cases of schizophrenia in SH with IDD are less commonly reported. A thorough search of scientific databases with keywords of IDD, SH, and schizophrenia on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar combined yielded limited results, prompting us to report this case of SH without any history of seizures who developed hebephrenic Schizophrenia.

Hypercytosis with moderate elevation of albumin C.S.F., a high level of cyclic GMP, and a low concentration of IgG in C.S.F., are found in central neurological complications in SLE. Other biological alterations are described but both their signification and their interest, as well for diagnostic as for therapeutic supervision, are unknown.

In particular, the specificity of brain MR angiography (MRA) and cerebral angiography is low. Although PACNS is rare, it should be on the differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained neurologic deficits referable to the CNS alone, as the condition is fatal without prompt treatment. A diagnosis of PACNS is made only after excluding secondary causes of CNS vasculitis such as infections, malignancies, autoimmune conditions, reversible cerebral vasoconstrictive disease, and medications.

Detailed, prospective, multidisciplinary neurobehavioral evaluations are ongoing in 72 HIV+, largely asymptomatic patients; plus 62 normal, depressed, or neurologic diseased controls. We have shown variable abnormalities in EEG, EPs, & MRI, as well as more consistent abnormalities in CSF & specific cognitive tasks of attention & information processing. This latter occurs in a subgroup of HIV+ patients, but not in depressed controls, & is associated with otherwise normal performance on standard tests of intelligence, language, & memory. Performance on reaction time tasks has been shown to deteriorate over time & is highly correlated with changes in CSF quinolinic acid, an excitatory neurotoxin. However, it must be emphasized that the presence of these abnormalities per se cannot at present be translated into an indication of impaired job performance. Phase II studies will establish the incidence of information processing disorders in HIV+ patients by using a briefer but more focused battery in a larger & less biased population. A brief neurobehavioral screening battery has been developed & successfully tested for use in therapeutic trials. In collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry, we will also explore the interaction between these findings & psychiatric & psychosocial variables. MRI, CSF, EEF, & other CNS biologic abnormalities uncovered in Phase I, will be pursued in the original patients as well as in a subgroup of new patients, including more advanced patients with AIDS.",

      "abstract": "Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of uncommon clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterised by myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, and neurological deterioration, including dementia and ataxia. PMEs may have infancy, childhood, juvenile or adult onset, but usually present in late childhood or adolescence, at variance from epileptic encephalopathies, which start with polymorphic seizures in early infancy. Neurophysiologic recordings are suited to describe faithfully the time course of the shock-like muscle contractions which characterize myoclonus. A combination of positive and negative myoclonus is typical of PMEs. The gene defects for most PMEs (Unverricht-Lundborg disease, Lafora disease, several forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers [MERRF], and type 1 and 2 sialidoses) have been identified. PMEs are uncommon disorders, difficult to diagnose in the absence of extensive experience. Thus, aetiology is undetermined in many patients, despite the advance in molecular medicine. Treatment of PMEs remains essentially symptomaticof seizures and myoclonus, together with palliative, supportive, and rehabilitative measures. The response to therapy may initially be relatively favourable, afterwards however, seizures may become more frequent, and progressive neurologic decline occurs. The prognosis of a PME depends on the specific disease. The history of PMEs revealed that the international collaboration and sharing experience is the right way to proceed. This emerging picture and biological insights will allow us to find ways to provide the patients with meaningful treatment.",

In this presentation, classical genetic disorders affecting the optic nerve will be discussed with a particular focus on Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a primary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorder and three point mutations within the mitochondrial genome account for the vast majority of cases, namely: m.3460G>A, m.11778G>A and m.14484T>C. It typically affects young adult males who present with bilateral severe visual loss in the second or third decade of life. In addition to the canonical LHON mutations, other pathogenic mtDNA mutations have been reported that can result in both syndromic and non-syndromic optic neuropathies. Acute visual loss in genetic disorders can also be secondary to pathology involving the retrochiasmal visual pathways, for example, in MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). The cardinal clinical manifestations in this group of patients are homonymous hemianopic visual field defects or cortical blindness.",

      "abstract": "The clinical presentation and course of patients with mitochondrial syndromes are extremely diverse. These diseases may manifest at any age from birth until late adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some mitochondrial disorders affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), but many involve multiple organ systems. Many patients display an assemblage of clinical features that can be ascribed to a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). On the other hand, many other mitochondrial disorders do not clearly fit into one particular and recognizable syndrome category, and the spectrum of disease phenotypes can be broadly overlapping among several syndromes. All possible inheritance patterns can be found (maternal, X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and de novo occurrence) due to the dual involvement of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

      "abstract": "The past 15years have provided an unprecedented collection of discoveries that bear upon our scientific understanding of recovery of consciousness in the human brain following severe brain damage. Highlighted among these discoveries are unique demonstrations that patients with little or no behavioral evidence of conscious awareness may retain critical cognitive capacities and the first scientific demonstrations that some patients, with severely injured brains and very longstanding conditions of limited behavioral responsiveness, may nonetheless harbor latent capacities for recovery. Included among such capacities are particularly human functions of language and higher-level cognition that either spontaneously or through direct interventions may reemerge even at long time intervals or remain unrecognized.\r\nWhen patients in “persistent vegetative state” (recently coined unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) show minimal signs of consciousness but are unable to reliably communicate the term minimally responsive or minimally conscious state (MCS) is used. MCS was recently subcategorized based on the complexity of patients' behaviors: MCS+ describes high-level behavioral responses (i.e., command following, intelligible verbalizations or non-functional communication) and MCS- describes low-level behavioral responses (i.e., visual pursuit, localization of noxious stimulation or contingent behavior such as appropriate smiling or crying to emotional stimuli). Patients who show non-behavioral evidence of consciousness or communication only measurable via ancillary testing (i.e., functional MRI, positron emission tomography, EEG or evoked potentials) can be considered to be in a functional locked-in syndrome.\r\nTaken together, recent studies show that awareness is an emergent property of the collective behavior of frontoparietal top-down connectivity. Within this network, external (sensory) awareness depends on lateral prefrontal/parietal cortices while internal (self) awareness correlates with precuneal/mesiofrontal midline activity. Of clinical importance, this knowledge now permits to improve the care of patients with disorders of consciousness.\r\nReferences:\r\nComa and consciousness: Paradigms (re)framed by neuroimaging.

Because it may be an extreme form of a normal variant of activity level in normal children, the presence of excessive activity is not diagnostic in itself. The disorder, now called Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADDH), is also defined by exclusion. The diagnosis is reserved for children who are not markedly deficient in social and cognitive development; hence, they do not suffer from a schizophrenic or other psychotic disorder. Mood regulation is not grossly impaired, so that mania is thereby ruled out. This point is important because the concept of childhood hyperactivity used by many divergent groups such as parent organizations or educational institutions probably encompasses a broader range of pathology than the term implies when used by specialists in the field of study for the disorder. This discussion does not apply to hyperactive children with brain damage, mental retardation, seizure disorders or other neurological disorders, but to youngsters without known central nervous system disorders whose intellectual development is within the average range. As the name implies, hyperactive children display, for their age, high levels of motor activity. In addition, they also suffer from attentional deficits and impulsive behavior.

The purpose of this study is to emphasize the importance of identifying medical diseases in psychiatry. Objectives Medical diseases that develop most in comorbity with psychiatric disorders Identification of gravity of comorbidity symptoms Clinical progression Treatment efficacy/ Interaction of psychotropic medications with other medications. Methods Methodology: A regular clinical study strategy has been adopted, with adults aged 19-75 females and males diagnosed with mental disorders and one or more medical pathologies, including neurological diseases during a 10-year period (2010-2020) in ”Ali Mihali” Psychiatric Hospital, Vlora. Results They showed that medical diseases, such as: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, urinary infections, gastrointestinal disorders, acute and chronic bronchitis, severe brain injury often develop in comorbidity with mental disorders. Mental disorders that develop most in comorbity are: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, mood disorder. Treatment of these disorders is difficult due to the gravity of symptoms, interaction of medications, and side effects they have. Conclusions Mental disorders in comorbidity with medical diseases are usually hard to treat. For this reason, it is imperative to diagnose them the soonest possible. When mental and medical disorders are comorbid, their coexistence has grave symptoms, chronic progression, which affects functioning, quality of life, and increases health care costs.

These manifestations may be the earliest presenting signs and symptoms and they are so variable that the patient may be erroneously diagnosed as having conditions such as meningitis, poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage, lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and congenital malformations of the brain. Furthermore, development of these manifestations cannot be predicted on the basis of the type of crisis involved. Prognosis following neurological involvement is unpredictable, but recurrent episodes, together with abnormal electroencephalographic readings suggest a poor outcome. Such patients die or are the victims of rather severe neurological deficits. Neurological examination of these patients suggests diffuse involvement of the cerebral hemispheres. Examination of the pathological material, however, often fails to reveal thromboses. The striking findings are infarcts in the white matter and perivascular hemorrhages. The thesis that the abnormal neurological findings in these patients are actually due to sickle cell disease is supported by the fact that all such symptoms appear in association with clinical circumstances known to induce sickling. These include surgery and anesthesia, fever and infection.",

      "title": "Dementia and mild cognitive impairment in adults with intellectual disability: Issues of diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are now living longer with the majority of individuals reaching middle and even “old age.” As a consequence of this extended longevity they are vulnerable to the same age‐associated health problems as elderly adults in the general population without ID. This includes dementia, a general term referring to a variety of diseases and conditions causing substantial loss of cognitive ability and functional declines; adults with Down syndrome are at especially high risk. A great deal of recent effort has focused on the very earliest detectable indicators of decline (and even prodromal stages of dementia‐causing diseases). A condition called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been conceptually defined as a decline in functioning that is more severe than expected with typical brain aging but not severe enough to meet criteria for a diagnosis of dementia. Consensus criteria for both dementia and MCI have been developed for typically developing adults but are of limited applicability for adults with ID, given their pre‐existing cognitive impairments. Early diagnosis will continue to be of growing importance, both to support symptomatic treatment and to prevent irreversible neuropathology when interventions are developed to slow or halt the progression of underlying disease. While the intellectual and developmental disabilities field has for some time recognized the need to develop best‐practices for the diagnosis of MCI and dementia, there remains a pressing need for empirically based assessment methods and classification criteria. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "title": "A Case of Peripheral Nerve Hyperexcitability Syndrome Pretended as Infective Endocarditis: Case Report",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background: The peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) syndromes cause repetitive spontaneous electrical discharges in peripheral nerves (mainly motor axons), which leads to the increased activity of the innervated area. PNH syndromes develop various motor, sensory, and autonomous symptoms, of which motor symptoms are the most considerable, including cramps, fasciculations, and myokymia. The PNH syndromes are classified into cramp-fasciculation syndrome, neuromyotonia (Isaacs syndrome), and Morvan’s syndrome. Morvan syndrome is associated with the involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). PNH syndromes primarily result from dysfunction of voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKC), mainly due to autoantibodies. Alternative causes have been proposed, including potential infectious origins. Previous studies have associated staphylococcal abscesses and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infections with the pathogenesis of Isaacs syndrome rather than Morvan’s syndromes. Case Presentation: We present a case of VGKC-antibody-positive PNH presented by symptoms such as fatigue, fever, chills, dyspnea, weight loss, hyperhidrosis, spontaneous muscle spasms, and cramps in the lower limbs. Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement included hallucinations, sleep disorders, confusion, and mood alterations, along with vegetation in the right atrium as detected by echocardiography. The patient initially received a two-week course of antibiotic therapy for suspected infective endocarditis (IE) and bacteremia. Subsequently, due to persistent symptoms despite antibiotic treatment, electromyography (EMG) was performed, revealing anti-VGKC antibodies. The patient then underwent several plasma exchanges and was prescribed carbamazepine, resulting in a significant improvement in their condition. Conclusion: This case shares similarities with previous cases of PNH syndrome (especially Morvan’s syndromes) triggered by infections other than previously reported, suggesting that autoantibodies against pathogens may be responsible for the manifestation of PNH syndrome. Moreover, the dramatic response to plasmapheresis and removal of antibodies, as well as positive Anti-CASPR2 auto-antibody, confirms our diagnosis.",

В настоящее время диагноз дисциркуляторной энцефалопатии (ДЭП) или хронической ишемии головного мозга (ХИГМ) остается одним из самых распространенных в отечественной практике. В современной зарубежной литературе и неврологической практике не используется диагноз ДЭП или ХИГМ, но выделяются сосудистые когнитивные расстройства, которые расцениваются как основное проявление хронической цереброваскулярной патологии. Приводятся собственные данные автора, демонстрирующие, как под маской ДЭП/ХИГМ протекают другие неврологические (болезнь Альцгеймера, первичные головные боли, пери ерическая вестибулопатия) или психические заболевания. Ошибочный диагноз имеют более половины пациентов, наблюдающихся с диагнозом ДЭП/ХИГМ. Демонстрируются случаи, когда выявление первичной головной боли, истинной причины вестибулярного головокружения и адекватное их лечение позволяют помочь пациентам, которые длительно и безуспешно лечатся от ДЭП или ХИГМ. Обсуждаются вопросы профилактики развития и прогрессирования сосудистых когнитивных расстройств, важная роль коррекции факторов риска инсульта, лечения артериальной гипертензии и других заболеваний. Эффективное лечение сосудистых когнитивных расстройств имеет большее значение, по- скольку способно замедлить прогрессирование заболевания, привести к снижению часто- ты развития инсульта и деменции.

Estas se definen como un grupo de padecimientos de origen en muchos casos desconocido y que tienen como atributo común el curso progresivo de los síntomas derivados del daño estructural y funcional de diferentes zonas del sistema nervioso. La Demencia o Trastorno Cognitivo, ocurre cuando el cerebro se afecta por una enfermedad o afección específica que causa deterioro cognitivo. La secuencia en el espectro de la demencia puede terminar en la forma más grave de la enfermedad. El deterioro cognitivo en muchos casos transita desde el leve, referido a una disminución de la función cognitiva mayor de lo esperado por la edad y al nivel de educación del individuo, pero sin interferir con sus actividades cotidianas. El diagnóstico temprano de la enfermedad y la asunción de tratamientos y sobre todo estilos de vida saludables, puede evitar o enlentecer el tránsito hacia la gravedad de la enfermedad y por ende mejorar la calidad de vida. Con el objetivo de contribuir a este propósito se diseñó una herramienta de software denominada Neuromap que permite obtener patrones de conectividad a partir de señales de EEG y realizar una prueba de profundidad de la demencia. De esta forma se enriquecen los instrumentos con que cuentan en la actualidad los especialistas de las ciencias médicas para obtener un mejor y más eficaz diagnóstico.

Specific pathogenic antibodies have yet to be identified in most cases. It can also be seen in association with CNS infections, although it is unclear if the pathophysiology aligns more with an infectious or a para-infectious process. Here we describe a clinical case where a patient presented with OMS, with CSF findings indicative of a diagnosis of Neuroinvasive West Nile Virus disease. <h3>Design/Methods</h3> Case Report. <h3>Results</h3> A 65-year-old previously healthy man presented with 3 weeks of progressive generalized tremors, oscillopsia and inability to ambulate. Exam revealed opsoclonus, stimulus-induced myoclonus, and generalized ataxia. CSF showed neutrophil-predominant pleocytosis (325 WBCs with 78 neutrophils), which converted 3 days later to lymphocytic predominance (44 WBCs with 36 lymphocytes). CSF cultures, meningitis/encephalitis multiplex PCR array, brain MRI with and without contrast, body PET-CT and serum autoimmune encephalopathy panel were unrevealing. CSF WNV IgG and IgM were elevated to 2 times and 5 times the upper limit of assay respectively, concerning for Neuroinvasive WNV disease. He received 5 days of intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins with clinical improvement, and had ultimate resolution of symptoms over the next 6 months. <h3>Conclusions</h3> WNV has been associated with a wide spectrum of movement disorders, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially with CSF pattern as described above. Idiopathic and paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome remains the most common subtype, however it is important to perform an evaluation for infectious etiologies as well to guide further management and counseling regarding outcome.",

The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

The diseases affect either the upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, or both, and are characterized by weakness, atrophy, fasciculation, spasticity, and respiratory failure. We report a case of a 61-year-old male patient with no past history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, who presented with only dyspnea, and no indication of any other symptom such as muscle weakness, atrophy, or bulbar dysfunction. Neuromuscular conduction study, including a study of the phrenic nerve, confirmed the diagnosis of MND. The patient greatly improved giving respiratory assistance at night, using a noninvasive ventilator. This case indicates that MNDs should be considered as differential diagnoses for patients showing acute respiratory failure of unknown causes.

      "abstract": "Diagnostic challenges often arise when multiple central nervous system (CNS) lesions not accessible to biopsy are present on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The differential diagnosis is broad, particularly in the context of exposure to steroids and/or in the setting of immunosuppression. Benign lesions to be considered are demyelinating diseases, sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, and infectious diseases such as toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients and tuberculosis. Malignant lesions include CNS lymphoma, glioblastoma multiforme and brain metastases. The authors describe the clinical case of a 75-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronically medicated with Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg, Deflazacort 9 mg and Azathioprine 25 mg daily, who presented to the hospital with a 5-month history of progressive neurological deficits. It was particularly challenging, because the patient was immunocompromised, had multiple CNS lesions that were not accessible to biopsy and chronic therapy with corticosteroids altered the radiological pattern on brain MRI, masquerading the diagnosis. By writing up this case and review of the literature, further evidence is provided for loss of distinctive histological and radiographic findings of CNS lesions on steroid therapy, with a potential delay in diagnosis and subsequent worse prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from an inappropriate host response to infection. Encephalopathy occurs in more than 30% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased mortality and long-term psycho-cognitive disorders. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is characterized by impaired consciousness, ranging from delirium to coma, and by various electrophysiological changes, notably electrographic seizures in up to 15% of patients. Cerebral imaging can reveal white matter hyperintensities or ischemic stroke. Neuropathological examination often shows petechiae related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), axonal damage, and ischemia and, less often, abscesses in about 10% of cases. SAE is regarded as resulting from a combination of three mechanisms triggered by systemic inflammation: (i) neuroinflammation involving microglial cells activated by inflammatory mediators crossing a permeable blood-brain barrier (BBB); (ii) ischemia mainly related to macro- and microcirculatory dysfunction and DIC; (iii) neurotoxicity related to excitoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. There is no specific treatment for SAE, but treatment is aimed at general measures for controlling sepsis and preventing or treating delirium in patients who are critically ill.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "title": "Migraine variants and beyond.",
      "abstract": "Migraine is amongst the oldest of diseases known to mankind. Migraine is a heterogenous entity, usually characterised by periodic attacks of headache on one or both sides of the head. These may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Migraines are not always preceded by an aura and some migraines may not include headache. If migraine does not manifest itself in the form of headache but in some other form such as paroxysmal episodes of prolonged visual auras, atypical sensory, motor, or visual aura, confusion, dysarthria, focal neurologic deficits with or without a headache, it is labelled a Migraine Variant (MV). MV is therefore diagnosed by the history of paroxysmal symptoms with or without cephalgia and a prior history of migraine with aura, in the absence of other medical disorders that may contribute to the symptoms. Many of the MVs have been included and redefined in the revised edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) 2004 classification. These include hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine, childhood periodic syndromes, retinal migraine, complicated migraine and ophthalmoplegic migraine. Even though conditions such as vertiginous migraine, acute confusional migraine of childhood and nocturnal migraine are well recognized entities, they have not yet been included in IHCD-II, but will be discussed here in brief because they are relatively common conditions.",

      "abstract": "Background It is not so infrequent that a patient reports severe pain with a clear focus in/around the eye that looks like an atypical facial pain/persistent idiopathic facial pain. All the patients fulfilled DMS-IV criteria for depression or bipolar disorder-I and sleep and benzodiazepines overuse were reported as the only escape and cure treatment. This may or may not appear as a psychological flight reaction characterized by vegetative signs [1], or a medication-overuse headache. The diagnosis could be wrong even though the IHS/IASP and psychological criteria were respected. What could be the problem? We did not take into account that demodex is present even in man. Demodex -type A and type B-, the most serious non-neoplastic dermatological disease [2,3], is not so widely known in human pathology [4]. This ascaris provokes discomfort and pain, the severity of which depends on the extent and seriousness of the disease [2-4], as well as on the pain proneness evidenced in third hyperalgesia test we proved several years ago [5]. Thus, pain proneness and pain redundancy might be present in both migraine sufferers and in their relatives.",

COVID-19 is a new disease that is under study and affects people over 65 with the greatest severity worldwide. The most frequent psychiatric symptoms are behavioral disturbances and confusional syndrome among those affected. Objectives The objective is to demonstrate the importance of differential diagnosis in patients with psychiatric symptoms and covid-19. Methods Patients aged 71 and 77, admitted to psychiatry. They present drowsiness that alternates with episodes of psychomotor agitation in which they verbalize fear of the coronavirus. Personal history: bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Psychopathological exploration: Spatial-temporal disorientation, uncooperative, fluctuating state of consciousness, verborrheic, salty and incoherent speech at times. Dysphoric mood. Psychomotor restlessness predominantly at night, verbal heteroaggressiveness. Negative to ingestion due to odynophagia. Sensory-perceptual alterations and nihilistic delusions “the virus has killed me, I’m already dead.” Upon admission, they present a cough and fever and are treated with azithromycin and dexamethasone for suspected COVID-19. Complementary tests: chest X-ray bilateral pleural effusion. Cranial CT: Diffuse cortical and subcortical brain parenchyma retraction pattern. PCR positive coronavirus. Results After overcoming the infection and with psychopharmacological treatment the confusional syndrome remitted. Conclusions Confusional syndrome can present with different psychiatric symptoms, so the differential diagnosis is very important and even more so in patients older than 65 years who present somatic pathologies or acute infections. The differential diagnosis of confusional syndrome is key to adequate treatment and favor the prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Virtually all drug interventions that have been successful pre-clinically in experimental stroke have failed to prove their efficacy in a clinical setting. This could be partly explained by the complexity and heterogeneity of human diseases as well as the associated co-morbidities which may render neuroprotective drugs less efficacious in clinical practice. One aspect of crucial importance in the physiopathology of stroke which is not completely understood is neuroinflammation. At the present time, it is becoming evident that subtle, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease. Moreover, advanced aging and a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis could act as silent contributors promoting a chronic proinflammatory state. This could aggravate the outcome of various pathological entities and can contribute to a number of subsequent post-stroke complications such as dementia, depression and neurodegeneration creating a pathological vicious cycle. Moreover, recent data suggests that the inflammatory process might be closely linked with multiple neurodegenerative pathways related to depression. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines could play a central role in the pathophysiology of both depression and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral melioidosis is a rare entity which is minimally reported in literature, having multiple diagnostic challenges as it mimics most of the other diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Spectrum of CNS melioidosis depends on the entry of the organism and immune status of the patient. Due to the delay in diagnosis, it has a high morbidity and mortality. It is thought to be a disease of the immunocompromised with risk of exposure to soil or surface water. We present a case of an immunocompetent patient without any known risk factors for significant exposure, who presented with fever and rapidly progressive multiple cranial nerve palsies followed by reduced level of consciousness and cerebellar signs. She was eventually diagnosed to have encephalomyelitis, a form of neuro melioidosis, with radiological evidence of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and successfully treated with parenteral meropenem for intensive phase and cotrimoxazole for a long eradication phase. High index of suspicion and early initiation of treatment with suitable antibiotics for an optimal duration, evidenced complete recovery.",

The prevalence and the incidence of non-Alzheimer dementias vary according to the type of populations that are selected. The diagnosis rests on a triad consisting of focal neuropsychological deficits presenting in a context of dementia, focal cerebral atrophy affecting the temporal and/or frontal lobes, and the typical argyrophilic inclusions. The risk of dementia in association with cerebrovascular pathology is greater than any other known risk factor, including head injuries. The concept of vascular dementia most currently includes all dementias following cerebrovascular accidents whether ischaemic or haemorrhagic in nature. The disease in the majority of cases affects small vessels with subcortical-like deficits, to the extent that vascular dementia often fits the model of subcortical dementia.",

      "abstract": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a frequently fatal demyelinating disease of the brain caused by activation of the John Cunningham virus. It typically occurs in immunocompromised patients, including transplant recipients on immunosuppressant medications, patients receiving chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies, and patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for PML. By contrast, reversible progressive leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a generally treatable disorder that is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms (eg, altered mental status, visual abnormalities, headache, and seizures) and neuroradiographic changes (eg, cerebral edema). It is classically associated with malignant hypertension and immunosuppressive medications. Symptoms usually resolve over time, or with treatment of the underlying cause. Amid the relatively recent withdrawal of efalizumab from the US market because of its association with PML, and the added warning found on ustekinumab describing RPLS as a possible adverse effect, there has been an increasing level of concern in dermatology that biologics and other systemic medications used in the treatment of psoriasis may be related to an increased risk of specific leukoencephalopathies. In this review, we evaluate the association of prebiologics (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, acitretin) and biologics (eg, adalimumab, alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab, rituximab, and ustekinumab) with the potential risk of developing PML and RPLS.",

      "abstract": "Depression is intimately more related to the HIV infection. Patients with MDD may tend to have increased risk-taking behaviour and the substance use. HIV transmission or acquisition is more likely to the result from risky behaviour in the depressed individuals or mentally distressed individuals than in those who are not depressed. Risky behaviour includes the increased number of lifetime sex partners, having sex with the injection drug users, having sex while intoxicated. Psychiatric patients with the depressive disorders who are substance abusers are said to be at the higher risk for HIV infection than are the psychiatric patients with another diagnosis. HIV infection increases with the risk of depression. While depressive symptoms may also appear as a reaction to a new diagnosis of the HIV infection, there is also evidence that advancing the HIV infection increases the depression directly. A proposed mechanism of the interrelationship between the HIV infection and the MDD might be a decrease in the cobalamin in the brain which is associated with the HIV infection, which further increases the risk of MDD. This is also associated with the suppression of the natural killer cells and CD8 T cells, thereby worsening the HIV infection. Another suggested mechanism is that the HIV infection increases the risk of depression and psychiatric issues by reducing the serotonergic transmission in the brain.",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW.

The weakness develops in the intensive care unit and is without another obvious cause. ICU-AW is because of critical illness polyneuropathy or critical illness myopathy or a combination of these two, termed critical illness poly-neuromyopathy. Previously used terms such as steroid denervation myopathy, sepsis-induced myopathy and ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction have all been abandoned in preference of ICU-AW.\nThe risk factors for developing ICU-AW are numerous, including patient demographics, premorbid status, drug use in ICU and severity of the disease. The pathophysiology is initiated by an inflammatory response leading to microvascular, muscle and nerve dysfunction or a combination of these factors. The clinical gold standard is the Medical Research Council sum score (MRC-SS) of less than 48 points out of a maximum 60 points. Other modalities used for confirming diagnosis include electromyography, nerve conduction studies and imaging such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nerve and muscle biopsies are rarely performed to confirm the cause of ICU-AW. An integral part in the management of ICU-AW includes limiting or avoiding risk factors, aggressively treating the underlying illness, glycaemic control and early physical rehabilitation. ICU-AW contributes significantly to the development of chronic critical illness and post-intensive care syndrome which affects quality of life of ICU survivors.",

We investigated whether ROP, mild or severe, is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in extremely preterm children. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in southern Taiwan. A total of 394 children &amp;#x3c;28 weeks of gestation who survived to discharge from 2011 to 2018 received neurodevelopmental assessment at corrected age of 24 months. Severe ROP was defined as ROP of stages 2 plus or worse, or recipients of retinal therapy, and mild ROP as stage 1 or 2 in at least one eye. NDI was defined as cognitive or motor impairment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, moderate to severe cerebral palsy, or profound hearing loss. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among the 374 children validated for analysis, 157 children (42%) had non-ROP, 145 (39%) mild ROP, and 72 (19%) severe ROP. As ROP severity increased progressively from non-ROP, to mild ROP, and to severe ROP, the rates of NDI increased from 25%, to 46%, and to 61%. The multivariable logistic regression showed that the model included three levels of ROP, and neonatal morbidities achieved better overall performance for NDI than the model that included neonatal morbidities alone. Compared with non-ROP, mild ROP and severe ROP had adjusted odds ratios of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.10–3.28) and 2.75 (95% CI: 1.33–5.67) for NDI, respectively. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mild ROP and severe ROP are independent neonatal morbidities associated with NDI.

Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated both multifocal and generalized nerve involvement, with the former predominating (multiple mononeuropathy). Nerve and muscle biopsies from two patients revealed severe axonal degeneration with neurogenic atrophy of muscle. The eosinophilia decreased dramatically with corticosteroid treatment and the neuropathy gradually improved, but all three patients manifested residual neurologic disability 17–22 months after onset.

Cerca de la mitad de ese dolor es neuropatico y refleja lesiones causadas por la infeccion viral, por infecciones oportunistas o por los efectos neurotoxicos de la terapia antirretroviral (ARV). El tratamiento del dolor es complejo, en particular en el contexto de la terapia ARV. Se presenta el caso de un paciente con SIDA con dolor talamico que fue seguido en una unidad de dolor cronico (UDC) durante 12 anos. Caso clinico: Paciente masculino de 55 anos de edad con SIDA (clasificacion CDC C3) y toxoplasmosis cerebral, enviado en 2002 a la UDC con dolor talamico. Se quejaba de dolor grave (escala visual analogica [EVA] 8) en el hemicuerpo derecho con sensacion de entumecimiento, descarga electrica y alteracion de la sensacion termica. La prescripcion inicial fue la siguiente: gabapentina 1.600 mg/dia, amitriptilina 50 mg/dia y tramadol de liberacion prolongada (LP) 100 mg 2/dia. Un ano mas tarde el empeoramiento del dolor llevo al aumento de las dosis. En marzo de 2007 se anadio baclofeno. Meses mas tarde, debido a una disfuncion renal, se hicieron cambios terapeuticos. En 2012 se anadieron clonazepam y mirtazapina. El paciente permanecio tan solo con dolor suave, lo que permitio la reduccion de las dosis. Murio en el ano 2014. Discusion: El dolor cronico en pacientes con VIH/SIDA puede ser grave e incapacitante, y su tratamiento es dificil, ya que estan implicados varios mecanismos. La terapeutica ARV aumenta el riesgo de interacciones y de toxicidad farmacologica. Cabe destacar la inhibicion del CYP3A4 y del CYP2D6 por ritonavir, que aumenta las concentraciones plasmaticas y la toxicidad de los farmacos metabolizados por el mismo mecanismo. EnglishIntroduction: Pain in HIV/AIDS patients may have diverse mechanisms. Nearly half of the pain is neuropathic, reflecting injury from viral infection, opportunistic agents, or neurotoxic effects of antiretroviral therapy. Patient treatment is complex, particularly in the setting of antiretroviral therapy. We report the case of an AIDS patient with thalamic pain, followed in a chronic pain unit for 12 years. Case report: A 55-year-old male with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis, sent to the chronic pain unit with thalamic pain (2002). He complained of severe pain (VAS 8) in the right hemibody with numbness, electric discharge, and altered thermal sensibility. Initial prescription was: gabapentin 1,600 mg/day, amitriptyline 50 mg/d paracetamol 1 g tid y AINEs en SOS. to cerebral toxoplasmosis]/AIDS patientay, and tramadol 100 mg twice daily. One year later, pain worsening lead to dose increase. In March 2007 we added baclofen to the prescription. Months later, due to renal lesion, it was necessary to change the therapeutic scheme. In 2012 we add clonazepam and mirtazapine. Pain control allowed dose reductions. The patient died in 2014. Discussion: Chronic pain in HIV-infected patients can be severe and disabling. Treatment is difficult as multiple mechanisms are involved. Antiretroviral therapy poses the risk of pharmacological interactions and drug toxicity. We emphasize ritonavir inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, increasing plasmatic concentrations and toxicity of drugs metabolized by the same way.",

      "abstract": "Kleine–Levin syndrome is a rare disease (1–2 cases per million inhabitants) characterised by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia with accompanying hyperphagia, hypersexuality and behavioural abnormalities such as aggression, irritability and disorientation. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, after ruling out other causes of hypersomnia. There are no lesions in brain imaging studies while EEG demonstrates slowing of bioelectrical activity in some cases. Kleine–Levin syndrome has a self-limiting course with symptoms becoming milder over time until they disappear completely. The pathogenesis includes hypothalamic pathology or autoimmune background (association with certain human leukocyte antigens). This article presents a young patient with a typical clinical picture of Kleine–Levin syndrome. Due to its rare occurrence, the knowledge about this disease entity is not common – the correct diagnosis was made a year after the onset of first symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Les crises psychogènes non épileptiques (CPNE) sont définies comme des changements brutaux et paroxystiques du comportement moteur, des sensations ou de la conscience qui ressemblent à des crises épileptiques. Ces crises sont en rapport avec des processus psychogènes complexes et non avec une décharge neuronale excessive. Les CPNE sont une pathologie fréquente, coûteuse et grave dont l’incidence équivaut à celle de la sclérose en plaques. Pourtant, cette pathologie reste peu et mal connue des psychiatres. Beaucoup d’entre nous pensent que ces crises ont disparu après Charcot. En effet, actuellement, ces patients sont adressés aux neurologues. Un quart des patients vus par un épileptologue souffrent de CPNE. L’étiopathogénie est multifactorielle, comprenant des facteurs pédisposants, des facteurs déclenchants et des facteurs de maintien. Deux mécanismes principaux apparaissent : une prédisposition neurobiologique et des facteurs traumatiques inducteurs de processus dissociatif. Les modèles récents placent la dysrégulation émotionnelle au centre de la problématique. L’imagerie fonctionnelle a mis en évidence des anomalies fonctionnelles entre les aires cérébrales impliquées dans les émotions et les aires motrices. Il existe aussi des perturbations des 3 composantes émotionnelles : sur le plan cognitif avec une alexithymie chez 85 % des patients et des biais attentionnels pour les stimuli négatifs ; sur le plan comportemental avec une réponse d’évitement et sur le plan physiologique avec des taux de cortisol basal augmentés et une diminution de l’arythmie sinusale. Nous exposerons les résultats de notre étude comparative prospective inédite qui compare la réponse électrodermale à des stimuli visuels entre un groupe de patientes CPNE et de témoins sains appariés. Nous avons mis en évidence des perturbations de la réponse neuro-végétative avec une hyporéceptivité aux stimuli plaisants et une corrélation négative entre la propension à la dissociation et l’amplitude de la réponse électrodermale. Ces résultats ouvrent des perspectives en termes de compréhension des mécanismes mais aussi en termes diagnostique et thérapeutique pour développer des outils psychothérapiques de rééducation émotionnelle chez les patients souffrant de CPNE.",

Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness.

      "title": "Encefalopatia septyczna a majaczenie stanu ciężkiego",
      "abstract": "ABSTRAKT Wstęp: Encefalopatia septyczna (sepsis-associated encephalo­pathy – SAE) jest ostrym zaburzeniem funkcjonowania ośrodkowego układu nerwowego (OUN), które pojawia się w następstwie infekcji ogólnoustrojowej, jednak bez infekcji samego mózgu. Celem niniejszego opracowania było przedstawienie encefalopatii septycznej jako jednostki chorobowej, z uwzględnieniem danych epidemiologicznych, diagnostycznych i patofizjologii oraz możliwości leczenia.Stan ten charakteryzuje się szerokim spektrum zaburzeń świadomości od majaczenia aż do śpiączki oraz możliwością wystąpienia drgawek czy ogniskowych objawów neurologicznych. U podłoża encefalopatii septycznej leży wiele mechanizmów patofizjologicznych, takich jak zmiany zapalne czy zaburzenia regulacji przepływu mózgowego. Niezwykle istotne są inter­akcje pomiędzy krążącymi cytokinami zapalnymi a acetylocholiną, co prowadzi do zaburzeń przekaźnictwa cholinergicznego i obumierania neuronów. Dodatkowo interakcja pomiędzy acetylocholiną a cytokinami zapalnymi może indukować stan immunosupresji. Rozpoznanie SAE jest ściśle kliniczne, stawiane na podstawie badania neurologicznego i wykluczenia innych przyczyn, ponieważ nie istnieją zdefiniowane testy biochemiczne czy badania obrazowe specyficzne dla tego schorzenia. Zastosowanie metod rozpoznawania majaczenia na oddziałach intensywnej terapii (OIT), takich jak CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit), pozwala na wcześniejsze wykrycie zaburzeń mózgowych. Badania neuroobrazowe (tomografia komputerowa, obrazowanie metodą rezonansu magnetycznego mózgowia), jak również elektroencefalografia mogą być pomocne w ocenie ciężkości zaburzeń. Najważniejszym elementem leczenia jest wczesne rozpoznanie sepsy, zwłaszcza poprzez stosowanie skali QuickSOFA, oraz wczesne wdrożenie wielokierunkowego leczenia sepsy zgodnie z wytycznymi Surviving Sepsis Campaign, co obejmuje przede wszystkim: wczesną identyfikację i kontrolę źródła zakażenia, wdrożenie optymalnej antybiotykoterapii, prowadzenie adekwatnej płynoterapii i podtrzymanie funkcji poszczególnych narządów. Sposobem zapobiegania zaburzeniom OUN na OIT jest unikanie głębokiej sedacji oraz unikanie benzodiazepin na korzyść deksmedetomidyny i propofolu. W postępowaniu farmakologicznym podczas leczenia majaczenia zalecane jest stosowanie typowych (haloperidol) i atypowych (kwetiapina) leków przeciwpsychotycznych. Metody niefarmakologiczne obejmują wczesne uruchomienie pacjentów, zapewnienie cyklu dzień–noc, minimalizację bodźców w godzinach nocnych (światło, dźwięki, interwencje) oraz zaangażowanie rodziny do opieki nad chorym. Podsumowanie: Encefalopatia septyczna jest zaburzeniem obarczonym ciężkimi powikłaniami, takimi jak zwiększona śmiertelność, długoterminowe zaburzenia poznawcze czy postępująca immunosupresja. Wzajemna zależność pomiędzy encefalopatią septyczną a wieloma narządami obwodowymi i układem odpornościowym powinna znaleźć odzwierciedlenie w podejściu do leczenia sepsy.",

The recognition of pellagra as an endemic disease in the US dates from Searcy’s report in 1907 (Strandell et al., 1989) describing 88 cases of dementia in the Mount Vernon, Alabama Insane Asylum. Extensive knowledge about the course of pellagra has since been obtained and this disease has been eradicated as a public health problem; however, exact relationships between niacin deficiency and specific lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) remain poorly defined. Other nutritional deficiencies, common among patients in mental hospitals and in those with senility (Gregory, 1955; Hersov, 1955; McIlwain, 1966), undoubtedly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and exacerbate neurological problems associated with niacin deficiency. Mental symptoms associated with niacin deficiency often precede the dermatitis and other effects of this nutritional deficiency, suggesting a special sensitivity of the nervous system. If initial mental disturbances are not remedied by administration of nicotinic acid or tryptophan, from which nicotinic acid is synthesized in vivo, permanent structural changes occur in cerebral tissue.",

Confusion about its legitimacy began with its initial recognition in the mid-19th century, followed by modern attempts to establish its criteria in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). There are no distinct clinical features of CPTH. Most resemble tension-type headache, but symptoms of migraine and, rarely, of other primary headaches may occur. CPTH is often associated with the post-concussion/post-traumatic stress syndrome. Anatomic, physiologic, psychologic, socioeconomic, and cultural factors may contribute to the development of CPTH. Changes in diffusion tensor imaging, a refinement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been correlated with subtle cognitive abnormalities in neuropsychologic tests of patients after mild traumatic brain injury. These studies and others may prove to be biologic markers for headache and other symptoms of the post-concussion syndrome. The therapy of CPTH is similar to that of the phenotypically primary headaches. Avoidance of analgesic overuse, prophylactic medications, and, in particular, non-pharmacologic modalities are the basic elements. Active participation by patients in headache management and an empathetic physician are essential.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to cognitive impairment and emotional changes. However, the precise mechanism underlying the crosstalk between the kidneys and the nervous system is not fully understood. Inflammation and cerebrovascular disease can influence the development of depression in CKD. CKD is one of the strongest risk factors for cognitive impairment. Moreover, cognitive impairment occurs in CKD as patients experience the dysregulation of several brain functional domains due to damage caused to multiple cortical regions and to subcortical modulatory neurons. The differences in structural brain changes between CKD and non-CKD dementia may be attributable to the different mechanisms that occur in CKD. The kidney and brain have similar anatomical vascular systems, which may be susceptible to traditional risk factors. Vascular factors are assumed to be involved in the development of cognitive impairment in patients with CKD. Vascular injury induces white matter lesions, silent infarction, and microbleeds. Uremic toxins may also be directly related to cognitive impairment in CKD. Many uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate, are likely to have an impact on the central nervous system. Further studies are required to identify therapeutic targets to prevent changes in the brain in patients with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Dengue has spread to new geographic areas affecting both children and adults, and it has become a global threat. Dengue with central nervous system involvement includes febrile seizures, encephalopathy, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, intracranial hemorrhages, intracranial thrombosis, subdural effusions, mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. These manifestations may be associated with co-infections, co-morbidities, or complications of prolonged shock. It is important to consider dengue as a cause for the above neurological presentations, particularly in endemic territories for dengue disease.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Hashimoto’s encephalopathy is a rare condition, classifiable as an autoimmune non-paraneoplastic encephalopathy. Euthyroid patients can also suffer from this disease. It shows no response to thyroid replacement therapy, but immunosuppressive therapy has proved to be very efficient in treating this disease. Two types of clinical presentation may be observed, the first being characterized by acute onset with focal neurological deficits and epileptic seizures, and the second by non-specific, subacute symptoms such as cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, myocloni, and tremor. This paper reports the case of a 63-year old woman referred to a neurologist after being diagnosed with instability while walking, forgetfulness, hand tremor, and headache. Routine laboratory tests and CSF examination showed no abnormalities. Infectious etiology, neurodegenerative and systemic connective tissue diseases were excluded. Paraneoplastic and tumour markers were negative. After eight days, the patient experienced cognitive deterioration, motor dysphasia, ideomotor apraxia, myoclonic jerks of hands with a grand mal epileptic seizure. Antiepileptic treatment was started. Laboratory tests showed normal levels of T3, T4 and TSH with increased levels of anti-TPO and anti-hTG antibodies. Based on these results and AST screening tests (Apraxia Screen of Tulia), the patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s encephalopathy. Daily treatment was started, with 5 plasmapheresis procedures and corticosteroid therapy. Due to good clinical response, the patient was soon discharged. After two months, due to relapse and the development of tremor, ataxia, dysmetria, and myoclonic jerks, pulse corticosteroid therapy was applied. The patient was discharged home with Medrol oral therapy from which she developed Cushingoid appearance without diabetes or osteoporosis. 18 months later, she developed hypothyroidism and was recommended levothyroxine treatment by an endocrinologist. Presently, neurological assessment is normal. The patient regularly checks up with a neurologist and an endocrinologist. This case report seeks to emphasize consideration of Hashimoto’s encephalopathy as a part of differential diagnosis in patients who exhibit atypical neuropsychiatric symptoms, while infectious, paraneoplastic or immune causes of encephalopathy are excluded. Due to the etiology of the disease and side effects of therapy, a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosis and treatment is needed.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (gestosis) and eclampsia, as well as the acute intranatal hypoxy often act as trigger for the development of the perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. That is accompanied by such typical structural changes as periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and intraventricular hemorrhages (IVH). The hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period can have such consequences as hydrocephaly, microcephaly, infantile cerebral paralysis (ICP), epilepsy and motormental retardation. It is not always possible to determine the disease gravity and forecast of the disease by routine methods of clinical, instrumental and laboratory examination. As it is proved, that the perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is always accompanied by the disruption of Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) permeability for neuron-specific proteins (NSP). NSP can be considered as markers of this pathologic process. Nowadays there are more or less details on 120 NSP, namely, non-enzyme neurospecific Са+ -binding proteins; non-enzyme NSP, responsible for adhesion and intercellular recognition processes; соntractile and cytoskeletal nervous tissue proteins; secreted regulatory and transport NSP; myeline proteins and glial NSP. To evaluate BBB status it is expedient to select from the variety of known NSP most studied proteins, being neurons’ and astrocytes’ markers. Such NSP are gliofibrillary acid protein, GFAP and neuronspecific enolase, NSE. In normal conditions the NSP are within BBB and can be almost undeterminable in the blood serum. In case of the BBB permeability disruption NSP penetrate to the peripheral blood flow and can be determined. The dynamic determination of the NSP in the blood serum can be expedient to evaluate the BBB resistance, to determine the degree of the CNS injury and the disease state forecast at children with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.",

      "abstract": "The (ever) prevalence of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) can vary widely depending on the definition used. We determined the prevalence of NPSLE in 1000 Faces of Lupus, a large multicenter Canadian cohort.Adults enrolled at 10 sites who satisfied the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were included. NPSLE was defined as (i) NPSLE by ACR classification criteria (seizures or psychosis), (ii) ACR, SLEDAI (seizure, psychosis, organic brain syndrome, cranial nerve disorder, headache, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA)), SLAM (CVA, seizure, cortical dysfunction, and headache), and SLICC (cognitive impairment, psychosis, seizures, CVA, cranial or peripheral neuropathy, and transverse myelitis) with and (iii) without minor nonspecific NPSLE manifestations (including mild depression, mild cognitive impairment, and electromyogram-negative neuropathies), and (iv) by ACR and SLEDAI neuropsychiatric (NP) indexes alone. Factors associated with NPSLE were explored using regression models.Cohort size was 1253, with mean disease 12 ± 10 years, mean age 41 ± 16 years, and 86% female. Subgroup size was dependent on the specific definition of NPSLE. Prevalence of NPSLE was 6.4% in group (i), n = 1253 (n = 80); 38.6% in group (ii), n = 681(n = 263); 28.7% in group (iii), n = 586 (n = 168); and 10.2% in group (iv), n = 1125 (n = 115). In univariate analysis, Aboriginals had a nearly 2-fold increase in frequency of NPSLE in all groups. Education level and income were not associated with NPSLE (P = 0.32 and 0.03, respectively). As well, number of ACR criteria, SLAM, age at diagnosis, disease duration, and gender were not associated with NPSLE. Anti-Ro was significantly associated in groups (i) and (iv) and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) were increased in groups (i), (ii), and (iii); however, this lost significance when thromboembolic events were excluded from SLICC, SLEDAI, and SLAM indexes. In group (iv), absence of anti-Sm was significant. In multivariate analysis, anti-Ro and aPL (i) and anti-Ro+ and lack of anti-Sm (iv) were significant. NPSLE was not increased in those with +anti-DNA, La, or ribonucleoprotein (RNP), lupus anticoagulant (LAC), or anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody.The prevalence and factors associated with NPSLE varied depending on the definition used, was highest in Aboriginals, and may be higher if +anti-Ro or aPL are present. SLAM and SLICC include mild subjective disease manifestations, which contributed to a 10% higher prevalence of NPSLE compared to a more strict definition. NPSLE may be less in this database than other publications as its overall prevalence may be decreasing, or because of selection bias inherent to those who enter an observational cohort. NPSLE was associated with aPL and often anti-Ro and varied by ethnicity.",

      "title": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: recognition and approaches to care",
      "abstract": "Abstract The term “developmental and epileptic encephalopathy” (DEE) refers to when cognitive functions are influenced by both seizure and interictal epileptiform activity and the neurobiological process behind the epilepsy. Many DEEs are related to gene variants and the onset is typically during early childhood. In this setting, neurocognition, whilst not improved by seizure control, may benefit from some precision therapies. In patients with non‐progressive diseases with cognitive impairment and co‐existing epilepsy, in whom the epileptiform activity does not affect or has minimal effect on function, the term “developmental encephalopathy” (DE) can be used. In contrast, for those patients with direct impact on cognition due to epileptic or epileptiform activity, the term “epileptic encephalopathy” (EE) is preferred, as most can revert to their normal or near normal baseline cognitive state with appropriate intervention. These children need aggressive treatment. Clinicians must tailor care towards individual needs and realistic expectations for each affected person; those with DE are unlikely to gain from aggressive antiseizure medication whilst those with EE will gain. Patients with DEE might benefit from a precision medicine approach in order to reduce the overall burden of epilepsy.",

It is characterized by excessive, purposeless movements that are distressing, irregularly timed, and randomly distributed. Chorea can be present in many diseases, such as hereditary, metabolic disturbance, drug-induced, and functional disorders, and, rarely, genetic, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that leads to ineffective clonal hematopoiesis, fibrous tissue deposits in the bone marrow, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and splenomegaly. In rare cases, following uncertain pathological mechanisms, it can present with chorea, particularly affecting the limbs, head, and orofaciolingual muscles. We present a case of a male patient with evolving PMF over several years who was admitted for progressive cognitive impairment and generalized involuntary movement disorder. We also present a review of all cases of myeloproliferative disorders presenting with chorea published in the last 40 years.",

      "abstract": "Background: Cognitive dysfunction is not infrequent after recovery from SARS-Cov-2 infection and often accompanied by fatigue and several of the other symptoms seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Post-Covid Syndrome (PCS) inflammation impairs mental function through a combination of altered attention and cognition. Here we discuss the relationship between infection, peripheral and central inflammation, and cerebral and cognitive dysfunction in patients with PCS. Methods: Review of the relevant literature and personal clinical research work. Results: Cognitive dysfunction in PCS is multifactorial and has several similarities to that in ME/CFS. It likely arises from low grade persistent inflammation associated with sleep dysfunction and altered mood with endothelial dysfunction leading to altered regional cerebral blood flow and accompanied by disturbed neuronal function. Immune dysregulation initiated by reactivation of previously acquired herpes type viruses and leading to reduced mitochondrial energy generation and subtle autoimmunity targeting one or more neuronal and autonomic receptors may also be contributing factors. Treatments used in ME/CFS, and aimed at these factors, used collectively may provide benefit. Conclusion: Reducing low grade systemic inflammation, viral reactivation and immune dysregulation has the potential to improve cognitive dysfunction in PCS.",

      "abstract": "Demyelinating diseases cause destruction of the myelin sheath, while axons are relatively spared. Pathologically, demyelination can be the result of an inflammatory process, viral infection, acquired metabolic derangement and ischemic insult. Three diseases that can cause inflammatory demyelination of the CNS are: Multiple sclerosis (MS), Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Acute hemorrhagic leucoencephalitis. Differentiation is not always easy and there is considerable overlaping. Data about adults with acute demyelination requiring ICU admission is limited. A 17 year old Greek female was hospitalised in the ICU because of acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. She had a history of febrile disease one month before, acute onset of paraplegia, diplopia, progressive arm weakness and dyspnea. Her consciousness was not impaired. A demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease, possibly post infectious encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was the underlying condition. The MRI of the brain disclosed diffused expanded cerebral lesions involving the optic nerve, basal ganglia cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata. There was also extended involvement of the cervical and thoracic part of the spinal cord. CSF leukocyte count was elevated with lymphocyte predominance. The patient required mechanical ventilation for two months. Then she was transferred to a rehabilitation centre. Three years later she remains paraplegic. Since then she has not suffered any other demyelination attack. Demyelinating diseases can cause acute respiratory failure when the spinal cord is affected. Severe forms of these diseases, making necessary ICU admission, is less frequently reported. Intensivists should be aware of the features of these rare diseases.",

      "title": "Issues of diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment refers to frequent disorders in the elderly and senile, and their prevalence increases with age significantly. Non-dementia cognitive disorders mean a spectrum of changes in the cognitive sphere that precede the development of dementia over the course of many months and even years. Mild forms of cognitive impairment (MCI) are the most studied type of pre-dementia conditions, which in most cases represent a prodromal stage of disorders progressing over time to a dementia syndrome. Early identification of individuals with MCI is important because timely diagnosis of these disorders is expanding the potential impact of the secondary prevention and therapeutic intervention, which can delay or even prevent the onset of professional and social maladaptation due to development of dementia. The article considers the historical issues of studying these disorders, presents the modern principles of their classification and diagnostic criteria. A clinical observation of a patient with a polyfunctional non-amnestic type MCI syndrome is provided. The features of cognitive disorders typical for chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, such as mental retardation, impaired activity arrangement, difficulties with generalisation in relative preservation of memory and orientation in combination with emotional and affective disorders are described. The authors discuss issues of treatment of MCI syndrome, which should be comprehensive and include the correction of all vascular risk factors, non-drug (regular physical activity, cognitive training) and pharmacological treatments aimed at improving cognitive performance. The article describes the possibilities of modern neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy of cognitive impairment, showing the role of choline alfoscerate in the treatment of MCI.",

      "abstract": "Seizures resulting from cerebral autoimmunity are either acutely symptomatic in the context of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) with neural surface antibodies, or they are indicative of an enduring predisposition to seizures, that is, epilepsy. Here, we propose a practical definition for autoimmune encephalitis-associated epilepsy (AEAE): Seizures associated with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase, paraneoplastic syndromes, or Rasmussen encephalitis are classified as AEAE. AEAE secondary to AIE with antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1, contactin-associated protein-2, or γ-aminobutyric acid-B receptor can be diagnosed if the following criteria are met: seizures persist for at least 2 years after immunotherapy initiation; no signs of encephalitis on magnetic resonance imaging and no fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography hypermetabolism; normal cerebrospinal fluid cell count; and a substantial decrease in antibody titers. This classification corresponds to different disease mechanisms. While AIE results from the pathogenic effects of neural antibodies, AEAE is probably the consequence of encephalitis-related tissue damage and thereby mainly structurally mediated. The distinction between AIE and AEAE also has practical consequences: In AIE, immunotherapy is usually highly beneficial, whereas anti-seizure medication has little effect. In AEAE, immunotherapy is less promising and the usual anti-seizure interventions are preferable. In addition, the diagnosis of AEAE has social consequences in terms of driving and professional limitations.",

      "title": "Psychiatric aspects of infections",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychiatric disturbances stemming from infectious diseases are widespread in both the industrialized world and developing countries. Such neuropsychiatric syndromes are not necessarily the result of infectious processes directly involving the central nervous system, they may also be complications of systemic infections. There are many microbial, viral, and parasitic agents, as well as other types of infectious substances, which can affect the central nervous system, leading to the appearance of neurological and psychiatric symptoms that may cause suffering to the patient, and even be disabling. When considering the psychiatric manifestations of infectious illness, it is important to consider clinical manifestations derived from a possible systemic infection, which can be less obvious than a direct involvement of the central nervous system. Acute organic reactions may accompany many systemic infections, especially at the extremes of life. A clear example is the delirium that frequently occurs with pneumonia in the elderly. In these clinical syndromes, several factors could be responsible for the alterations in cerebral metabolism. The mere fact of having a fever could be involved. Cerebral anoxia often appears to be responsible, or the influence of toxins derived from the infecting micro-organism. More complex metabolic disturbances or the accumulation of toxic intermediate products can also be -implicated. Likewise, infections that course as chronic or subacute illnesses are frequently accompanied by the onset of depressive syndromes. One of the factors implied in clinical depression that occurs within the context of systemic infectious illnesses (e.g. tuberculosis and infectious mononucleosis), is a sense of physical vulnerability, possibly heightened by a loss of strength and negative changes in the patient's appearance. Patients are often afraid of losing their earning capacity or even their jobs, as well as other social and occupational problems associated with the illness. Another very important factor, above all with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted disease (STD), is the social stigma that these patients may suffer. Sexually transmitted disease infection implies sexual activity that historically carries connotations of illicit, casual, sexual encounters, and acquiring an STD is frequently associated with embarrassment and social stigma. In addition to the disease itself, the medications commonly used to treat infectious illnesses can have side-effects that alter patients’ behaviour, as well as their cognitive and affective functioning (Table 5.3.5.1). In this chapter we consider infections of clinical interest in the practice of psychiatry. These conditions will be dealt with briefly, and textbooks of general medicine should be consulted for further details. Prion diseases and chronic fatigue syndromes, which are also related to the subject of the present chapter, are discussed in Chapters 4.1.4 and 5.2.7, respectively.",

Epidemic forms of encephalitis can be seasonal, with peak occurrence from June to September. In addition, an immunosuppressed state, including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, requires specific attention because it places the patient in a predetermined category of differential diagnosis and outcome. Autoimmune encephalitis may have the same prevalence as infectious encephalitis, but there are more immunocompromised associated encephalitides in developed countries. This chapter discusses the most pertinent therapeutic targets in the management of acute encephalitis. The treatment of acute viral encephalitis is the major focus, but autoimmune encephalitis is now more common. Several clinical neurologic conditions can closely mimic viral encephalitis and are discussed.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Preexisting mental illness leads to worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19. The presence of the virus was reported in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue post-mortem. Most common psychiatric manifestations include delirium, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder. \"Long-COVID\" non-syndromal presentations include \"brain-fogginess,\" autonomic instability, fatigue, and insomnia. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger prior vulnerabilities based on the priming of microglia and other cells, induced or perpetuated by aging and mental and physical illnesses. COVID-19 could further induce priming of neuroimmunological substrates leading to exacerbated immune response and autoimmunity targeting structures in the central nervous system (CNS), in response to minor immune activating environmental exposures, including stress, minor infections, allergens, pollutants, and traumatic brain injury.",

All of the clinical studies show poor cognitive performance during migraine attacks, though, the interictal data are conflicting. Migraineurs show impaired cognitive function interictally in most of the clinic-based studies. Population-based studies did not reveal a difference in cognitive functions between migraineurs and controls. The specific cognitive domains involved are information processing speed, basic attention, executive functions, verbal and non-verbal memory and verbal skills. Neurophysiological, imaging and pharmacological studies support clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment in migraine. Longitudinal studies do not suggest progressive cognitive decline over time in migraine patients. Preventive medications and comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety can impact cognitive function, but cannot fully explain the cognitive impairment in migraine. In contrast to migraine, tension type or cluster headache are not associated with cognitive impairment, at least during headache-free periods.",

Besides the metabolic and nutritional conditions, etiology has already been clarified in poliomyelitis, epidemic encephalitis, cerebral or spinal syphilis as well as in encephalomyelitis following epidemic or tuberculous meningitis, vaccination and various infections, and in ascending myelitis by peripheral neuritis. Most of encephalomyelitis, however, remains yet of unknown etiology. They have usually diverse manifestations. Most of them show the symptoms of transverse myelitis, while some show those of disseminated encephalomyelitis and some complicate optic neuritis, resembling multiple sclerosis or Devic disease. Though discussions have been repeated concerning the problem that they should belong to a clinical entity or not, the inclusive term of \" non-specific encephalomyelitis \" seems to be given to these, diseases of quite unknown etiology. Recently not few patients were reported in Japan, who had been noticed diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms in their prodromal stage and then followed by the myelopathy or encephalomyelopathy. Here, it will be the aim of this symposium to answer the question whether they could be thought to be a independent disease entity or not. First of all, the chairman thought, that it would be important to make inquiries, as to the epidemiology of this disorder in all parts of Japan. Besides our own 371 patients containing 15 autopsied cases, 452 patients containing 9 autopsied were collected through enquête by the speakers and discussers, from the medical school hospitals and other main hospitals of all over Japan.",

However, in the recent past, there has been an increase in the incidence of syphilis, especially with HIV coinfection. Neurosyphilis results from an untreated primary syphilis. Neuropsychiatric disorder appears to be the commonest manifestation followed cerebrovascular accident, myelopathy, ocular disease and seizure.

This is especially so because of its similar presentation to other more common clinical conditions. We describe the case of a 39-year-old man displaying acute global aphasia and right-sided facial weakness in keeping with a left middle cerebral artery infarct. This was confirmed with computed tomography of the brain, and subsequently, further investigations revealed a diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

      "title": "Moyamoya disease presenting as thalamic infarction in a patient with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder",
      "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system typically involving optic nerves and spinal cord. With the discovery of the disease-specific aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody and the improvement of understanding of clinical and imaging patterns of brain involvement in what is now termed neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).1 The diagnosis of NMOSD is mainly based on the positive AQP4 antibody and the presence of at least one of the core clinical characteristics associated with optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema, other brainstem, diencephalic, or cerebral presentations.2 Moyamoya disease (MMD), which was first reported by Japanese scholars Suzuki and Takaku in 1969, is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by bilateral progressive stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and its main branches with emergence of coexisting abnormal net-like vessels.3, 4 MMD is particularly common in Asian countries, especially in Japan. Cerebral ischemia and intracranial hemorrhage are two major hazards of the disease. The exact etiology and pathogenesis of MMD remain largely unknown.5 However, the coexistence with immunological diseases has been found among patients with MMD in recent reports.6 But there are few reports of patients with both diseases. Here, we describe the presence of MMD in a patient with NMOSD, suggesting autoimmunity may play a role in the occurrence and development of MMD. A 43-year-old female was admitted to our hospital complaining of numbness in the left limb for one week. Past medical history was notable for the diagnosis of NMO and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient was diagnosed with NMO ten years ago due to repeated episodes of blurred vision and numbness and weakness in the limbs. Brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at that time indicated lesions in the brain white matter as well as spinal cord involving cervical and thoracic regions. AQP4 antibody test was not performed. Considering the potential diagnosis of demyelinating disease, steroid pulse therapy was initiated and the patient improved after the treatment. After discharge, corticosteroid was gradually tapered and the patient was maintained at a low-dose corticosteroid and azathioprine in the long term. The patient was also diagnosed with left basal ganglia hemorrhage three years ago, presenting as right-sided hemiplegia and confusion. Brain angiography was not performed at that time, and the patient recovered after symptomatic treatment. Family members exhibited no sign of the case pathology. Upon examination, the patient appeared lethargic and sluggish, with normal vital signs. Visual acuity was impaired in the right eye with a score of 20/200 on testing. Pupils were 3 mm bilaterally, round and reactive. Regarding motor function, muscle strength was decreased in the left extremities (Medical Research Council strength score, grade 3). Hypoesthesia of the left side was also observed. Babinski sign was present bilaterally. Further investigations revealed a positive AQP4 antibody in the serum, with an elevated titer of 1:32. An initial diagnosis of NMOSD was made considering her medical history and radiological findings. Other tests including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, serum glucose, and anti-nuclear antibodies were all normal. Brain MRI after admission indicated lesions with restricted diffusion in the right thalamus and hemosiderin deposition in the left basal ganglia (Figure 1). Unexpectedly, brain magnetic resonance angiography revealed severe stenosis of bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, as well as stenosis of the right posterior artery and the intracranial segment of the right internal carotid artery. Radiological findings, as a result, strongly suggested the diagnosis of MMD. Digital subtraction angiography further confirmed this diagnosis with findings of bilateral occlusion of distal internal carotid arteries and rich collaterals near the skull base (Figure 2). After antiplatelet and other symptomatic therapies, the patient improved. She refused further treatment with vascular reconstruction surgery and received physical therapy at a local rehabilitation center. The patient was diagnosed with brain infarction due to her clinical history (numbness and weakness of the left limb with an acute onset) and imaging findings (lesions with restricted diffusion on brain MRI). The underlying cause for the ischemic episode and the previous hemorrhagic event three years ago, as suggested by the angiographic findings this time, turned out to be MMD. Thorough investigations failed to yield any other cardiovascular risk factors, further corroborating the causative role of MMD. In addition, according to the 2015 diagnostic criteria,2 the patient also had concomitant NMOSD based on the recurrent episodes of blurred vision and limb weakness, radiographic lesions spanning the brain and spinal cord as well as a positive AQP4 antibody. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder is a humoral immunity-mediated autoimmune disease, where AQP4 antibodies play a major role in-between. AQP4 antibodies induce the infiltration of brain tissues by inflammatory cells through the activation of classic complement pathway, which further damages the astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons.7 By contrast, the pathophysiological mechanisms of MMD remain elusive. The development of MMD is a result of interplay between genetic, inflammatory, and autoimmune factors.6 Patients with MMD were reported to show positivity of several autoantibodies or concomitantly have other autoimmune diseases including Grave’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and type 1 diabetes.5, 6 Our patient with AQP4-positive NMOSD further supports the role of autoimmune factors in MMD. The long-standing NMOSD in this patient might accelerate the development of MMD and led to the ischemic event this time. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and MMD rarely exist concomitantly in one patient. To our knowledge, this is the third report of patients with both diagnoses. The previous two patients with simultaneous NMOSD and MMD were both Asian females.8, 9 In fact, the two diseases share similar epidemiological features, with Asians and females more likely affected.5, 10 Genetic factors, therefore, may also explain the coexistence of the two diagnoses to some extent. However, the exact pathogenesis underlying the co-occurrence of NMOSD and MMD remains unknown. More cases are needed to further elucidate this relationship in-between. The authors declare no conflict of interest.",

The patient was referred to rehabilitation for an evaluation of progressive weakness involving all four limbs. A subsequent nerve conduction study and needle electromyography identified motor axonal neuropathy. At that time, laboratory studies specific to the differential diagnosis of motor axonal neuropathy were performed; however, the abnormality noted was a decreased CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count. Motor axonal neuropathy represents an uncommon manifestation of idiopathic CD4(+) T-lymphocytopenia and is probably associated with an underlying immune process.",

Most patients present with a change in consciousness level and may have fever, seizures, movement disorder or focal neurological deficits. Diagnosis hinges crucially on lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, but imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) may also be helpful. Treatment of HSV encephalitis with aciclovir dramatically improves outcome, but the optimal management of autoimmune encephalitis is still uncertain. Many patients with encephalitis are left with residual physical or neuropsychological deficits which require long-term multidisciplinary management. Here we review assessment of patients with suspected encephalitis, general aspects of management and areas of ongoing research.",

Several syndromes are reviewed, including relatively mild and typically short-lived reactions (sickness behavior), severe acute conditions (delirium), post-acute syndromes (post-intensive care syndrome, post-viral syndromes), and encephalitis lethargica. Sickness behavior is a short-lived immunologically mediated reaction. Delirium is associated with severe, life-threatening disease. Post-intensive care syndrome arises, in part, from the effects of mechanical ventilation. Encephalitis lethargica was an enigmatic condition of unknown etiology that formed the world’s first neuropsychiatric pandemic. Persistent post-viral syndromes include Long COVID. Various etiological factors are likely involved in infection-related psychopathology, including brain inflammatory (immunological) reactions. Methods for managing these clinical conditions are discussed.",

Greater‐than‐age‐expected cognitive decline differentiates MCI from normal aging and the absence of marked functional decline in carrying out daily responsibilities distinguishes MCI from dementia. Heart‐healthy lifestyle practices focused on preventing or optimizing management of medical conditions associated with dementia risk, engagement in mentally stimulating activities, and memory training interventions have all been associated with cognitive benefits in MCI. Multicomponent behavioral interventions may be particularly advantageous due to the complexity of disease processes potentially underpinning the condition. Research demonstrating negative impacts of MCI on close family indicates family interventions are also important to managing cognitive change due to MCI.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HIV distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP); toxic neuropathies, with emphasis on the antiretroviral (ARV)-associated neuropathies; and other neuropathies found in HIV-infected individuals. Subjects were classified as having asymptomatic DSP if they only had neurologic signs or as having symptomatic DSP if they also had paresthesias or pain in a study by Schifitto and coworkers. The study showed that use of these drugs was not a significant risk factor for incident symptomatic DSP. Such an effect may be related to preservation of immune function, forestalling the potential occurrence of neurotoxicity. This study also addressed the important issue of whether the presence of asymptomatic DSP is a risk factor for incident symptomatic DSP. Thus, it is not surprising that patients with advanced HIV infection and severe immunosuppression remain at the greatest risk of neurotoxicity due to ARV agents. The incidence, severity, progression, and reversibility of peripheral neuropathy from zalcitabine (ddC), as with other toxic neuropathies, are dose dependent. Unlike other toxic neuropathies, dapsone-induced peripheral neuropathy involves primarily motor nerves. Mononeuropathy multiplex (MM) is an infrequent manifestation of HIV infection. A reduced number of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus have also been described, although the clinical significance of this is unclear. It has been suggested that the pathophysiological mechanism may be due to HIV infection itself as well as an autoimmune mechanism. It may arise from HIV itself or from medications used to treat HIV infection and other concomitant infections.",

There are some relatively frequent patterns of involvement; e. g. facial and other cranial nerve palsies in the uveo-parotid syndrome, and within the central nervous system, granulomatous infiltration of the meninges at the base of the brain and in the adjacent hypothalamus causing neuro-endocrine and visual disturbances. But any part of the nervous system may be affected, and the great variety of possible combinations of pathological changes can give rise to bizarre clinical features.

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been increasingly accepted as a major external risk factor for neurodegenerative morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence indicates that the resultant chronic neurobiological sequelae following head trauma may, at least in part, contribute to a pathologically distinct disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The clinical manifestation of CTE is variable, but the symptoms of this progressive disease include impaired memory and cognition, affective disorders (i.e., impulsivity, aggression, depression, suicidality, etc.), and diminished motor control. Notably, mounting evidence suggests that the pathology contributing to CTE may be caused by repetitive exposure to subconcussive hits to the head, even in those with no history of a clinically evident head injury. Given the millions of athletes and military personnel with potential exposure to repetitive subconcussive insults and TBI, CTE represents an important public health issue. However, the incidence rates and pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown, primarily due to the fact that there is no in vivo diagnostic tool. The primary objective of this manuscript is to address this limitation and discuss potential neuroimaging modalities that may be capable of diagnosing CTE in vivo through the detection of tau and other known pathological features. Additionally, we will discuss the challenges of TBI research, outline the known pathology of CTE (with an emphasis on Tau), review current neuroimaging modalities to assess the potential routes for in vivo diagnosis, and discuss the future directions of CTE research.",

The most common clinical syndromes of AIE are disorders of the psyche, behavior, cognitive and autonomic functions, movement disorders, as well as epileptic seizures. The diagnosis of AIE can be complicated by the isolated presentation of psychopathological hallucinatory-delusional and emotional-affective symptoms, which can imitate the onset of an idiopathic mental disorder and requires a certain alertness and increased attention to the anamnesis data and assessment of the neurological status. The MRI pattern of limbic encephalitis with unilateral or bilateral involvement of the medial temporal lobes is typical for AIE, however, both normal MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord and involvement of various brain regions in different subtypes of AIE are possible. It is necessary to consider the possibility of not only a recurrent course of AIE, but also the possibility of the overlapping syndromes of AIE and other autoimmune disorders development, including demyelinating diseases – multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or diseases associated with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, which requires longer observation due to the risk of relapse of autoimmune diseases.",

The article discusses pathogenetic and clinical variants, approaches to the diagnosis of VCIs, and provides their modern classification. The features of CI, typical for chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, are described, such as a slowdown in the rate of mental activity and disorders of frontal executive functions in combination with behavioral and emotional disorders. The issues of treatment of VCI are discussed, which should be comprehensive and include correction of the underlying vascular disease, non-drug (regular physical activity, smoking cessation, cognitive training) and drug treatments aimed at improving cognitive functions. The possibilities of modern neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy of CI, including the use of Cellex®, are shown.",

      "abstract": "Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), is the most common cause of severe sporadic encephalitis worldwide. HSE is occasionally accompanied by the recurrence of clinical symptoms that usually occur a few weeks following the initial infection. According to recent studies, the recurrence can be due to a secondary autoimmune mechanism rather than the virus invasion. One of the most common etiologies for autoimmunity is Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor encephalitis. This disorder is a treatable autoimmune encephalitis manifesting as movement disorder or neuropsychological involvement.The article pertains to the presentation of an 18-month-old infant with a primary diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis who was re-admitted to the hospital shortly after discharge with restlessness, speech disorder, and abnormal movements. The movements were predominantly choreiform and disappeared during sleep. Brain MRI revealed abnormal predominance in the left temporoparietal regions with encephalomalacic changes in some areas in favor of sequella of previous encephalitis in addition to recent right temporal involvement of sequella of previous encephalitis. The polymerase chain reaction test of cerebrospinal fluid for herpes simplex infection was negative. Therefore, the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis was raised. More laboratory examinations revealed that the Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antibody level was significantly elevated in cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the diagnosis of Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor encephalitis was established.Relapsing symptoms after herpes simplex virus encephalitis, especially with movement disorders, should raise a high clinical suspicion of Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor encephalitis in children. Therefore, clinicians should be cautious of its occurrence in infants; despite its rarity in that age group.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Distinct from Chapter 24, on co-occurring psychiatric disorders, this chapter addresses common physical comorbidities that give rise to chronic pain and are notorious for associated substance use disorders. The concept of “pseudo-addiction” is explored as one of several contributors to common misperceptions of the analgesic needs of such patients. Examples of entities discussed are chronic low back pain, sleep apnea, chronic pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and HIV infection or AIDS-related pain. While not intrinsically painful, sleep apnea merits inclusion as it arises in conjunction with sedative-hypnotic, opioid, or nicotine use. Cirrhosis likewise creates obstacles to successful pain or addiction management resulting from altered metabolism of medications and enhanced susceptibility to potentially lethal syndromes (hepato-renal syndrome, gastric hemorrhage, etc.). The management of neuropathic pain in HIV infection (Chapter 15) is amplified here.",

      "title": "VASCULAR PARKINSONISM IN AN ELDERLY WOMAN WITH MIXED CRYOGLOBULINEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATITIS C INFECTION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rarely reported in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).1 Stroke, transient ischemia, lacunar infarction, or encephalopathic syndrome may occur. Mechanisms related to vasculitis induced by the mixed cryoglobulinemia frequently associated with HCV infection seem to generate neurological lesions.1, 2 Vascular parkinsonism (VP) is now recognized as a distinct clinicopathological entity,3, 4 especially in older people,5 although the validity of VP as a concept has been called into question since the original work of Critchley.6 VP accounts for 3% to 6% of all cases of parkinsonism in studies in which imaging or pathological analysis is used to support diagnosis.7 We report here a case of VP associated with mixed HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. An 83-year-old woman was hospitalized for rehabilitation after a gradual loss of autonomy related to gait problems, postural instability, and mild depression, all of which worsened after an episode of severe bronchopneumonia. Parkinson's disease had been diagnosed 6 years previously, but no improvement was observed on levodopa treatment. Four years after the onset of symptoms, the patient was admitted to a neurological facility. Magnetic resonance imaging showed microhypersignal for the basal ganglia (striatum, insula, thalamus), external capsule, periventricular white matter, and, to a lesser extent, geniculate bodies, cerebellar peduncles, and dentate nuclei. VP was diagnosed. The dose of levodopa was increased, but no real improvement followed. The patient had been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (Stage 6 of the Knodell classification based on liver biopsy) 10 years earlier. She had refused treatment and was reluctant to attend follow-up visits. One year before admission, biochemical markers (Fibrotest and Actitest) indicated severe fibrosis (A3-A4) and necroinflammatory activity (A3). Polymerase chain reaction tests showed that the patient was infected with HCV of genotype 1. The patient again refused treatment. She had a long history of hypertension more or less controlled by treatment. A consultant neurologist reexamined and found gait problems, postural instability with retropulsion, hypertonia involving all four limbs but most severe in the legs, and an absence of rest tremor. The neurologist reported generalized apraxia, no real cognitive impairment, and a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 29 of 30. She confirmed the diagnosis of VP. Cryoglobulinemia (type III) was detected. This is the first description of a case of VP associated with mixed HCV-related cryoglobulinemia. A causal effect is possible in this case. Disease of the small arteries and arterioles that penetrate the brain cortex and reach the underlying structures of the white and deep gray matter, such as the basal ganglia, are the primary cause of approximately one third of symptomatic strokes.8 Arteriolosclerosis probably affected these small vessels in our patient, who, like most patients with VP, had hypertension,3-5 but because few patients with hypertension develop parkinsonism, another determinant must also have been involved. We suspect that cryoglobulinemia may have played a role by increasing the burden on these small vessels affected by arteriolosclerosis. A previous study found9 that 40% of patients with VP had anticardiolipin antibodies (ACLA), which are associated with hypercoagulable states and stroke risk, but found no difference in vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, between ACLA-positive and -negative patients. Thus, as proposed in previous studies1, 3-5, 9 we suggest that a more-precise definition of the relationship between diseases of the small vessels in the brain and other conditions, such as HCV infection, is required. In particular, it would appear to be worthwhile to test patients with VP for HCV infection and cryoglobulinemia. Financial Disclosure: None.

      "title": "Autoimmune and paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Extract Key points ... Introduction Acute or subacute autonomic failure can be caused by certain drugs and toxins or in association with systemic disorders that affect the nerves more diffusely (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis). Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

Neurological complications due to hypertension are frequently hyperdiagnosed in Russian neurological practice. Thus, headache, dizziness, impaired recall of recent events, nocturnal sleep disorders, and many other complaints in a hypertensive patient are usually regarded as a manifestation of dyscirculatory encephalopathy. At the same time headaches (tension headache and migraine) in hypertensive patients are predominantly primary; headache associated with dramatic marked elevations in blood pressure is encountered in only a small number of patients. The role of cerebrovascular diseases in the development of dizziness in hypertensive patients is also overestimated. The vast majority of cases, patients with this complaint are in fact identified to have benign paroxysmal postural vertigo, Mеniеre’s disease, vestibular neuronitis, or vestibular migraine. Psychogenic disorders or multisensory insufficiency are generally responsible for non-systemic vertigo in hypertensive patients. Chronic cerebral circulatory insufficiency may cause non-systemic vertigo as a subjective equivalent of postural instability. Cognitive impairments (CIs) are the most common and earliest manifestation of cerebrovascular lesion in hypertension. In most cases, CIs in hypertension were vascular and associated with cerebrovascular lesion due to lacunar infarcts and leukoaraiosis. However, mixed CIs frequently occur when hypertensive patients are also found to have signs of a degenerative disease, most commonly in Alzheimer’s disease.",

With the increasing prevalence of dengue infection in endemic regions, post-infectious neurological complications following dengue infection are now been reported more frequently. We report a patient who developed multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction blocks following dengue infection during the immediate post-infectious period. MMN is a rare neurological disorder with an autoimmune etiology and to best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of MMN occurring following dengue infection as a post dengue neurological complication. A 20 year old Sri Lankan male who was treated for serologically confirmed dengue infection presented to us with 1 month history of bilateral hand weakness which has started 5 days after the dengue infection (5 days after the discharge). On examination he had asymmetrical motor weakness of the hands and to a lesser degree in feet. There was no sensory impairment. Nerve conduction studies confirmed MMN with conduction blocks. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for which he showed a good response. The authors report the first case of MMN complicating dengue fever in a previously healthy male from Sri Lanka. Thus it should be borne in mind that although rare, MMN can occur as a post-infectious complication of dengue fever.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion. Uno de los debates nosologicos mas controvertidos en el ambito de la Neuropsiquiatria versa sobre el diagnostico diferencial entre psicosis adquiridas e idiopaticas”(esquizofrenia) en pacientes que previamente han sufrido un traumatismo craneoencefalico (TCE). Caso clinico. Se expone el caso de un varon de 15 anos, sin antecedentes psiquiatricos personales ni familiares, que a los 5 meses de sufrir un TCE con perdida de conciencia desarrollo un sindrome psicotico cronico caracterizado por sintomatologia positiva, siendo esta resistente a todos los tratamientos psicofarmacologicos prescritos. No se evidencio lesion cerebral focalizada a traves de neuroimagen estructural. Discusion. El TCE puede actuar como agente etiopatogenico primario (psicosis debida a un TCE) o precipitante (esquizofrenia) en los cuadros psicoticos manifestados. Los dos criterios externos que contribuyen en mayor medida a la distincion de ambos trastornos son la escasa sintomatologia negativa y la baja vulnerabilidad genetica entre las personas con psicosis debida a un TCE. Con relativa frecuencia, tanto el periodo de latencia TCE-psicosis como los correlatos neurocognitivos y neurobiologicos asociados apenas permiten esclarecer el estatus nosologico del sindrome psicotico. Son necesarios ensayos clinicos controlados para valorar la eficacia de los antipsicoticos en aquellos sujetos con psicosis debida a un TCE.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric manifestations are commonly observed in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. In particular, neurological involvement is known to be more common in patients with positive anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulants. Nevertheless, cerebellar ataxia has rarely been reported, especially as the first clinical manifestation of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebral vascular infarction or ischemia, vasogenic oedema and antibody-mediated cerebral vasculopathy or vasculitic process have been supposed as possible aetiologies of acute cerebellar ataxia related to SLE. We report the clinical and radiological features of a 38 years old diabetic lady who developed a rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome as first sign of SLE; no other cause explaining her cerebellar ataxia was found. Imaging of brain in this patient revealed prominent cerebellar atrophy. She was treated with initial pulse intravenous methylprednisolone later oral prednisolone and oral mycophenolate mofetil. There was no further progression of her neurological signs after the initiation of therapy. The appearance of a cerebellar syndrome with unknown aetiology with associated features of possible systemic autoimmune dysfunction, should be taken into account in clinical practice for appropriate diagnostic workup in order to provide effective therapeutic options.",

      "abstract": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) usually progresses insidiously with lower motor neuron-type weakness, minimal or no sensory symptoms. Diagnostic criteria include motor conduction block (CB) at sites not exposed to compression or entrapment. CBs may persist or reverse irrespective of clinical outcome. Acute onset with generalized weakness is uncommon. We report four patients who presented acutely areflexia, pure motor deficits without sensory disturbances, multifocal CBs persisting at the same motor nerves on serial electrophysiological studies. Three patients had preceding infections; two showed IgM reactivity against the ganglioside GM1. Intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIg) improved or stabilized symptoms. Patients 2,3,4 receive maintenance therapy with IVIg for years. Acute-onset MMN (AMMN) should be differentiated from other immune-mediated neuropathies such as acute inflammatory polyneuropathy either demyelinating (AIDP) or axonal (AMAN), acute motor conduction block neuropathy (AMCBN), acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The correct diagnosis deserves implications for patient long-term treatment and prognosis. Moreover, the authors address the problem of defining the spectrum of MMN particularly in the acute setting.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular weakness in critically ill has been increasingly reported in the recent years. Occasionally it may lead to difficulty in weaning the patients from mechanical ventilation, which is difficult to diagnose clinically. Though in well-planned studies the incidence has been reported to be high, the diagnosis is often missed due to the presence of various confounding factors in the form of drug effects, underlying disorder and coexisting abnormalities of the central nervous system. A high index of suspicion with detailed neurological and electrophysiological examination is required for an early and accurate diagnosis. A wide spectrum of disorders and drugs can be responsible for the critical illness neuromuscular abnormality. The most frequent and defined disorders include; critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) which is characterized by a sensorimotor reversible polyneuropathy presenting as distal symmetrical weakness with loss of deep tendon reflexes. Acute myopathy is another important disorder in this group which usually presents with quadriplegia often related to steroid use. Persistent blockade of neuromuscular junction is also defined in critically ill patients. It is, therefore, important to understand these disorders and their implications in the management of these patients. Some of the conditions require prolonged neuro-rehabilitation. The various acquired disorders leading to neuromuscular abnormalities in critical care, and their diagnosis and management are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the progress in medicine post operative cognitive deficiency (POCD) remains an important clinical problem. Since the introduction of cardiac surgery there have been frequent reports of its adverse neurological outcomes. Recent technological advances have contributed to a lesser occurrence of clinically evident complications such as coma, stroke, epilepsy or blindness. This brought to attention a more common yet occult disorder--POCD. The above malady mostly concerns memory and executive functions. POCD has a negative impact on the quality of life and labor market attachment, however it's relation to mortality seems to be most disturbing. Prevalence of POCD is mainly associated with microembolisms, hipoperfusion and inflammatory reaction of the central nervous system following cardiac surgery. In addition many studies have shown the importance ofbiochemical disorders, cerebral oedema and the influence of comorbidities in the development of POCD. In the light of available evidence, there is no substantial difference between the cognitive outcomes of various types of cardiac surgery. Recent studies show that POCD in this clinical setting is mostly mild and transient. There are, however, patients who suffer from persisting POCD. Modern medicine has not developed standards for treatment of this complication. Setting up methods for prevention, detection and treatment of POCD should be the concern of both physicians and researchers in the following years.",

      "title": "Predementia neurocognitive impairment in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Cognitive decline is one of the main manifestations of brain damage especially in the elderly. In some cases, cognitive dysfunction stayed within normal aging and do not lead to social dis-adaptation, while in other cases severe cognitive impairment develops when daily activity and domestic independence is affected. However, these disturbances are preceded by prolonged intermediate stage, when cognitive deficit do not reach the degree of dementia, but already do not match normal aging. Initial terms (for example benign senescent forgetfulness) were interpreted as aging phenomena. Later this state named as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered as prodromal phase of demented disease. Up to date studies allow us consider MCI as an integral part of the complex structure of overlapping syndromes ('pre-cognitive impairment'), the allocation of which have not only theoretical, but also pragmatic meaning, allow us, on the one hand, to plan clinical trials series with various therapeutic targets, and, on the other hand, to form rational approach to the modern management of patients with MCI and pre-MCI in clinical practice.Нарушения нейрокогнитивных функций – одно из основных проявлений поражения головного мозга, особенно часто развивающееся в пожилом возрасте. У значительной части пожилых лиц закономерные ('возрастные') изменения когнитивных функций не выходят за рамки возрастной нормы и не приводят к социальной дезадаптации, тогда как в других случаях нарастает когнитивный дефицит, в результате которого человек утрачивает трудоспособность, а затем и бытовую независимость, что принято обозначать как деменция. Однако слабоумие не развивается мгновенно - ему предшествует более или менее длительный переходный период, в течение которого когнитивные нарушения уже выходят из границ возрастной нормы, но еще не достигают степени, которую обычно ассоциируют с понятием деменции. Тем не менее именно появление признаков деменции в течение длительного времени служило критерием основных заболеваний, преимущественно проявляющихся когнитивными нарушениями. Необходимость их более ранней диагностики привела к концепции 'умеренного когнитивного расстройства' (УКР). Проведенные к настоящему времени исследования позволяют рассматривать УКР как составную часть сложной структуры перекрывающихся синдромов ('преддементных когнитивных нарушений'), выделение которых может иметь не только теоретическое, но и сугубо прагматическое значение, позволяя, с одной стороны, спланировать серию клинических испытаний с различными терапевтическими мишенями, а, с другой - выстроить рациональные подходы к ведению больных в клинической практике.",

      "abstract": "Le encefalopatie mitocondriali sono un gruppo eterogeneo di malattie, in parte ancora in corso di definizione, per cui è sempre necessaria una conferma biochimica. Alcune malattie mitocondriali, come i difetti della β- ossidazione degli acidi grassi, possono causare gravi squilibri metabolici con ipoglicemia e coma che si ripercuotono in modo aspecifico sul sistema nervoso centrale determinando quadri di sofferenza cerebrale diffusa. Altre malattie mitocondriali determinano danni più specifici sul SNC. Nella prima infanzia la malattia più caratteristica è la malattia di Leigh, che determina alterazioni principalmente nel tegmento pontino e mesencefalico e nei nuclei della base. Alcuni casi presentano lesioni caratteristiche nei nuclei subtalamici, altri presentano reperti più aspecifici e diffusi simili a quadri di leucodistrofia. In età più tardiva (seconda infanzia o età adulta) la malattia più interessante dal punto di vista neuroradiologico è il MELAS, che presenta lesioni cortico-sottocorticali nelle regioni posteriori con distribuzione non tipicamente vascolare, sopra e sottotentoriali, che tuttavia possono essere ricondotte ai territori più distali dei vasi. Calcificazioni nei nuclei della base sono presenti in circa la metà dei casi. Un'altra encefalopatia mitocondriale dell'età giovanile o adulta è la sindrome di Kearns-Sayre, in cui la RM può dimostrare alterazioni nel tronco, nei talami, nei nuclei della base e nella sostanza bianca sottocorticale. Alterazioni nel neostriato possono essere osservate nelle sindromi distoniche associate ad atrofia ottica di Leber. Non sono descritte invece lesioni specifiche nel MERRF, in cui atrofia ed alterazioni della sostanza bianca sono state occasionalmente osservate. Esistono infine casi che presentano quadri clinici e neuroradiologici intermedi tra le varie sindromi mitocondriali. L'obiettivo di questa revisione è dimostrare alcuni aspetti tipici delle sindromi più comuni e indicare quali aspetti neuroradiologici, a volte inattesi, devono suggerire l'ipotesi di encefalopatia mitocondriale, permettendo cosi di indirizzare in modo corretto ulteriori indagini diagnostiche.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a potentially treatable form of dementia and progressive gait impairment where symptoms are believed to be caused by the subcortical disruption of white matter tracts. Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is frequently co–morbid in iNPH, differences in affected brain tissue may result in differing neuropsychologic presentations. To contrast neuropsychological impairment between iNPH patients and matched non–NPH control subjects (normal, MCI or AD). Within 13 years, 279 iNPH patients were evaluated at the NYU Silberstein Aging–and–Dementia Research Center. iNPH was diagnosed if patients exhibited sulcal disproportionate ventriculomegaly on CT/MRI and a prominent dyspraxic gait disorder without alternative neurologic explanation. Neither cognitive status nor incontinence was considered in making the diagnosis. Controls included research subjects with neither a gait disorder nor hydrocephalic ventriculomegaly who received diagnoses of either normal, MCI or AD. All iNPH patients underwent a neuropsychologic test battery (see table) before shunt surgery. Cases were excluded for impaired English language competency, a Global Deterioration Score (GDS) > 4, or education < 12 years. iNPH cases were paired with control subjects using a matching algorithm that first ensured exact correspondence for gender, GDS and Functional Assessment Staging score, and then minimized differences in age and years of education. Univariate analyses of variance were conducted with WAIS vocabulary score as a covariate to adjust for potential language and IQ influences. Most iNPH cases exhibited global cognitive impairment (60.4% dementia, 31.8% MCI). No significant group differences were observed for age (mean = 74.2yrs) or education (mean = 15.3yrs). Significant mean neuropsychologic differences were observed only for Digit–Symbol Substitution, Perceptual Speed, Digit–Span Backward, Finger–Tapping Speed, and Trail–Making Part B (see table). To our knowledge, this is the first large scale study investigating neuropsychologic function in iNPH. The findings indicate that, relative to controls, iNPH patients exhibit neuropsychological deficits in selective attention, executive function, concentration, and motor functioning, but not in areas of language, constructional praxis, and verbal recent memory. These results support the concept that in iNPH, unlike normal aging or AD, patients exhibit a “subcortical dementia” syndrome with disproportionate deficits on non–cortically mediated tasks.",

We aimed to present clinical and neuropathological features of three cases of pre‐ or post‐mortem polymerase chain reaction confirmed CNS ‐ WD with distinct clinical presentation, outcome and pathological findings. One patient had an acute onset with spinal and brainstem involvement and died without CNS ‐ WD diagnosis after 14 weeks. Neuropathology showed extensive inflammatory and necrotizing lesions with abundant foamy periodic‐acid‐ S chiff ( PAS )+ macrophages. The second patient had a subacute evolution with late CNS ‐ WD diagnosis and death occurring 18 months after onset despite antibiotic treatment. Brain examination showed inflammatory lesions in the brainstem, thalamus and cerebellum, and abundant foamy PAS + macrophages. The third case was diagnosed within 4 weeks of onset and treated with an excellent response. He died after a disease‐free period of 24 months of unrelated causes. Neuropathology showed cystic residual lesions devoid of microorganisms without inflammatory reaction. CNS ‐ WD may have an acute or subacute course with variable response to treatment. Accordingly, subjacent lesions may be those of a severe acute necrotizing encephalitic process or subacute inflammatory lesions involving diencephalic, brainstem, cerebellar and spinal regions. Chronic, cavitary brain lesions may be sequelae of a successful treatment. Early diagnosis should allow appropriate treatment and improve prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by heteroplasmic deletion of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. HNPP typically presents with clinical features such as peroneal nerve palsy or cubital tunnel syndrome, which are caused by mechanical compression. Diagnosing cases where neuropathy is absent at the pressure site can be challenging. This is a case study of an 18-year-old man who underwent surgery on the left side of his neck over 10 years ago to remove lymphadenopathy. Following the surgery, he experienced recurrent weakness but only sought medical attention when muscle weakness persisted for longer than a week postoperatively. Upon admission, the patient exhibited neurological symptoms consistent with C5 neuropathy, mainly affecting the deltoid muscles. No serological abnormalities were found to be associated with neuropathy. Neither magnetic resonance imaging nor computed tomography scans detected any lesions around the C5 nerve root. The posture during sleep was believed to cause excessive extension of the C5 nerve root, leading to the assumption that there was some vulnerability in the nerve. A transient sensory loss in the area innervated by the ulnar nerve prompted us to examine the fluorescence in situ hybridization study on the blood sample, which revealed a deletion of the PMP22 gene. The patient was diagnosed with HNPP and was advised to avoid risky postures. Following the implementation of these lifestyle changes, he did not experience any further weakness in his shoulders.",

We report a case of a 48-year-old female who presented with complaints of shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty walking and speaking, and primarily right unilateral symptoms involving multiple peripheral nerves, the right phrenic nerve, and the facial nerve following a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. She was diagnosed with MADSAM after an extensive physical examination, electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction tests, and laboratory testing. She improved following the initiation of long-term treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the second reported case of MADSAM following a COVID-19 infection. There have been reports of demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems related to COVID-19; however, it remains unclear whether COVID-19 is the causative agent or only a correlative.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

The children are particularly more vulnerable to have this complication. Despite availability of several potent antimalarial drugs in recent past, the mortality status has not changed. A large number of survivors are left with disabling neurological sequelae. Few patients may experience post-malaria neurological syndrome after recovery from complicated falciparum infection. Various psychiatric syndromes have been described either as early manifestation of cerebral malaria or part of post malaria neurological syndrome. From Indian subcontinent several patients of delayed cerebellar ataxia have also been described following recovery from clinical malaria. In paediatric patients, convulsions of cerebral malaria need to be differentiated from febrile convulsions. Falciparum malaria is also associated specifically with convulsions in uncomplicated patients of malaria. Several isolated case reports of various other neurological syndromes like peripheral neuropathies, various movement disorders, myelopathies and stroke like syndrome have been described. However association of these neurological manifestations with malaria remains doubtful.",

      "abstract": "Abstract MCI is a transitional state between the cognitive changes of normal aging and very early dementia. As the field of aging and dementia moves toward early identification of cognitive symptoms, MCI has become an area of active research. Most clinicians believe that neurodegenerative processes evolve over years and perhaps decades. Thus, the concept of an intermediate stage of impairment between normal aging and early dementia needs to be clarified. MCI has evolved to represent this transitional zone (Figure). According to recent research, MCI can be classified into three subtypes: 1) amnestic MCI, in which the person has a memory impairment out of proportion to performance in other cognitive areas; 2) multidomain MCI, in which the person has a slight impairment in several cognitive domains, for example, language, attention, executive function, and visuospatial skills with or without a memory impairment, although these deficits are mild and not sufficient to constitute dementia; and 3) single non-memory domain MCI, in which the person is impaired in a non-memory area in relative isolation to the other cognitive domains.",

      "abstract": "About one-third of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail at least two antidepressant drug trials at 1 year. Together with clinical and experimental evidence indicating that the pathophysiology of MDD is multifactorial, this observation underscores the importance of elucidating mechanisms beyond monoaminergic dysregulation that can contribute to the genesis and persistence of MDD. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mechanistically linked to the presence of neurovascular dysfunction with blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability in selected neurological disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, MDD is frequently comorbid with such neurological disorders and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in disorders characterized by vascular endothelial dysfunction (cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the neurobiology of MDD. More recent evidence links neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to MDD without neurological comorbidity. We review this emerging literature and present a theoretical integration between these abnormalities to those involving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in MDD. We discuss our hypothesis that alterations in endothelial nitric oxide levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling are central mechanistic links in this regard. Understanding the contribution of neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to the pathophysiology of MDD may help to identify novel therapeutic and preventative approaches.",

Vinca alkaloids are the only drugs used in lymphoma which commonly cause neuropathy. Compression or infiltration of nerve roots by lymphoma is a rare presenting feature but becomes more common with advanced disease. Radiation plexopathy does not usually develop until at least 6 months after irradiation and can be difficult to distinguish from neoplastic infiltration. Either multifocal infiltration of nerves or lymphoma-associated vasculitis may present as a peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of Guillain-Barré (GBS) syndrome, and possibly chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, appears to be increased in association with lymphoma, especially Hodgkin's disease. Subacute sensory neuronopathy and subacute lower motor neuronopathy have both been reported as paraneoplastic syndromes associated with Hodgkin's disease.

Notably, accommodative excess due to ocular MG is rare, but may occur with exotropia, with or without diplopia. We report 2 cases of ocular MG: First, a 32-year-old man with exotropia, bilateral hypometric and slowed adducting saccades with dissociated abducting nystagmus, miosis, and decreased distance vision in his right eye; second, a 45-year-old man with similar ocular motor deficits, miosis, and myopia. Both patients showed ocular motor deficits which appeared to localize to the pons but were instead due to ocular MG. Ocular MG should be considered in patients who present with reduced visual acuities due to any disruption in accommodation. Any ocular motor deficit, even if appearing to be centrally mediated or occurring without ptosis, may be caused by ocular MG.",

      "abstract": "Vaccination is the most important medical success of the 20th century, having resulted in saving more lives than any other medical intervention. The contraindications for vaccination are discussed in children with neurological disorders and diseases which were present before or occurred after vaccination. General contraindications for vaccination in these children do not differ from contraindications in the general pediatric population. Special contraindications refer to particular vaccines. Non-progressive encephalopathies caused by early perinatal brain damage (cerebral palsy), well controlled epilepsies, congenital neuromuscular diseases and the majority of metabolic diseases as well as developmental pervasive disorders, acute encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis and Guillian Bareov syndrome in later childhood – are not contraindications for vaccination. Vaccination is often hampered by „pseudo-contraindications“ such as mild febrile illness, antibiotic therapy, prematurity, „low“ weight, recent exposure to infection or allergy to penicillin. These informal contraindications should be avoided in the best interests of the child. Mild and moderate local or general reactions after previous vaccination are not contraindications for further vaccination. Our experience showed that side effects after acellular vaccine against Diphtheria- Tetanus – Pertussis (DTaP), which is now used in our country too, are less frequent. Progressive acute and subacute infectious, metabolic or immunological encephalo-pathies or encephalomyelopathies, coma, prolonged unconscious state with EEG and cerebro-spinal fluid changes, infantile spasms and Rey’s syndrome are absolute contraindications for vaccination against Pertussis. The children with encephalopathy temporarily related to vaccination against Pertussis as well as children with anaphylactic reaction after vaccination should not be vaccinated against Pertussis. The children who developed aseptic meningitis after MPR vaccination (against Morbilli, Mumps and Rubeolla) should be revaccinated. In the group of 43 children who had perinatal neurological difficulties and were sent to the neuropediatrician in the first three months of life, 56 % of them were vaccinated during the following month after consultation.",

      "title": "Potential of Nano-Antioxidants and Nanomedicine for Recovery from Neurological Disorders Linked to Long COVID Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Long-term neurological complications, persisting in patients who cannot fully recover several months after severe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, are referred to as neurological sequelae of the long COVID syndrome. Among the numerous clinical post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, neurological and psychiatric manifestations comprise prolonged fatigue, \"brain fog\", memory deficits, headache, ageusia, anosmia, myalgias, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and depression lasting several months. Considering that neurons are highly vulnerable to inflammatory and oxidative stress damages following the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuroinflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested to dominate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the long COVID syndrome. It is emphasized that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress damages are crucial for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, antioxidant therapies have the potential to slow down and prevent disease progression. However, many antioxidant compounds display low bioavailability, instability, and transport to targeted tissues, limiting their clinical applications. Various nanocarrier types, e.g., liposomes, cubosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, micelles, dendrimers, carbon-based nanostructures, nanoceria, and other inorganic nanoparticles, can be employed to enhance antioxidant bioavailability. Here, we highlight the potential of phytochemical antioxidants and other neuroprotective agents (curcumin, quercetin, vitamins C, E and D, melatonin, rosmarinic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and Ginkgo Biloba derivatives) in therapeutic strategies for neuroregeneration. A particular focus is given to the beneficial role of nanoparticle-mediated drug-delivery systems in addressing the challenges of antioxidants for managing and preventing neurological disorders as factors of long COVID sequelae.",

      "title": "Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 Disease and Post Covid Syndrome: The Role of N Acetyl-cysteine and Acetyl-L-carnitine",
      "abstract": "COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as anosmia, anxiety, depression, stress-related reactions, and psychoses. The illness can cause persistent cognitive impairment and \"brain fog\", suggesting chronic brain involvement. Clinical entities of ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and Post COVID Syndrome (PCS) mainly present neuropsychiatric symptoms such as dysgeusia, headache, fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related brain damage is unclear, but it is linked to various mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, impaired glutamate homeostasis, glial and glymphatic damage, and hippocampal degeneration. Noteworthy is that the metabotropic receptor mGluR2 was discovered as a mechanism of internalisation of SARS-CoV-2 in Central Nervous System (CNS) cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) are two supplements that have already been found effective in treating psychiatric conditions. Furthermore, NAC showed evidence in relieving cognitive symptomatology in PCS, and ALC was found effective in treating depressive symptomatology of PCS. The overlapping effects on the glutamatergic system of ALC and NAC could help treat COVID-19 psychiatric symptoms and PCS, acting through different mechanisms on the xc-mGluR2 network, with potentially synergistic effects on chronic pain and neuro-astrocyte protection. This paper aims to summarise the current evidence on the potential therapeutic role of NAC and ALC, providing an overview of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology. It proposes a pathophysiological model explaining the effectiveness of NAC and ALC in treating COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

Particularly the hypoactive subtype of delirium represents a diagnostic and clinical challenge. As symptoms of hypoactive delirium may overlap with the clinical picture present in dementia and depression, correct diagnostic differentiation can be challenging. In the absence of timely diagnosis and treatment, hypoactive delirium can last for several weeks. Apart from the health consequences for the patient, such a long course can stress caregivers and the family to their very limit. In this article, we will address the particularities of hypoactive delirium in hospital practice, the neurobiological bases of this disorder, the challenges it represents at the diagnostic level as well as its recommended management according to current literature.L’état confusionnel aigu (ECA) correspond à une altération aiguë de l’attention et de la conscience ainsi que de la cognition. L’ECA hypoactif représente un défi pour l’équipe médico-soignante en ce qui concerne le diagnostic et la prise en charge. Par ailleurs, les symptômes de l’ECA hypoactif se recoupent le plus souvent avec ceux de la démence et la dépression, ce qui peut mener à une erreur diagnostique. Lorsqu’il se prolonge (plusieurs semaines), l’ECA hypoactif met les soignants et la famille du patient en grande difficulté. Dans cet article vont être abordés les particularités de l’ECA hypoactif dans la pratique en milieu hospitalier, ses bases neurobiologiques, les défis qu’il représente au niveau diagnostique ainsi que sa prise en charge selon les dernières données de la littérature.",

      "abstract": "Introduction HIV infection is a chronic disease characterized by a great deal of uncertainty and unpredictability, being anxiety disorders a frequent psychiatric problem. Objective To provide an overview of anxiety in HIV-infected patients. Methods Literature review based on PubMed/Medline, using the keywords “HIV” and “anxiety disorders”. Results HIV-infected individuals can experience symptoms of anxiety across the spectrum of anxiety disorders. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood is the most common diagnosis, followed by generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Some patients present with these disorders prior to notification, others develop them during the course of their illness, mainly at key moments. In HIV-infected patients, anxiety can be a manifestation of side effects of medication; a symptom of an illness associated with HIV disease; or, most commonly, the psychological response to the stressors of the illness. In fact, many issues are responsible for the anxiety experienced by people living with HIV. The authors will analyze them. Besides the distress of anxiety disorders, these lead to a decrease in adherence to antiretroviral treatments, resulting in adverse progression of HIV disease and increased risk of mortality. Importantly, however, appropriate psychiatric intervention can do it over. Conclusions Careful diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders in the context of HIV disease is even important, given the serious effects if untreated. Thus, anxiety should never be seen simply as a natural reaction to a life-threatening illness. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

The general features of neuromuscular AEs have not been elucidated because the frequency is generally low, ranging from 1-2%of cancer patients undergoing ICIs therapy. The diseases affect the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscle. Disease onset and progression may be rapid with a critical clinical course. The clinical presentation may be different from that of patients unrelated to drugs. Headache, dizziness, and dysgeusia were relatively common and mild treatment-related AEs. In contrast, representative immune-related AEs such as autoimmune encephalitis, demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia, and myositis were serious. There was a tight association between myasthenia, myositis, and myocarditis. There are guidelines for the treatment of neuromuscular immune-mediated AEs. For all but the minimum neurological symptoms, checkpoint inhibitor therapy should be withheld until the nature of the AEs is defined. Immune-modulating medication is generally effective for neuromuscular AEs. Both CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular AEs. Correct understanding of neuromuscular AEs is required for the best management of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Methamphetamine (METH) can cause multiple physical and psychological harms. Psychosis is one of the most serious health consequences from using METH, with this requiring aggressive treatment and being associated neurocognitive impairment and structural brain abnormalities. While the majority of METH-associated psychosis are brief (METH-associated brief psychosis, MBP); the psychosis can become persistent for &amp;gt;1 month in a subset of people (METH-associated persistent psychosis, MPP), with a symptom profile substantially similar to schizophrenia. Blood levels of neurofilament light chain (NFL) have been proposed as a measure of neuroaxonal integrity in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Aims &amp; Objectives We aimed to delineate the neuroaxonal damage linked to METH-associated psychosis, especially its persistent form, and compare it to schizophrenia. Methods We enrolled 135 individuals with METH use disorder (55 with no psychosis [MNP group], 54 with MBP, and 24 with MPP), 78 with schizophrenia, and 85 healthy controls. Blood NFL levels measured by single molecule array (SiMoA) immunoassay. We compared NFL levels between different groups and used regression analyses to identify clinical variables related to NFL levels. Results Individuals with MUD had significantly higher NFL levels compared to controls but comparable to patients with schizophrenia. We found age (p&amp;lt;.01) and duration of METH use (p = 0.01) were positively correlated with NFL levels whereas BMI is negatively correlated with NFL levels. Subsequent group comparisons showed that the NFL levels in MPP group were higher than MBP and MNP group while the levels were comparable between the latter two groups. Interestingly, MPP group had increased NFL levels compared to schizophrenia group. Furthermore, those with a prolonged psychosis associated with METH, i.e. schizophrenia-like, had a even higher NFL levels than all the resting groups. Discussion &amp; Conclusions These results suggest substantial neuroaxonal alterations following METH use, with a longer duration associated with higher injury. In particular, persistent psychosis The pronounced increase of NFL levels in the people with MPP and suffering from persistent psychosis might indicate that dual disruptive effect (from METH use and psychosis) on the neuroaxonal integrity and the pathology could differentiate MPP and schizophrenia.",

The autoimmune process may be triggered by an infection, vaccine, or occult neoplasm. In the latter case, onconeural autoantibodies are directed against intracellular neuronal antigens, but a recent heterogeneous group of encephalitic syndromes has been found not to have underlying tumor but is associated with autoantibodies to the neuronal surface or synaptic antigens. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are very common in autoimmune encephalopathy; as a result, affected children may be initially present to psychiatrists. Neurological features are movement disorders, seizures, altered conscious level, and cognitive regression. Hypoventilation and autonomic features may be an aspect. Inflammatory findings in the cerebrospinal fluid may be present but are relatively nonspecific. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also demonstrate abnormalities that provide clues for diagnosis, particularly on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery or T2-weighted images. AE is well responsive to immune therapy, with prompt diagnosis and treatment strongly beneficial. Patients with paraneoplastic encephalitis are more refractory to treatment compared to those in whom no malignancy is identified.

Clinically, patients present with headache, nausea, meningismus, and photophobia, symptoms that are also common in patients with bacterial meningitis. A stiff neck, with or without a Brudzinski or Kernig sign, may be observed. Patients usually appear nontoxic but may have changes in mental status, including irritability. Other signs of possible viral infection may include pharyngitis, adenopathy, morbilliform rash, and evidence of systemic viral infection, including myalgia, fatigue, and anorexia. There are usually no signs of vascular instability, and the course is often self-limiting. Aseptic meningitis is a syndrome of multiple etiologies, both infectious and noninfectious. The etiologic diagnosis of aseptic meningitis is often complicated by the numerous possible causes and the lack of specific diagnostic tests.",

      "title": "Infection of the Central Nervous System",
      "abstract": "Meningism is the syndrome of the triad of symptoms of headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia caused by irritation of the meninges. While it is often associated with a diagnosis of meningitis, it is also present in other conditions causing meningeal irritation such as subarachnoid haemorrhage, trigeminal neuralgia, migraine, or febrile illness in children. Meningitis is process of inflammation of the meninges, which may or may not be due to an infectious agent. Strictly speaking, it is a pathological diagnosis, but in lieu of the impracticability of biopsying the meninges, surrogate markers are used to infer inflammation. These include raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count and protein; and meningeal enhancement using contrast enhanced MRI or CT of the brain. Encephalitis is process of inflammation of the brain parenchyma. Strictly speaking, it is again a pathological diagnosis, and again surrogate markers are used to infer this inflammation, although it is slightly more difficult due to the protected nature of the brain. CSF white cell count and protein are expected to be elevated and parenchymal inflammation may be seen on contrast enhanced MRI. Meningoencephalitis is a combination of the above with inflammation of both the meninges and the adjoining brain parenchyma. Aseptic meningitis is said to be present when there is meningism and signs of meningeal inflammation on CSF and imaging, but no bacterial cause is found on culture or molecular diagnostics. Viral meningitis is the commonest cause, although post-neurosurgical aseptic meningitis is often chemical in nature. Meningism plus fever are the classic symptoms of meningitis. The onset may be acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the cause. Neck stiffness may range from mild discomfort to an almost rigid neck and is not a sensitive test in young children or elderly. While not used routinely and with low sensitivity particularly in young children and elderly, Kernig’s and Brudkzinski’s signs, both of which stretch the meninges worsening the irritation and increasing pain, have a good positive predictive value. Non-specific signs of intracranial pathology may be present, such as signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), vomiting, reduced level of consciousness, focal neurological signs, seizures, or irritability, especially in the immunocompromised, elderly, and young children who may not have classic signs and symptoms.",

Some of the most commonly reported symptoms affecting QOL in HIV-infected patients are fatigue, pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep disturbances. Fatigue often has a multifactorial etiology, including advanced HIV disease, opportunistic infections, poor nutrition, hormonal insufficiency, and anemia. Pain is one of the most overlooked factors by clinicians. Anxiety/depression and sleep disturbances are experienced by many HIV-infected individuals and are highly correlated with the perception and progression of disease. Although these common clinical symptoms impact QOL in HIV-positive patients, there are no established guidelines for treating them. As pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep disturbances can influence fatigue, as well as each other, the HIV care provider should monitor them closely because their severity reflects the clinical course of HIV as well as the overall well-being of the patient.",

It differs also in increased numbers of PrP positive plaques being present in brain tissue, and not having a characteristic EEG. Multi-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, dentatopallido-luysian atrophy, Huntington's disease, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and motor neurone disease, are slowly progressive degenerations that have focal neurological features of either autonomic failure, failure of voluntary gaze, chorea, cerebellar features, or progressive muscular atrophy with spasticity related to the primary area of involvement. All but the latter tend to have features of parkinsonism in addition. The dementia that accompanies these disorders tends to be of the sub-cortical type. No reliable test allows the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus to be made with certainty, and treatment usually involves a CSF shunt. Spinocerebellar degeneration and familial spastic paraparesis are rare hereditary disorders that may also show a dementia in addition to the more obvious focal neurological signs. Cortico-basal degeneration is somewhat unique in having a presentation with dyspraxia that is often unilateral. Parkinsonism and a subcortical dementia eventually occur. Progressive subcortical gliosis and dementia lacking specific histological features produce a subcortical or frontal dementia respectively.",

      "abstract": "The case is reported of a patient with IgM-kappa paraproteinemia and polyneuropathy (PN) with very slow nerve conduction velocities. The association of demyelinating PN with severely decreased nerve conduction velocities and an IgM-kappa paraprotein usually suggests the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), but less often of clinically manifest macroglobulinemia. Demyelinating PN with IgG-lambda- or IgA-lambda paraproteinemia occurs often in the uncommon but readily treatable osteosclerotic myeloma. A monoclonal protein combined with peripheral neuropathy involving predominant pain, temperature and autonomic loss (small fibre neuropathy) is by and large pathognomonic for primary systemic amyloidosis or amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Mild sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy is an unspecific syndrome found in all gammopathies. It is important to differentiate between paraproteinemia with clinically pure chronic sensory PN and paraneoplastic sensory polyneuropathy. Unlike amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), paraproteinemias associated with a motor neuron disease-like syndrome sometimes evolve unusually slowly and exhibit neurophysiologically subclinical lesions of sensory nerve fibers. Mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy with a monoclonal protein is typical of cryoglobulinemia. Demyelinating PN of osteosclerotic myelomas presenting with one or a small number of bone lesions usually regress after excision or irradiation of the plasma cell proliferations. Immunosuppressants and plasmapheresis in the treatment of the demyelinating IgM-kappa neuropathies, of paraproteinemia with the motor neuron disease-like syndrome, and of mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy with cryoglobulinemia, are of doubtful value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Viral infections are common, well-documented triggers, but the role of bacterial pathogens, particularly Mycoplasma pneumoniae, remains poorly understood. Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been implicated in autoimmune encephalitis previously, but reported cases are rare. This report presents a case of Mycoplasma-induced seronegative autoimmune encephalitis in a previously healthy adult, highlighting the diagnostic challenges and the need for early recognition. The patient, a 37-year-old man with a past medical history of asthma, presented with encephalopathy and confusion following a fall in the shower a few hours previously. He then experienced refractory seizures necessitating intensive immunosuppressive and antimicrobial therapy. After a four-month hospital stay, primarily in the ICU, the patient returned to his baseline and was discharged home after four days without experiencing any new neurological deficits or seizures. Given the potential for delayed diagnosis and severe neurological complications, increased clinical awareness and further research are needed to improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Mycoplasma-associated autoimmune encephalitis.",

Several clinical trials have demonstrated a high correlation between congestive heart failure (CHF) and cognitive impairment. The severity of cognitive impairment correlates positively with the degree of CHF. The underlying mechanism for cognitive impairment remains unclear but appears to be related to cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral reactivity with selective impairment of verbal memory and attention domains. Furthermore, cognitive dysfunction represents one aspect of frailty, a novel concept that encompasses a range of clinical conditions that results in functional impairment in patients with heart failure. In addition, frailty independently predicts mortality in CHF patients. Cognitive impairment is a common and predictable effect of CHF that contributes with social and behavioral problems to decreased compliance to prescribed therapy and increased hospital readmissions. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to deal with the complexity of this clinical syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is defined as difficulties of initiating and maintaining sleep, early awakening and poor subjective sleep quality despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep with impairment of daytime performance. These components of insomnia – namely persistent sleep difficulties despite of adequate sleep opportunity resulting in daytime dysfunction - appear secondary or co-morbid to neurological diseases. Comorbid insomnia originates from neurodegenerative, inflammatory, traumatic or ischemic changes in sleep regulating brainstem and hypothalamic nuclei with consecutive changes of neurotransmitters. Symptoms of neurological disorders (i.e motor deficits), co-morbidities (i.e. pain, depression, anxiety) and some disease-specific pharmaceuticals may cause insomnia and/or other sleep problems. This guideline focuses on insomnias in headaches, neurodegenerative movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, epilepsies, stroke, neuromuscular disease and dementia. The most important new recommendations are: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) is recommended to treat acute and chronic insomnia in headache patients. Insomnia is one of the most frequent sleep complaints in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Patients may benefit from CBTi, antidepressants (trazodone, doxepin), melatonin and gaba-agonists. Insomnia is a frequent precursor of MS symptoms by up to 10 years. CBTi is recommended in patients with MS, traumatic brain injury and. Melatonin may improve insomnia symptoms in children with epilepsies. Patients with insomnia after stroke can be treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists and sedating antidepressants. For patients with dementia suffering from insomnia trazodone, light therapy and physical exercise are recommended.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Neurological involvement is an uncommon complication of Epstein‐Barr virus infection, and the long incubation period may complicate the diagnosis. A 15‐year‐old boy is described with Epstein Barr virus infection complicated by prolonged life‐threatening thrombocytopenia, cranial neuropathy and peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. The abnormal platelet count was unresponsive to multiple‐drug therapy and splenectomy, but normalized 13 months after presentation. Neurological recovery was slow; the patient continues to have a mild peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy three years after the onset of the illness. Infection with Epstein‐Barr virus should be considered in patients with acute neurological problems associated with thrombocytopenia. Measurement of antibodies to individual Epstein‐Barr virus proteins facilitates the diagnosis of Epstein‐Barr virus infection. RÉSUMÉ Neuropalhie crânienne, polyneuropathie et thrombocytopénic dans une infection à virus Epstei‐Barr l'implication neurologique est une complication inhabituelle de l'infection à virus Epstein‐Barr el la longue période d'incubation peut compliquer le diagnostic. l'article décrit un garcon de 15 ans avec une infection à virus Epstein‐Barr compliquée par une thrombocytopénic menaçant la survie, une neuropathie crânienne et une neuropathie périphérique sensori‐motrice. Le taux anortnal de plaquettes ne répondit pas a de multiples médicament et à une splénomégalie, mais se normalisa spontanément 13 mois après le premier examen. La récupération neurologique fut lente; le patient continue à avoir une neuropathie périphérique sensori‐motrice modérée trois ans aprés le début de la maladie. l'infection a virus Epstein‐Barr doit être envisagée chcz les malades avec des problémes neurologiques aigus associés à une thrombocytopénié La mesure d'anticorps vis à vis des protéines du virus Epstein‐Barr facilite le diagnostic d'infection a virus Epstein‐Barr. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Craniate Neuropathie, Polyneuropathie und Thrombozylopenie durch eine Epstein‐Barr Virus Infektion Eine neurologische Beteiligung bei einer Epstein‐Barr Virus Infektion ist eine ungcwöhnliche Komplikation und durch die lange Inkubationszeit kann die Diagnose erschwert werden. Es wird ein 15‐jähriger Junge mit einer Epstein‐Barr Virus Infektion beschrieben, bei dem als Komplikationcn eine prolongierte lebensbedrohliche Thrombozytopenie, craniale Neuropathie und periphere sensomotorische Neuropathie beobachtet wurden. Die abnormc Thrombozytenzahl sprach weder auf verschiedene Medikamente, noch auf die Splenektomic an, normalisierte sich aber nach 13 Monaten. Die neurologische Befundbesserung verlief langsam, der Patient hat noch drei Jahre nach Beginn der Erkrankung eine leichte periphere senso‐motorische Neuropathie. Bei Patienten mit akuten neurologischen Problemen im Zusammenhang mit einer Thrombozytopenie sollte an eine Epstein‐Barr Virus Infektion gedacht werden. Die Antikörperbestimmung zu bestimmien Epstein‐Barr Virus Proteinen ermöglicht die Diagnose einer Epstein‐Barr Virus Infektion. RESUMEN Neuropatia craneal, polineuropalia y trombocitopenia en la infeccion por el virus de Epstein‐Barr La afectación neurologica es una complicación poco corriente en la infección por virus de Epstein‐Barr y el largo periodo de incubatión puede complicar el diagnóstico. Se describe un muchacho de 15 aflos con infección por el virus de Epstein‐Barr, complicada con una trombocitopenia prolongada que amenazó su vida, neuropatia craneal y neuropatia periferica sensorio‐motora. El número bajo de plaquetas no respondió a múltiples tratam ientos incluyendo la esplenectomia, pero se normalizeó a los 13 meses del inicio. La recuperation neurológica fue lenta; el paciente sigue leniendo una neuropatia moderada sensoriomotora periférica tres años después del inicio de la enfermedad. Hay que tener presente la infección por el virus de Epstein‐Barr en pacientes con problemas neurológicos asociados a una trombocitopenia. La medición de anticuerpos los proteinas del virus de Epatein‐Barr facilita el diagnóstico de la infección.",

Patients with psychiatric diseases and/or substance abuse have an increased risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Furthermore, psychiatric problems occur frequently during antiviral treatment and may be associated with the use of interferon alpha (IFN-α) but also with the primary psychiatric condition. As a consequence, substance abuse and/or acute psychiatric problems are still important reasons for nontreatment of chronic HCV infection. However, prospective and controlled data from recent years showed that if an interdisciplinary treatment is provided, patients with substance use disorders and/or psychiatric diseases do not differ regarding sustained virologic response or IFN-α-associated complications such as depression when compared with controls. Moreover, depression as the most important acute IFN-α-associated psychiatric adverse event can be acutely treated or even prevented by antidepressant pretreatment. Other, more rare but severe complications such as mania, psychotic symptoms, or delirium need individual psychiatric interventions.",

      "abstract": "Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop ICU-acquired weakness, which is characterized by acute or subacute onset diffuse limb weakness, during the early course of their severe illness and is related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, hospital stay, and even increased mortality. The development of generalized weakness or paralysis may be because of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and a combination of both. The basic mechanisms underlying these disorders are complex and poorly understood. Several risk factors, including severe sepsis and multiple organ failure, are implicated, whereas the effects of the use of steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents and hyperglycemia on the development of this condition remain to be clarified. Furthermore, whether each risk factor is associated with the development of CIP, CIM, or both has not been clarified thus far. Typically, the condition of patients is diagnosed on the basis of the assessment of risk factors, neurological findings, and electrophysiological examinations, including nerve conduction study and needle electromyography. In addition, muscle biopsy and direct muscle stimulation test can be used to distinguish CIP from CIM. To date, no therapeutic approach has been established for ICU-acquired weakness, and potential preventive measures should be implemented in the daily management of the critically ill patients. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of these disorders and to identify appropriate therapeutic options.",

Although having a multifactorial ethiopathology, the major risk factors in the development of these disorders are multiple organ failure and sepsis for polyneuropathy; corticosteroids and neuromuscular junction blocking agents (NMB) for myopathy; and NMB and renal and liver failure for prolonged neuromuscular blockade. No specific treatment exists, which is why--due to the high incidence of these syndromes and their poor prognosis, with a mortality rate higher than 50%--we should recognise, diagnose and avoid, where possible, the conditions that help the development of these disorders.",

More unforeseen was this patient's lingering amnestic syndrome and global lowering of many ‘higher’ cognitive processes, e.g. intelligence, reasoning, concentration, etc. The role of the brainstem in ‘higher’ cognitive functions is considered through four mechanisms: the reticular activating system, disruption of neocorticat-ponto-cerebellar networks, the preliminary processing model, and through interruption of neurotransmitter pathways.",

Our objective was to review uncommon neurologic disorders and summarize both the underlying disease process, and the relevant disease-specific research on the impact of the neurologic condition on the lower urinary tract. Among the degenerative and traumatic brain disorders, we have included frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's Disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, and traumatic brain injury. Among the autoimmune disorders, we reviewed transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease, glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy, and meningitis-retention syndrome (a form of aseptic meningitis that presents with urinary retention). Hereditary spastic paraplegia, VACTERL association, and several peripheral neuropathies (Guillain Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, autoimmune autonomic gangliopathy, Wolfram syndrome spectrum disorder (a progressive peripheral neuropathy disorder with early onset diabetes, optic atrophy and megacystis in the early stage), Charcot Marie Tooth disease, and amyloid neuropathy are included.

The neurological complications secondary to bacterial meningitis contribute to the high mortality rate and to disability among the survivors. Cerebrovascular complications, including infarction and hemorrhage, are common. Inflammation and increased pressure in the subarachnoid space result in cranial neuropathy. Seizures occur in either the acute or delayed phase after the infection and require early detection and treatment. Spreading of infection to other intracranial structures, including the subdural space, brain parenchyma, and ventricles, increases morbidity and mortality in survivors. Infection can also spread to the spinal canal causing spinal cord abscess, epidural abscess, polyradiculitis, and spinal cord infarction secondary to vasculitis of the spinal artery. Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction is also an uncommon complication after bacterial meningitis. Damage to cerebral structures contributes to cognitive and neuropsychiatric problems.  Being aware of these complications leads to early detection and treatment and improves mortality and outcomes in patients with bacterial meningitis.",

On physical examination a relative afferent pupillary defect of the right eye was noted. Visual evoked potential test revealed delayed P100 latency bilaterally, confirming a bilateral optic neuropathy. The analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a lymphocytic meningitis. After an extensive work-up, a diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis with meningitis and optic neuritis was made. The patient was treated with antibiotics and showed gradual improvement. The follow-up brain MRI revealed a mild T2 hyperintensity on the right optic nerve with gliosis, sequelae of the inflammatory process. Lyme disease should always be considered in patients from endemic areas with nonspecific symptoms. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is challenging, but prompt identification and treatment can prevent the development of complications and sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Background: Most cases of dementia are due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, but attention on these disorders means that other important causes of dementia may be relatively neglected. About 10–15% of people with dementia have other diagnoses, and there are numerous causes of the less common types of dementia. Aims: This paper provides information about the causes, symptoms, diagnosis and nursing management of some of the different types of less common dementias, with the aim of helping nurses to provide better care to patients and families affected. Methods: This is one of two connected papers and provides a narrative review of the literature on the clinical presentation of frontotemporal dementia, HIV dementia, prion dementias and alcohol-related dementia. Findings: Frontotemporal dementia has important clinical subtypes with distinct different presentations; for example, predominantly behavioural symptoms or progressive language dysfunction. Alcohol-related dementia is one of several types of alcohol-related brain damage. This is important as, with abstinence, its progression may be halted or even to some extent improved. HIV dementia has become less common since the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy, but, nonetheless, the less severe picture of HIV-associated cognitive dysfunction remains prevalent despite treatment. Prion dementias encompass sporadic, familial and acquired Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and are incurable, therefore requiring extensive palliative care. Conclusions: These forms of dementia all have different symptoms and courses from common types of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. It is important for nurses to be aware that dementia may have several causes and that people with different dementias will have different needs. Nonetheless, the general skills of nurses in supporting patients and families remain essential in order to develop appropriate care plans and to provide individualised, person-centred care.",

So far, the reasons for the Tropheryma whipplei infection have not been explained. Clinical symptoms are non-specific and may suggest other diseases, mainly gastrointestinal disease. Nervous system symptoms such as personality disorders, behavioral disorders, depressive symptoms and disturbances of consciousness are also observed. The aim of the study is to collect information on neuropsychological disorders found in Whipple’s disease. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement can take place in three cases: classic form, in the relapse of previously treated classic form (with changes in the digestive system) and in isolated CNS infection (without evidence of gastrointestinal involvement by T. whipplei). Neurological disorders resulting from CNS involvement are variable and may be similar to other diseases of the nervous system. Treatment is difficult due to the long-term course of the disease and non-specificity of its symptoms, which is why the problem is the selection of effective pharmacotherapy. Untreated disease results in worsening neuropsychological disorders. Pharmacotherapy involves the use of antibiotics. The use of antibacterial therapy reduces the risk of recurrence of clinical symptoms.",

      "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Neuroinflammation in ME/CFS and Long COVID to Sustain Disease and Promote Relapses",
      "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disease now well-documented as having arisen commonly from a viral infection, but also from other external stressors, like exposure to agricultural chemicals, other types of infection, surgery, or other severe stress events. Research has shown these events produce a systemic molecular inflammatory response and chronic immune activation and dysregulation. What has been more difficult to establish is the hierarchy of the physiological responses that give rise to the myriad of symptoms that ME/CFS patients experience, and why they do not resolve and are generally life-long. The severity of the symptoms frequently fluctuates through relapse recovery periods, with brain-centered symptoms of neuroinflammation, loss of homeostatic control, \"brain fog\" affecting cognitive ability, lack of refreshing sleep, and poor response to even small stresses. How these brain effects develop with ME/CFS from the initiating external effector, whether virus or other cause, is poorly understood and that is what our paper aims to address. We propose the hypothesis that following the initial stressor event, the subsequent systemic pathology moves to the brain via neurovascular pathways or through a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in chronic neuroinflammation and leading to a sustained illness with chronic relapse recovery cycles. Signaling through recognized pathways from the brain back to body physiology is likely part of the process by which the illness cycle in the peripheral system is sustained and why healing does not occur. By contrast, Long COVID (Post-COVID-19 condition) is a very recent ME/CFS-like illness arising from the single pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2. We believe the ME/CFS-like ongoing effects of Long COVID are arising by very similar mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, but likely with some unique signaling, resulting from the pathology of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that there are very similar symptoms in both ongoing diseases, despite the diversity in the nature of the initial stressors, supports the concept of a similar dysfunctional CNS component common to both.",

      "abstract": "Medically unexplained visual loss, or functional visual loss, or nonorganic visual loss (NOVL) denotes diminished visual acuity or field without discernible ocular or neurological pathology. Variously termed in the literature, it eludes organic diagnosis following a thorough examination. Symptoms range from mild blurriness to total blindness, sometimes presenting as tunnel vision or hemianopias. Diagnosis entails comprehensive eye evaluation to exclude organic causes like refractive error or cataracts. NOVL frequently correlates with psychological conditions like depression or anxiety, implicating psychological influence in its etiology. Thus, NOVL underscores the complex interplay between physical and psychological factors in visual impairment, necessitating holistic diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This chapter elucidates the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms pertaining to functional visual disorder (FVD) or nonorganic vision loss (NOVL), prevalent presentations posing diagnostic challenges across diverse medical disciplines. It delineates the historical evolution of terminology denoting patients manifesting vision loss incongruous with established neurological or ophthalmic pathologies, necessitating a collaborative, interprofessional approach. Diagnostic modalities, ranging from meticulous ocular assessments to comprehensive psychological evaluations, reflect the intricate etiological spectrum underlying NOVL. This exposition serves as a pivotal reference for healthcare professionals navigating the diagnostic intricacies and therapeutic imperatives intrinsic to NOVL, advocating for a holistic, patient-centric approach underscored by scientific rigor, and compassionate care.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disease of unknown origin with symptoms which are suggestive of either chronic viral infection or an atypical psychiatric disorder. I The primary diagnostic criteria are subjective debilitating fatigue and exclusion of other chronic conditions including psychiatric illness. Secondary diagnostic criteria include somatic symptoms; neuropsychological complaints are considered to be a supporting syrnptom.! However, mood disorders are common in CFS with approximately 50% of patients suffering from affective disorder and a further 25% from anxiety or somatization. We hypothesized that the psychiatric and viral theories regarding the cause of CFS are not mutually exclusive. Infection by one of a number of viruses may trigger a non-specific and atypical reaction in certain individuals, which may have a large psychia tric and self-perpetuating component. In 50% of individuals with CFS serum folate concentrations are below 3 Jlg/L (the limit below which serum folate is considered to be deficientj.' This is consistent with the viral infection hypothesis-folate deficiency is often associated with viral infections, which increase the demand for DNA, RNA and protein synthesis in all tissues, but particularly in the immune system. Folate deficiency, due both to poor nutrition and to severe inherited defects in the enzyme 5, lO-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), causes psychiatric disorders and demyelinating disease.v' MTHFR catalyses the final step in the conversion of dietary forms of folate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the main transport form of folate in serum, and the form",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune encephalopathies are clinically manifested as limbic or diff use encephalitis. According to the etiology, they are classified as paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic. Signs and symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis are variable. The symptomatologycommonly includes headache and epileptic attacks often progressing to epileptic status, movement disorders (ataxia, dyskinesias,chorea, dystonia and tremor), behavior changes, cognitive impairments, psychoses and various degrees of disorders ofconsciousness. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures can precede the development of limbic encephalitis. Autonomic dysfunction, sleepdisorders and hypoventilation are often present. The development of autoimmune encephalopathies can be induced by eithertumor or viral antigens. However, in a signifi cant number of cases, disease triggers remain unidentifi ed. According to the localizationof target antigens, autoimmune encephalopathies can be divided into those caused by antibodies against intracellular antigens(Ma2,Hu) and those caused by antibodies against cell surface antigens, i.e. synaptic antigens (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor(NMDAR), voltage-gated potassium channel complex/LGI1). The former are paraneoplastic in origin, more often in adults andrespond poorly to immunotherapy. The latter ones can aff ect children as well, and are usually-responsive to immunotherapy. Antibodiescan be detected in both cerebrospinal fl uid and serum. Mild pleocytosis and/or oligoclonal bands can be found in cerebrospinalfl uid but in some patients the cerebrospinal examination fi ndings can be completely normal. The electroencephalography fi ndingconsists of diff use, slow dysrhythmic encephalopathic changes or so-called extreme delta brushes and focal epileptogenicchanges, i.e. paroxysmal bursts in case of limbic encephalitis. Magnetic resonance image fi nding of the brain is usually normal orpresents transient sub/cortical hyperintensities in T2-weighted images but is signifi cant for the diagnosis of limbic encephalitis.Early recognition of autoimmune encephalopathy is of utmost importance because of the need of proper diagnostic procedure andtimely introduction of appropriate therapy.",

      "abstract": "Cough is a common respiratory complaint driving patients to seek medical advice. Besides being a fundamental respiratory sign, it is also a crucial neurological sign. There are three main types of coughs: Reflex cough (type I), voluntary cough (type II), and evoked cough (type III). Cough is a reflex predominantly mediated by control centers in the respiratory areas of the brainstem, modulated by the cerebral cortex. Cough reflex sensitivity could be increased in many neurological disorders such as brainstem space-occupying lesions, medullary lesions secondary to Chiari type I malformations, tics disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, somatic cough, cerebellar neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic vagal neuropathy due to allergic and non-allergic conditions. Meanwhile, cough sensitivity decreases in multiple sclerosis, brain hypoxia, cerebral hemispheric stroke with a brainstem shock, Parkinson's disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy as diabetic neuropathy, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, vitamin B12, and folate deficiency. Arnold's nerve ear-cough reflex, syncopal cough, cough headache, opioids-associated cough, and cough-anal reflex are signs that could help diagnose underlying neurological conditions. Cough reflex testing is a quick, easy, and cheap test performed during the cranial nerve examination. In this article, we reviewed the role of cough in various neurological disorders that increase or decrease cough sensitivity.",

Kognitive Defizite können bereits früh im Krankheitsgeschehen, beispielsweise bei einem Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) oder Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) auftreten und werden auch bei Patienten mit einem benignen Verlauf beobachtet. Obgleich die Progression als eher moderat betrachtet werden kann, wirken sich kognitive Einbußen in beinahe jedem Stadium stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität und die Therapieadhärenz aus. Diagnostisch sind wir in der Lage mittels sensitiver Screeninginstrumente diejenigen kognitiven Teilfunktionen zu erfassen, die bei MS-Patienten am häufigsten beeinträchtigt sind. Wie so häufig in der Medizin hinkt jedoch die Therapie dem Fortschritt bei der Diagnostik hinterher, sodass wir keine zuverlässige evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie zur Behandlung kognitiver Defizite bei MS zur Verfügung haben. Derzeit sind nonpharmakologische Ansätze, mit dem Ziel die kognitive Reserve des Gehirns zu stärken, Erfolg versprechend. Methodisch saubere Wirksamkeitsstudien stehen allerdings noch aus.",

Several stressors associated with aging with HIV may result in increased levels of depression and suicidal ideation. In addition, neurological and cognitive changes that often accompany both aging and HIV must be considered because those aging with HIV are at greater risk of developing such problems. These problems may be reflected in executive functioning deficits and initiation and perseveration difficulties. Adults experiencing such problems may be predisposed to ruminative thoughts that can impair the ability to effectively cope with the stressors associated with aging with HIV. Moreover, other conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic drug use, and mitochondrial-damage-related fatigue can predispose these adults to the development of further neurological and cognitive problems. These problems may foster further ruminative thinking and increase the severity of depression and suicidal ideation. Implications for nursing practice, intervention, and research are provided.",

In Africa Sub-Saharan, and more particularly in the DRC, Neuropalaria, knows a high frequency of neurological lesions with a very high lethality and the seriousness of their repercussions on the fate of the children who are victims of it. The neuropathological severity of acute malarial cerebral aggression is correlated with the high parasite density, with the phenomena of sequestration and cytoadherence, the inflammatory process, the presence of the factors of bad prognosis or ACSOS, the diagnostic and therapeutic delay; and the antimalarials, do not modify the evolutionary process of neurological lesions and those of sequelae. An approach Neuroadapted therapy (Citicholine and neuroregulators) introduced in our patients, from the acute phase (from D0: in first 24 hours / first 6 hours +++ to 7 days), until the stabilization phase (D0- 30 days), allowed us to: Improve perfusion of the areas of ischemic brain suffering, regulation of cerebral metabolism (aerobic glycolysis +++) and reduction of cerebral edema (vasogenic, cytotoxic +++); delay the evolution of the destruction of the neuronal membrane and neuronal degeneration; limit and block ischemic cascades leading to neuronal necrosis; Improve the prognosis and dramatic rapid recovery, speech recovery and significant reduction in other neurological sequelae, but also death-mortality.

Under Citicholine(Somazina) and Neuroregulators (Gamalate B6, Surmenalite), resumption of language 24 hours later, with end of tremors (impairment of central gray nuclei) under Artane ½ tablet for 7 days with a good spectacular development. File close and exit authorized with Trausan, Surmenalite and Gamalate B6 for 1 month; an appointment in 1 month with a cerebral CT-scan control. The second case; she is a 27-year-old patient, admitted for temporo-spatial disorientation and headache. contributory, in whom the clinical examination notes a BP: 158/87 mm Hg, HR: 112bpm, FR: 24 cpm, patient with temporal disorientation spatial, EG altered by suffering mine, Colored eyelid conjunctiva and bulbar anicteric, on normal gynecological examination, on neurological examination; flexible neck and no signs of neuro-meningeal irritation, isocoric and reflective pupils. At the exam paraclinical; GE: Tropho +; incidental blood sugar: 112 mg / dl, Hb: 12 g / l, ESR: 60mm / H, GB: 12200elt, FLN62% L38%, Urinary sed (GB: 5-10 / elt, EC: 5-10 / elt), treatment with Artesunate, promethazine, ceftrin plus. The evolution was marked by a motor aphasia of Broca, a few hours after admission, a cerebral CT scan was urgently requested, not carried out given the financial situation patient, and she was on citicholine (Somazina) as a continuous infusion with antioxidants (VIT C, VIT E) in emergency, neurosedation with phenobarbital. On day 1 of hospitalization, i.e. 24 hours of hospitalization later, we observed the resumption of speech with temporo-spatial orientation, and vital signs in physiological norms. File close and exit authorized with Somazina tablet, Gamalate B6, Overmenalitis for 1 month. Conclusion: Before any case of acute malarial encephalitis (cerebral malaria), it is of interest to add the neuroregulatory therapeutic regimen; improving the prognosis (rapid recovery), preventing the occurrence of neurological complications often irreversible and reduced morbidity and mortality. And Antimalarials, do not modify the evolutionary process of destruction neuronal and neurological sequelae.",

Little has been written however about the long-term psychiatric status of individuals following recovery from the acute phase of autoimmune encephalitis, despite case series and anecdotal evidence suggesting this may be a cause of considerable disability. Here, we describe a man aged 58 years with no psychiatric history who developed a severe and acute psychotic disorder following resolution of a protracted course of limbic encephalitis associated with antibodies to leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 protein. No indications of a gross ongoing inflammatory or encephalopathic process were present at presentation of his psychosis. Possible aetiologies of his acute psychosis are discussed. This case highlights the importance of ongoing psychiatric follow-up of patients following an episode of autoimmune encephalitis.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Information-processing dysfunctions differ between clinical subtypes such that nonparanoid schizophrenia patients attend less than paranoid schizophrenia patients to connotative or contextual aspects of stimuli. The positive and negative symptom dimensions are also associated with distinct cognitive deficits. In general, positive symptoms are related to auditory-processing deficits and negative symptoms to visual/motor dysfunctions. The interaction of frontal and septohippocampal brain systems, and failures of information-processing automaticity and self-monitoring, have been proposed as the bases of positive symptoms. Negative symptoms are thought to arise from abnormalities in the complex interactions of frontal and striatal systems. Recent theoretical analyses have recommended a focus on the cognitive and neuropsychological analysis of specific symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) instead of on the more heterogeneous symptom clusters or dimensions. Studies of specific symptoms indicate that patients with hallucinations have deficits in discriminating the source of information. Delusions have been related to abnormal inference processes as well as abnormal perceptual experiences. Studies should now examine the links between information-processing abnormalities and symptoms over time, as the latter change, within the framework of explicit, disconfirmable theoretical models.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common co-morbidities of cerebrovascular disorders is neuroinflammation, a hallmark and decisive contributor to many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although neuropathological conditions differ in etiology and in the way in which the inflammatory response is mounted, cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are probably similar in aging, hypertension, depression and cognitive impairment or after cerebral insult such as stroke. Moreover, a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis are increasingly understood to act as “silent contributors” to neuroinflammation – not only establishing the condition as a central pathophysiological mechanism, but also constantly fuelling it. Mild, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and subsequent dementia. Acute neuroinflammation, often in the context of traumatic or ischemic CNS lesions, aggravates the acute damage and can lead to depression, post-stroke dementia and neurodegeneration. All of these sequelae impair recovery and provide the ground for further cerebrovascular events.",

Secondo l’ International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), l’eccessivo comportamento sessuale è da ricondursi a un comportamento compulsivo. Seguendo la panoramica scientifica attuale, l’ipersessualità può essere il risultato di molteplici condizioni psicopatologiche. Pertanto, il modello bio-psico-sociale sembra essere quello più appropriato per spiegare l’eziologia spesso multifattoriale di questo sintomo. In ambito psicopatologico è possibile riscontrare l’ipersessualità nelle fasi maniacali, nel disturbo borderline di personalità, in associazione al disturbo da deficit di attenzione con iperattività (ADHD), nelle psicosi. In aggiunta, pazienti che presentano deficit neurologici a causa di lesioni cerebrali, o che sono diagnosticati con sindromi neurologiche, possono presentare l’ipersessualità, come causa diretta della malattia o a causa indiretta delle terapie farmacologiche adottate per la gestione della sindrome. Un assessment preciso e globale, che veda l’approfondimento di tutte le variabili che possono spiegare l’insorgenza di tale sintomo, sembra necessario per l’inquadramento diagnostico e l’impostazione della terapia.",

There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).",

We report two Sri Lankan patients who fulfil the above diagnostic criteria but have contrasting clinical courses over a 4-year follow-up period. The NMOIgG seropositive patient demonstrated a more severe, relapsing disease course whilst the seronegative patient did not relapse despite not being on long-term immunosuppressive therapy.

      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischaemic damage to the developing brain is a leading cause of child death, with high mortality and morbidity, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and cognitive disabilities. The developmental stage of the brain and the severity of the insult influence the selective regional vulnerability and the subsequent clinical manifestations. The increased susceptibility to hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) of periventricular white matter in preterm infants predisposes the immature brain to motor, cognitive, and sensory deficits, with cognitive impairment associated with earlier gestational age. In term infants HI causes selective damage to sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. Even though the immature brain is more malleable to external stimuli compared to the adult one, a hypoxic-ischaemic event to the neonate interrupts the shaping of central motor pathways and can affect normal developmental plasticity through altering neurotransmission, changes in cellular signalling, neural connectivity and function, wrong targeted innervation, and interruption of developmental apoptosis. Models of neonatal HI demonstrate three morphologically different types of cell death, that is, apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, which crosstalk and can exist as a continuum in the same cell. In the present review we discuss the mechanisms of HI injury to the immature brain and the way they affect plasticity.",

Neuro-inflammation can result secondary to nerve damage, from an immune response to an antigen located on or near the peripheral nerve or in response to a frank neuritis. These conditions have several elements in common including macrophage infiltration, increased numbers of activated T cells and up-regulation of several of the proinflammatory cytokines. The most studied neuropathic model with respect to immune activation is the chronic constriction injury (CCI) or Bennett model [1]. In the original model, four loose ligatures of chromic gut are placed around the sciatic nerve just above the knee. The ligatures are tied just tightly enough to barely constrict the nerve and importantly they reduce, but do not halt, blood flow through the epineurial vasculature. This model produces thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia and/or spontaneous pain of duration varying from one week to one month depending on the lab.",

There are a number of reports of celiac disease associated with neuropathy, ataxia, dementia and seizure disorder. In these reports, there is no clear relationship with nutrient deficiency and a precise mechanism for the neurological changes has not been defined. A small number of patients have been reported to have responded to vitamin E administration, but most do not. In some, gluten antibodies have also been described, especially in those with ataxia, but a consistent response to a gluten-free diet has not been defined. Screening for celiac disease should be considered in patients with unexplained neurological disorders, including ataxia and dementia. Further studies are needed, however, to determine if a gluten-free diet will lead to improvement in the associated neurological disorder.",

We aim to summarize the current knowledge on immune-mediated neuromyotonia, focusing on clinical presentations, pathophysiology, and management. Neuromyotonia is a major feature of several autoimmune neurological syndromes characterized by PNH with or without central neurological system involvement. Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that anti-CASPR2 antibodies are directly pathogenic in autoimmune neuromyotonia patients. Neuromyotonia, a form of PNH, is a major feature in several syndromes associated with anti-CASPR2 antibodies, including cramp-fasciculation syndrome, Isaacs syndrome, Morvan syndrome, and autoimmune limbic encephalitis. Diagnosis relies on the identification of motor, sensory, and autonomic signs of PNH along with other neurological symptoms, anti-CASPR2 antibody-positivity, and of characteristic electroneuromyographic abnormalities. Paraneoplastic associations with thymoma are possible, especially in Morvan syndrome. Patients usually respond to immune-active treatments, including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchanges, and rituximab.",

The severity of the phenotype is dependent on the degree of cerebral insult, extent of subsequent injury incurred; with some correlation with outcome [1–4]. Because of the wide variety and often changing signs and symptoms post HI, coupled with the numerous co-morbid metabolic and systemic problems and the frequent occurrence of seizures which can be very difficult to differentiate clinically, this article will concentrate solely on describing the hyperkinetic non-epileptic movement disorder observed following transient HI in the term newborn.",

Other neurological diseases may indeed be overlooked in the context of cirrhosis or confuse the physician regarding the diagnosis. Chronic acquired hepatocerebral degeneration (CAHD) is an uncommon problem occurring in patients with cirrhosis characterised by a Parkinsonian-like neurological presentation with damage to the brain secondary to manganese (Mn) deposition.

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

CP is neither a specific disease nor a pathological or aetiological entity, and importantly the term CP does not—and should not—necessarily imply or identify a specific cause. The prevalence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births, with the risk highest among very preterm and low birthweight babies. However, the majority of children with CP are born at or near term gestation. Causes of CP include perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, intra- or periventricular haemorrhage, cerebral dysgenesis, and intracranial infection. The CP syndromes may be classified by the predominant type of motor disturbance, including, for example, diplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia, dyskinesia, and ataxia, although frequently the overall clinical picture is not always pure. Finally, the aetiologies for these different syndromes tend to be quite distinct.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of CP has been made on the basis of the child's symptoms and signs, each child should undergo appropriate evaluation and investigation to try and establish a cause and specifically to determine whether it is of prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal origin. Investigation is indicated even when there has been evidence of a preceding neurological event during the perinatal period or infancy, because some of these children may have an underlying neurological or metabolic disorder which may have made them more vulnerable to the stresses of delivery and extrauterine life. Finally, it is important that all children with a diagnosis of CP should be followed up, and when no obvious cause has been identified or there …",

Two case studies of HIV‐infected women are presented. Psychoactive substance use disorders are the most common Axis I diagnoses, followed by depression. The most frequently diagnosed Axis II disorders are borderline and antisocial personality disorders. These women reported histories that often included alcohol and other drug use, childhood sexual abuse, violent interpersonal relationships, depression, and learning disabilities. Earlier intervention addressing these problems might have prevented the onset of psychiatric disorders as well as high‐risk behaviors that lead to HIV infection.",

The seasonal acute syndromes of cranial neuritis or radiculoneuritis are generally quite distinctive, but may cause diagnostic difficulty when one syndrome occurs without the other, when erythema migrans is absent or missed, and when meningeal signs are minimal or absent. The chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathies are less severe, and less distinctive. Their recognition depends on eliciting a history of earlier classical manifestations of Lyme disease and by laboratory testing. In both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy, electrophysiologic testing often proves the presence of a sensorimotor, axon loss polyradiculoneuropathy. Both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy have similar pathologic features and can be classified as a nonvasculitic mononeuritis multiplex. The pathogenesis is uncertain; both direct infection as well as parainfectious mechanisms may play a role. The treatment with which we have the most experience is intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 2 to 4 weeks. Improvement occurs rapidly over days to weeks in early Lyme neuroborreliosis, but slowly over many months in chronic neuroborreliosis.",

This muscle weakness has been described in a widerange of clinical settings and therefore, has many different terminologies such as “critical illness myopathy – CIM”,“critical illness polyneuropathy - CIP”, “acute quadriplegic myopathy”, among others. Nowadays, thesedesignations are considered somewhat restrictive, therefore most authors adopt the more wide rangedesignation of “ICU-Acquired Weakness”. Generally, these patients have a flacid tetraparesis without cranial nerve palsy, normal or diminishedosteotendinous reflexes and no sensitive alterations unless on the cases traditionally classified as polyneuropathy.The diagnosis of ICU-AW is often difficult, and should be suspected whenever a critical ill patient has unexplainedweakness. Traditionally, the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases is based in nerve conduction studies andelectromyography. Muscle biopsy can be used to confirm or exclude myopathy, but is not a routine exam.Since there is a significant percentage of critical patients that develop muscle weakness it is important to screenall patients in the ICU, avoid potential toxic re-exposures on the identified patients and begin early rehabilitation.However, two questions arise from this screening: if the screening is only clinical are we underestimating thesepatients? If electrophysiological are we overestimating ICU-AW?There are no specific therapies for ICU-AW. The criterious use of some drugs is one of the possible measures to betaken. On the other hand, the early inclusion of these patients in a rehabilitation program seems to be helpfulfor a speedy functional recovery.There are few studies regarding ICU-AW, and systematic studies with longer follow-ups and bigger samples arenecessary to determine the most effective rehabilitation approach for these patients.

APS may occur as a primary disorder or in the setting of underlying lupus. Common systemic manifestations include deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism, livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, and fetal loss. The most common neurological consequence is stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) due either to in situ thrombosis or embolic disease. APS should be a primary consideration in a young patient with unexplained stroke/TIA. CNS abnormalities may occur in the absence of stroke, thought to be related to direct neuronal injury by aPL. Cognitive dysfunction is relatively common and has been shown to be associated with the presence of white matter lesions on MRI and livedo reticularis. T2 hyperintensities on MRI may be difficult to distinguish from those seen in multiple sclerosis. Less commonly reported neurological symptoms associated with aPL include chorea, transverse myelopathy, migraine, seizures, sensorineural hearing loss, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with stroke and persistent aPL should be treated with long-term anticoagulation. Select patients with other aPL-associated neurological syndromes may be treated with anticoagulation and/or immunomodulatory therapy on a case-by-case basis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Neurologic symptoms in Wilson disease (WD) appear at an older age compared to hepatic symptoms and manifest in patients with misdiagnosed liver disease, in patients when the hepatic stage is clinically silent, in the case of non-compliance with anti-copper treatment, or with treatment failure. Neurologic symptoms in WD are caused by nervous tissue damage that is primarily a consequence of extrahepatic copper toxicity. Copper levels in brain tissues as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are diffusely increased by a factor of 10 and its toxicity involves various mechanisms such as mitochondrial toxicity, oxidative stress, cell membrane damage, crosslinking of DNA, and inhibition of enzymes. Excess copper is initially taken-up and buffered by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes but ultimately causes dysfunction of blood-brain-barrier and demyelination. Most severe neuropathologic abnormalities, including tissue rarefaction, reactive astrogliosis, myelin palor, and presence of iron-laden macrophages, are typically present in the putamen while other basal ganglia, thalami, and brainstem are usually less affected. The most common neurologic symptoms of WD are movement disorders including tremor, dystonia, parkinsonism, ataxia and chorea which are associated with dysphagia, dysarthria and drooling. Patients usually manifest with various combinations of these symptoms while purely monosymptomatic presentation is rare. Neurologic symptoms are largely reversible with anti-copper treatment, but a significant number of patients are left with residual impairment. The approach for symptomatic treatment in WD is based on guidelines for management of common movement disorders. The vast majority of WD patients with neurologic symptoms have abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pathologic MRI changes include T2 hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, thalami and white matter, T2 hypointensities in the basal ganglia, and atrophy. Most importantly, brain damage and neurologic symptoms can be prevented with an early initiation of anti-copper treatment. Introducing population WD screening, e.g., by exome sequencing genetic methods, would allow early treatment and decrease the neurologic burden of WD.",

Cognitive disorders often complicate the course and prognosis of acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease [5]. According to the classification of E.V. Schmidt (1975), the term dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE) is traditionally used to define the chronic form of cerebral vascular insufficiency [10]. Different stages of the disease are characterized by different degree of severity and type of cognitive impairment. The presence of such disorders in patients with DE is a criterion for a more accurate staging of the disease. In our opinion, if the degree of cognitive impairment is compared with the severity of cerebrovascular disease, then mild cognitive impairment corresponds to stage I-II DE [11].",

      "title": "2 cases of hypertrophic CIDP associated to other autoimmune neurological disorders: Myasthenia Gravis and Multiple Sclerosis. (P2.4-025)",
      "abstract": "Objective: NA Background: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) associated to Myasthenia Gravis (MG) or Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is scarcely described. Different from MG, MS and CIDP share some fundamental immunological principles. In both MS and CIDP, dysfunction of immune tolerance mechanisms causes humoral and cellular autoimmunity to the complex of the myelin sheath and axon. Design/Methods: NA Results: Case 1: 46-year-old man presenting with paresthesia, pain and slowly progressive weakness with distally predominance on limbs followed by sensitive ataxia and areflexia. CSF showed elevated protein level without pleiocytosis and signs of diffuse demyelination on electromyoneurogram (EMNG). On MRI, cranial nerves, cervical and lumbar roots and plexus with severe thickness was observed. Treated with Intravenous Immunoglobulins, prednisolone and Azatioprine. After 9 years, patient presented ptosis, dyplopia, dysphagia, dysphonia and positive antibodies (AchR) for MG. Case 2: 52-year-old woman presenting with spastic paraparesis, loss of sensitivity on lower limbs and hands, areflexia and bilateral Babinski. CSF showed elevated protein level without pleiocytosis and presence of oligoclonal bands. Severe demyelinating neuropathy was observed at EMNG. MRI: difuse demyelination in CNS and severe thickness of lumbar roots and plexus. Iniciated treatment with mensal Intravenous immunoglobulin, Prednisolone, Azatioprine and Fingolimod presenting in 18 moths significant clinical improvement. Conclusions: Combination of CIDP and MG is rare. It is speculated that both Th1 and Th2 cells are involved in their coexistence. The abnormal activation of immune system produces cross-reacting antibodies, which attack the AchR of neuromuscular junctions and the myelin protein of peripheral nerves. Also, the occurrence of CIDP associated to MS may be fortuitous. However, there is growing evidence of common risk factors, such as immunopathogenetic mechanisms, including shared myelin antigens, common immunologic factors, endothelial alterations, and altered expression of adhesion molecules. Both cases have association with autoimmune diseases, corroborating the literature, therefore more studies about this correlation are still necessary.

The condition is rare and genetically heterogeneous, often caused by mutations in the FLNA gene. The most common symptoms are epileptic seizures. PNH is often associated with other conditions such as cardiovascular abnormalities. CASE PRESENTATION A young man was admitted to hospital after a first episode of loss of consciousness. The patient was in normal general condition upon admission, and the clinical examination revealed no abnormalities. However, cerebral imaging performed upon admittance showed PNH, while an extended cardiac examination revealed atrioventricular block with the indication for a pacemaker. After pacemaker implantation and introduction of antiepileptic drug therapy, the patient has been free of symptoms. INTERPRETATION PNH is a condition that needs multidisciplinary assessments.",

Neuropsychological assessment showed underlying significant cognitive deficits, mostly of complex attention and speed of information processing, visuospatial and constructional abilities, verbal and nonverbal memory, and executive functions. These deficits remained stable or slightly improved in follow-up assessments. Cognitive dysfunction should be suspected in case of psychiatric or psychiatric-related symptoms in MMD patients.

DSPN also represents a complex symptom that occurs because of peripheral nerve damage related to advanced HIV disease and in association with the use of antiretroviral therapy—particularly in individuals treated with dideoxynucleosides. Although DSPN is a frequent symptom, the specific pathophysiology is not well understood. The HIV-related neuropathies are commonly categorized as distal sensory polyneuropathies, although antiretroviral toxic neuropathies are described in the literature. Recently, mitochondrial toxicity has been identified as a possible etiology of DSPN. As individuals with HIV/AIDS survive longer, often living for decades with the disease, chronic symptoms like DSPN must be addressed. Pharmacologic approaches, complementary therapies, and self-care behaviors that may improve quality of life and limit symptoms of DSPN are important interventions for clinicians and those living with HIV/AIDS to consider in the management of peripheral neuropathy.",

However, this complete triad is not always seen; therefore, it is difficult to make the diagnosis. NPH can be divided into primary or idiopathic NPH and secondary NPH. Diagnostic criteria for NPH remain a topic of discussion; however, the development of diagnostic techniques has brought new opportunities for diagnosis. The aim of this review is to present an overview of neurophysiological and neuropsychological approaches to support the clinical evaluation of patients with NPH and contribute to the differential diagnosis of NPH and dementia, as the clinical symptoms of NPH may resemble other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Easy life style, including physical activity, healthy dietary habits as well as good mental health are characterized by an efficient immune response. Life style is related to the type of occupational activity since work has a central part in life either as source of income or contributing to represent the social identity. Not only occupational stress, but also job loss or insecurity are thus considered serious stressful situations, inducing emotional disorders which may affect both neuroendocrine and immune systems; reduced reactivity to mitogens and/or decreased blood NK cytotoxic activity was reported in unemployed workers or in those with a high perception of job insecurity and/or job stress. Although genetic factors have a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, occupational stress (as in night shifts) was reported associated to an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders. Monitoring blood NK response may thus be included in the health programs as an indirect index of stressful job and/or poor lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Determining the prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is complicated by several factors: under-recognition of NCSE with its spontaneous resolution (thus decreasing the denominator of total cases that will have a poor outcome); incorrect diagnosis of NCSE based on misinterpretation of EEG epileptiform activity; mis-classification of certain EEG patterns as NCSE (e.g. PLEDs; triphasic waves); and grouping of different populations that have markedly different co-morbidities (ambulatory patients with NCSE together with comatose patients with electrographic seizure activity on EEG). There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Idiopathic optic neuritis is an optic neuropathy with characteristics of optic nerve dysfunction that can be caused by various disorders of the optic nerve, including optic neuromyelitis, autoimmune optic neuropathy, chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), idiopathic recurrent neuro retinitis, &amp; optic neuropathy from systemic disease. This case report describes the occurrence of idiopathic optic neuritis that coexists with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) as a possibility of chronic relapsing optic neuropathy. Case description: A 39-year-old man with atypical optic neuritis due to idiopathic accompanied by CSCR in the right eye complained of sudden blurry vision with darkening of the lower visual field since 2 weeks &amp; sudden worsening for 1 week prior to hospitalization. Eye examination showed visual acuity 1/300 in the right eye, grade III relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), round optic nerve head with blurred demarcation &amp; undetermined cup disc ratio, and macular imaging examination showed CSCR. Perimetric examination revealed nonspecific. Idiopathic optic neuritis was treated with optic neuritis trial treatment for 4 days while CSC was observed. The results of the evaluation showed that visual acuity and CSC had improved. Idiopathic optic neuritis accompanied by the presence of CSCR can be managed &amp; managed with a fairly good outcome. Conclusion: In this case, the patient with atypical optic neuritis of idiopathic etiology accompanied by central serous chorioretinopathy in the right eye demonstrates a fairly favorable response to the administered corticosteroids.

The clinical course and outcome of a persistent vegetative state depend on its cause. Post-traumatic unawareness persisting for more than a month should not be considered an irreversible condition, because an outcome that might be regarded by some as being acceptable is possible even in patients with very severe brain damage. Recovery of consciousness from a posttraumatic persistent vegetative state is unlikely after 12 months in adults and children. For most such patients, life expectancy ranges from 2 to 5 years; survival beyond 10 years is unusual. Corpus callosum and dorsolateral brainstem lesions are highly significant in predicting nonrecovery. Long-term prognosis of post-traumatic vegetative state (VS) remains poorly defined. Essential prognostic factors of VS include threat blink reflex presence, ventricular dilatation, brainstem and corpus callosal injury; motor score (Glasgow Coma Score) and presence of spontaneous eye movements.",

Cases with severe COVID-19 are more likely to be complicated by neurological symptoms, but tonic non-colonic convulsion is still a rare presentation of COVID19 as an initial symptom. A 23-years old male presented to the ambulance with a complaint of loss of consciousness for more than 1 h and tonic convulsions without clonic movements. The investigations including computed tomography for the brain and chest and lumbar puncture were within normal range and the diagnostic workup concluded that COVID-19 is the cause of the status epilepticus. Our case demonstrates a tonic non-clonic convulsion as a possible complication for COVID-19 infection as some respiratory viruses can cause neurological symptoms. After excluding the co-incidence of other pathological etiologies, we highly suspect that the seizures in our case are generated by COVID-19 infection. This case represents a rare case in the literature review which can increase the awareness of tonic non-clonic seizures and other neurological manifestations as the presenting symptom of the COVID19.",

Peripheral neuropathy resulting from the neurotoxic effects of HIV itself and the medications used to treat HIV were widely considered the primary cause of acute and chronic pain early on in the antiretroviral treatment era. However, recent studies suggest a predominance of non-neuropathic (e.g., musculoskeletal) pain in PWH with uncertain etiology. Chronic pain is often widespread in PWH, affecting multiple body locations. Additional research is needed to better understand contributors to chronic pain in PWH, which is likely to include biological (e.g., immune dysregulation), psychological (e.g., substance abuse) and social (e.g., stigma) factors.",

      "abstract": "We have presented a case of a male homosexual with documented acquired immune deficiency syndrome in whom sudden sensorineural hearing loss developed after a series of opportunistic infections and before a massive intracerebral hemorrhage. Two major possible causes of his hearing loss are (1) actual involvement of spiral ganglion or acoustic division of the eighth cranial nerve by HTLV III virus, or (2) cryptococcal meningitis. He ultimately died after a series of neurological complications developed. These complications, which are common in patients with AIDS, include progressive dementia, obtundation, and coma. As the number of patients with AIDS in our society increases over the next 5 years, it will become more important for the otolaryngologist to recognize the complications of this disease that involve the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is one of these complications. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome, at this point, might best be treated by an approach of preventive medicine. However, such an approach would have far-reaching social and political implications--perhaps more so than in other venereally spread diseases. In the interim, the otolaryngologist-head and neck specialist is required to recognize AIDS as it manifests itself in the head and neck. In this case, sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss was the otolaryngologic presentation of the AIDS.",

      "abstract": "Neurotrophic support of developing neurons by neurotrophins is of critical importance in the development of fungiform papillae and taste buds. A number of neurological disorders show a decrease or increase in fungiform papillae or taste sensation. These can be grouped into disorders with reduced papillae (Machado-Joseph disease, Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome, familial dysautonomia, dystonia musculorum, and Behçet's disease) and those with taste defects only (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, and diabetes mellitus). In addition, Parkinson's disease results in increased taste sensation. Here, we hypothesize that the main problem in these disorders is either not enough or too much neurotrophic support. Proneurotrophic drugs such as some antidepressants and aldose reductase inhibitors may prove useful in the treatment of these sensory and central nervous system disorders. Similarly, antineurotrophic drugs may also be useful in Parkinson's disease. Here we show that the protein involved in familial dysautonomia, IKAP, localizes to keratin filaments in HeLa cells, suggesting a role for the keratin cytoskeleton in neurotrophic support.

We report two patients with hemichorea-hemiballism (HC-HB) or partial motor seizures as the first manifestation of NKH. These disorders are best treated with insulin and rehydration. The neurological symptoms generally resolve with the correction of hyperglycemia. Antiepileptic treatment, especially phenytoin, is usually futile and even aggravates hyperglycemia. The exact mechanisms of how NKH causes focal neurological symptoms are unknown. One hypothesis is related to the depletion of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is metabolized in the brain as an energy source in NKH. The deficiency of GABA in the basal ganglia may lead to HC-HB, while in the cerebral cortex it may lower the seizure threshold. Another hypothesis involves transient focal cerebral ischemia caused by hyperglycemia. Therefore we should not overlook NKH as a cause of focal neurological symptoms. Rapid recognition of their association will allow for prompt and correct treatment.",

In Human rabies can present as either the encephalitic (furious) or paralytic (dumb) forms. Despite the fact that there are no outward symptoms of brainstem dysfunction, the brainstem is predominantly engaged in both clinical types. Clinical variation may be explained by variations in tropism at the site of inoculation or the CNS, in the path of propagation, or in the induction of immune cascades in the brainstem. Rabies still presents diagnostic challenges, particularly in its paralytic form, which closely resembles with Guillain-Barre syndrome very closely, or when a patient is unconscious and the cardinal indications may not be present. Prior to demise, rabies virus RNA may be reliably found in bodily fluids or tissue before a person passes away using molecular techniques.

      "abstract": "<h3>Summary</h3> Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders – most commonly occurring in childhood – characterized by progressive, widespread neurodegeneration and intra-neuronal accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments. Adult-onset NCL (also referred to as Kufs disease) is the rarest entity of this group, with an incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 worldwide. The clinical presentation of Kufs disease involves any combination of progressive dementia, epilepsy, myoclonus, cerebellar and/or extrapyramidal signs. Behavioural changes are also common and visual loss is infrequent; however, the condition invariably leads to death within 15 years of the onset of symptoms. The diagnostic challenges posed by patients with Kufs disease are two-fold. Firstly, their clinical presentation can mimic several other rare causes of progressive myoclonic epilepsy or dementia with motor deterioration. Secondly, unlike other forms of NCL, extra-neural accumulation of the hallmark lipopigments is unreliable for confirming a diagnosis of Kufs disease. This diagnosis is most reliably confirmed by invasive brain biopsy. Mutations in the DNAJC5 gene, which has a key role in synaptic transmission, are a known cause of autosomal dominant Kufs disease. This gene encodes for cysteine string protein (CSP-α), which is located on pre-synaptic vesicles and enables the formation of SNARE-complexes – the key mediators of pre-synaptic vesicular fusion and exocytosis at the synaptic cleft. Causative mutations reduce synaptic levels of CSP-α, therefore impairing synaptic transmission. This presentation will describe the clinical features and genetic analysis of a patient diagnosed with autosomal dominant Kufs disease in the UK. Undergraduate prize.",

Pathological findings in SSPE brain include diffuse encephalitis of both gray and white matter and cerebral and brainstem structures. SSPE begins in childhood or adolescence mental and behavioral regression is the most frequent initial manifestation, along with apathy, irritability, and sometimes psychosis. Definitive diagnosis based on clinical presentation and demonstration of high titers of measles virus antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obviates brain biopsy. High signal intensity lesions on T2-weighted images involving periventricular and subcortical white matter are the most common finding. Electroencephalography (EEG) is helpful in diagnosis, depending on the stage of disease. SSPE is fatal within 2-3 years after onset in 95% of cases. Other viruses that can cause chronic progressive panencephalitis are rubella virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and HIV.",

      "abstract": ": There is an increasing number of patients worldwide with sleep disturbances and diabetes. Various sleep disorders, including long or short sleep duration and poor sleep quality of numerous causes, may increase the risk of diabetes. Some symptoms of diabetes, such as painful peripheral neuropathy and nocturia, or associated other sleep disorders, such as sleep breathing disorders or sleep movement disorders, may influence sleep quality and quantity. Both sleep disorders and diabetes may lead to cognitive impairment. The risk of development of cognitive impairment in diabetic patients may be related to vascular and non-vascular and other factors, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central insulin resistance, amyloid and tau deposits and other causes. Numerous sleep disorders, e.g., sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, and poor sleep quality are most likely are also associated with cognitive impairment. Adequate functioning of the system of clearance of the brain from toxic substances, such as amyloid β, i.e. glymphatic system, is related to undisturbed sleep and prevents cognitive impairment. In the case of coexistence, sleep disturbances and diabetes either independently lead to and/or mutually aggravate cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "title": "La démence associée à la sclérose hippocampique : une nouvelle variété de démence frontotemporale ?",
      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Florence Mahieux La sclerose hippocampique (SH) designe une perte de neurones au niveau de l’hippocampe, accompagnee d’une proliferation de cellules gliales. Une SH est frequemment observee lors d’interventions chirurgicales pour epilepsie temporale, mais aussi apres traumatisme crânien, hypoglycemie severe ou arret cardiaque prolonge. Sa presence lors de l’examen neuropathologique de malades dements est signalee depuis de nombreuses annees, au cours de diverses maladies (maladie d’Alzheimer, demence avec corps de Lewy, ou demences dites « sans signe histopathologique distinct ») et, beaucoup plus rarement, de facon isolee (SH « pure ») [1]. Sa frequence varie, selon les series, de 0,4 % a 8 %. La notion de SH « pure » est sujette a discussion en temps qu’entite specifique et n’est pas definie par tous de la meme facon (essentiellement selon le degre de « purete » de l’atteinte). Les tableaux cliniques (succinctement) decrits peuvent etre similaires a ceux d’une maladie d’Alzheimer comme d’une demence frontotemporale. L’origine hypoxique (vasculaire) ou non de cette lesion est egalement l’objet de constatations contradictoires. Deux articles recents offrent une nouvelle piste a notre reflexion, explorant successivement, selon l’angle neurologique et neuropathologique, une serie de 19 cas de SH « pure », issus de la banque de cerveaux de l’hopital John Hopkins de Baltimore, constituee entre 1985 et 2002 [2, 3]. Il faut cependant noter que les dossiers cliniques prealables pouvaient provenir d’unites hospitalieres differentes et ont ete recueillies retrospectivement. Ces cas ont ete compares, pour les donnees cliniques, a 24 cas de demence frontotemporale (DFT) anatomiquement definie, incluant les differentes variantes connues de ce syndrome et 19 cas de maladie d’Alzheimer (MA), apparies pour l’âge, le sexe et l’âge de debut des symptomes. Globalement, la frequence et le spectre des troubles comportementaux des SH etaient similaires a ceux du groupe des DFT (plus grande frequence de l’incurie et des comportements stereotypes, alors que l’apathie, les hallucinations et l’agressivite etaient plus frequents dans la MA). Les troubles neuropsychologiques differenciaient egalement les groupes : la desorientation, les troubles du calcul et l’agnosie etant plus particulierement le fait de la MA. L’apraxie etait significativement plus rare dans la SH, mais le mutisme y etait nettement plus frequent que pour les deux autres groupes. Les troubles de memoire etaient particulierement mal decrits (probablement du fait de la provenance tres diverse des cas), ce qui represente tres clairement une des faiblesses de l’etude. L’analyse en aveugle des dossiers cliniques par un groupe de cliniciens a montre que 57 % des cas de SH etaient compatibles avec un diagnostic de DFT (repartis pour moitie en DFT pure probable et DFT / possible MA). Dans les groupes controles choisis, la sensibilite des criteres cliniques etait de 64 % et la specificite de 74 % ; 1/19 patients MA etant classe comme DFT pure probable et 5 patients du groupe des DFT etant classes comme MA probable et/ou possible.  Le deuxieme article correspondait a une analyse neuropathologique plus poussee de 18 des 19 cas de SH. Chez 11 d’entre eux ont ete retrouvees des inclusions neuronales ubiquitine-positive, generalement considerees comme caracteristiques des demences associees aux atteintes du motoneurone (en rappelant que tous les intermediaires possibles entre SLA cliniquement pure et demence sans atteinte clinique motrice ont ete decrits avec ce type de lesions [4]). La comparaison des patients ayant ces inclusions avec ceux qui en etaient depourvus n’a pas permis de mettre en evidence la moindre specificite clinique. La mesure de la proteine tau, aussi bien sous sa forme soluble (diminuee dans un certain nombre de cas de demence « sans caractere histopathologique distinct ») que sous sa forme insoluble (elevee dans la MA), n’a mis en evidence aucune difference avec les controles.  L’ensemble de ces deux articles suggere que les SH « pures » pourraient s’agglutiner au groupe grandissant des DFT, malgre l’absence de toute anomalie de la proteine tau (elles n’appartiendraient donc pas au cadre des tauopathies). Un certain nombre d’entre elles pourraient relever de la meme etiologie que les demences « associees aux atteintes du motoneurone », sans que ce sous-groupe puisse etre mieux defini. L’origine des troubles cliniques de type frontal n’est par ailleurs pas expliquee, meme si les auteurs avancent l’hypothese d’une deafferentation du cortex orbitofrontal liee a l’atteinte des projections de l’hippocampe.  Ces etudes soulignent par ailleurs la grande difficulte du diagnostic etiologique des demences sur les seules donnees cliniques, un meme syndrome pouvant relever de pathologies tres differentes ayant une meme repartition spatiale. 1.

      "title": "Pharmacological Interventions for Cognitive Dysfunction in Major Depressive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, chronic, and recurring mental disorder, which is frequently accompanied by co-occurring mental and somatic illnesses. Compelling evidence indicates that patients with MDD exhibit cognitive impairment encompassing several domains, including but not limited to, executive function, verbal memory, and attention. In addition, cognitive impairment may be evident even during remission and appears to play a major role in the persistence of psychosocial dysfunction (including impairment in workforce). Therefore, several compounds have been tested as putative cognitive enhancers for MDD. Although antidepressant treatment may be associated with modest improvements in some cognitive domains (namely psychomotor speed and delayed recall), evidence thus far remains unclear owing to methodological limitations across clinical trials. These methodological limitations include: (i) lack of adequate screening for cognitive dysfunction at baseline; (ii) the inclusion of samples that were not in remission at baseline; pseudospecificity (i.e. observed effects on cognition could be due to secondary improvement in mood); (iii) cognitive function was not the primary outcome in some trials; and (iv) lack of standardization of cognitive measures employed across studies. Replicated evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicates that vortioxetine and duloxetine may have procognitive effects. Furthermore, data from RCTs suggest that lisdexamfetamine, modafinil, metformin, and erythropoietin may also have beneficial cognitive effects. In conclusion, the achievement of cognitive remission remains an unmet goal in the treatment of MDD. Future research directions, including methodological improvements in the conduct of RCTs targeting MDD-related cognitive dysfunction, are discussed.",

According to the etiology, risk factors, and manifestations, Stages I and II DEP largely corresponds to moderate VCI; Stage III DEP does to severe VCI. The results of the author’s studies show that a considerable proportion of patients followed up with a diagnosis of CCI, DEP, have no signs of chronic cerebrovascular disease (CVD), but suffer from primary or secondary headache, vertigo of various origins, emotional disorders, and other diseases. The diagnosis of CCI, DEP should be based on the presence of CCI, the reliable neuroimaging signs of chronic CVD, and the ruling out of other diseases. When treating and preventing VCI, CCI, and DEP, a premium is placed upon both non-drug (regular physical activity, smoking cessation, rational nutrition) and drug therapy aimed at normalizing blood pressure and blood lipid spectrum, preventing blood clots, and improving cognitive functions.",

However, delays in treatment can be costly both in terms of hospital resources and patient outcomes.

Few cases of NMS in the intubated polytrauma patient have been described in the literature previously.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The second most frequently affected organ in mitochondrial disorders (MIDs) is the central nervous system (CNS). One of the most frequent CNS abnormalities on imaging is the affection of the white matter (WMLs) for which the term, leukoencephalopathies in mitochondrial disorders (LEM), is proposed. The morphology of LEM on imaging is quite variable even within the same type of MID and the same family. LEM can be a subtle or prominent feature on imaging and may go along with or without clinical neurologic or neuropsychological manifestations. WMLs are most likely due to the underlying metabolic defect of the respiratory chain or concomitant oxidative stress, resulting in neuronal death and replacement of neurons by glial cells. WMLs in MIDs frequently give rise to misinterpretation, particularly if the mitochondrial defect is not evident in organs other than the CNS or if the presence of WMLs does not induce consideration of a MID as a differential. The diagnosis of a LEM requires the diagnosis of an MID, the detection of WMLs on imaging, and the exclusion of all possible differentials. Because the presence of LEM has an impact on the prognosis of an MID, all MID patients should undergo cerebral imaging even in the absence of clinical CNS manifestations.",

The ability to recognise CNS infections, whilst less common than other infections, is crucial in the refugee setting. There are large refugee populations at risk of these infections. For example, in a number of refugee settlements within the African ‘meningitis belt’ there is a risk of epidemics of meningococcal disease. Conditions in refugee settlements can also increase risk of transmission, such as overcrowding and poor hygiene. Infections of the CNS can be rapidly fatal, so urgent treatment and appropriate referral is required. Although there are a variety of different CNS pathogens, they often cause similar presenting symptoms, such as fever, headache, meningism, reduced level of consciousness and seizures, and it can, therefore, be very difficult to confirm the underlying cause outside of secondary care. For this reason, if a CNS infection is suspected following clinical assessment, the patient must be transferred as soon as possible to the nearest secondary care facility. The focus in this chapter is on meningitis, encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.",

      "title": "Acute Viral Encephalitis",
      "abstract": "Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are uncommon but potentially devastating clinical events. As a group, these infections range from benign, self-limited forms of meningitis to full-blown and often fatal cases of acute encephalitis to chronic, persistent diseases. Encephalitis literally refers to inflammation of the brain parenchyma, and such a host response is common with many viral infections that spread to this site (Figure 75.1). In contrast, meningitis results when infection and the associated inflammatory response are limited to the leptomeninges and the subarachnoid space. In reality, the two syndromes often occur together—hence the term meningoencephalitis. Acute viral encephalitis or acute viral meningoencephalitis is suggested by various signs and symptoms indicative of brain parenchymal invasion (mental status and behavioral changes, seizures, and focal neurological deficits) accompanied by fever. Such patients require emergent evaluation for what can be a life-threatening infectious illness that sometimes has a treatable cause.",

We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

      "abstract": "Mitchell AJ, Kemp S, Benito-León J, Reuber M. The influence of cognitive impairment on health-related quality of life in neurological disease. Background: Cognitive impairment is the most consistent neurological complication of acquired and degenerative brain disorders. Historically, most focus was on dementia but now has been broadened to include the important construct of mild cognitive impairment. Methods: Systematic search and review of articles linked quality of life (QoL) and cognitive complications of neurological disorders. We excluded QoL in dementia. Results: Our search identified 249 publications. Most research examined patients with brain tumours, stroke, epilepsy, head injury, Huntington's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Results suggested that the majority of patients with epilepsy, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and head injury have subtle cognitive deficits early in their disease course. These cognitive complaints are often overlooked by clinicians. In many cases, the cognitive impairment is progressive but it can also be relapsing-remitting and in some cases reversible. Despite the importance of severe cognitive impairment in the form of dementia, there is now increasing recognition of a broad spectrum of impairment, including those with subclinical or mild cognitive impairment. Even mild cognitive difficulties can have functional and psychiatric consequences–especially when they are persistent and untreated. Specific cognitive deficits such an inattention, dysexecutive function and processing speed may affect a number of quality of life (QoL) domains. For example, cognitive impairment influences return to work, interpersonal relationships and leisure activities. In addition, fear of future cognitive decline may also impact upon QoL. Conclusions: We recommend further development of simple tools to screen for cognitive impairments in each neurological condition. We also recommend that a thorough cognitive assessment should be a part of routine clinical practice in those caring for individuals with neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

Soon after admission there were vague paranoid delusions. Initially, the cognitive state was impossible to access, but cognitive deficit was later demonstrated using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Although there was no clear evid??ence of delirium, the MMSE score subsequently improved, as did the disinhibited behaviour.Results: CT revealed no abnormality.

      "abstract": "Pruritus, better known as itch, is ‘an unpleasant cutaneous sensation provoking the desire to scratch’.1 It is typically caused by pruritogens that activate nerve endings in cutaneous and transitional tissues (eg, conjunctivae, anal mucosa) and serves a protective function against noxious stimuli.\n\nItch can also occur with diseased or malfunctioning pruritogenic neurones in the absence of a pruritogen—a symptom termed neuropathic pruritus or neuropathic itch.2 Neuropathic pruritus is a well described but under-recognised symptom of neurological disorders. The site of involvement may be (i) peripheral nerve and root, (ii) spinal cord or (iii) brain. It may accompany a variety of peripheral and central neurological disorders, including postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome, multiple sclerosis and stroke.3\n\nNeuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory astrocytopathic disorder affecting predominantly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is associated with antiaquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) in up to 70% of patients. Spinal cord involvement typically presents as a longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis with associated sensorimotor and sphincter dysfunction. Sensory symptoms such as numbness, dysaesthesia, pain and tonic spasms are common.4 This report highlights neuropathic pruritus as an under-recognised feature of neuromyelitis optica.\n\nA 45-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with a 4-day history of unexplained nausea, vomiting, hiccup and vertigo. On the fourth day, she developed bilateral forearm itching. Over the following 3 days, she developed rapidly progressive weakness from the chest down, ultimately resulting in complete paraplegia, sensory loss and loss of both bladder and bowel function. She also developed weakness in both arms, worse on the left side.\n\nShe was admitted 3 days after the onset of her nausea and vomiting, which subsided a day later. However, the itching …",

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations can lead to complications, including post-acute COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PACVS). There has been no report of a patient with PACVS presenting with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), myocarditis/pericarditis, immunodeficiency, or coagulopathy after the second BNT162b2 dose. The patient is a 51-year-old woman with chronic myopericarditis, coagulopathy due to factor-VIII increase and protein-S deficiency, GBS, and a number of other ocular, dermatological, immunological, and central nervous system abnormalities related to the second dose of the BNT172b2 vaccine. GBS manifested with mild, multiple cranial nerve lesions, small fibre neuropathy (SFN) affecting the autonomic system with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and orthostatic hypotension, and sensory disturbances in the upper and lower limbs. PACVS was diagnosed months after onset, but despite the delayed diagnosis, the patient benefited from glucocorticoids, repeated HELP apheresis, and multiple symptomatic treatments. The case shows that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be complicated by PACVS manifesting as chronic myopericarditis, coagulopathy, GBS with predominant dysautonomia, and impaired immune competence, and that diagnosis of PACVS can be delayed for months. Delayed diagnosis of PACVS may result in a delay in appropriate treatment and the prolongation of disabling symptoms. Patients and physicians should be made aware of PACVS to improve diagnostic and therapeutic management in terms of patient and healthcare system costs.",

Recent findings Inherited myopathies, such as dysferlinopathy, calpainopathy, and facioscapulohumeral dystrophy may be misdiagnosed as autoimmune myopathy, especially when they have inflammatory muscle biopsies. Inclusion body myositis is frequently misdiagnosed as polymyositis when rimmed vacuoles are absent on muscle biopsy, and a careful neuromuscular evaluation is not performed. Hypothyroid myopathy can be misdiagnosed as immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy if thyroid function tests, including a T4 level, are not obtained. Self-limited statin myopathy can be distinguished from statin-associated autoimmune myopathy because patients with the former do not have autoantibodies recognizing 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Summary Autoimmune myopathies can usually be distinguished from nonautoimmune myopathies based on a combination of the patient history, neuromuscular exam, laboratory findings, and/or muscle biopsy features.",

Ataxia is the commonest neurological manifestation, followed by peripheral neuropathy. Epilepsy, headache, encephalopathy, various movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and muscle disorders have also been linked to gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease and are discussed in this review. Strict gluten-free diet is an effective first-line treatment of the neurological manifestations of gluten-related disorders. Very few patients will require additional immunosuppressive treatment usually in the form of mycophenolate.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric lupus, also known as neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), is a subset of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that affects the central nervous system, leading to a range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.It occurs in approximately 25-75% of SLE patients, varying prevalence across populations.NPSLE primarily affects women of childbearing age but can occur in individuals of any age or gender, with a higher prevalence among non-Caucasian populations and those with severe SLE symptoms.The exact cause of NPSLE is complex, involving immune dysregulation, autoantibody production, and central nervous system inflammation.Autoantibodies, such as anti-phospholipid and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, may significantly affect neurological symptoms.Immune-complex deposition and proinflammatory cytokines within the brain contribute to the disease's pathophysiology.NPSLE encompasses many symptoms, including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, psychosis, seizures, and headaches.Diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and autoantibody testing.A multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, neurologists, and psychiatrists is often necessary.Treatment for NPSLE is tailored to the specific symptoms and their severity.It typically involves immunosuppressive therapies like corticosteroids, diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and sometimes biological agents.Adjunctive therapies, including antiepileptic drugs, antipsychotics, and antidepressants, may be necessary for symptom management.Regular monitoring and follow-up are crucial to assess treatment response.The article discusses the epidemiology of SLE and NPSLE, emphasizing the variability in prevalence across different populations.It highlights the challenges in diagnosing NPSLE due to its diverse and often nonspecific symptoms.Various diagnostic criteria and biomarkers are discussed, emphasizing the need for a personalized diagnostic approach.The article also covers the differential diagnosis of NPSLE, distinguishing it from other autoimmune diseases, infections, and medication-induced symptoms.Regarding prognosis, NPSLE is associated with a poorer quality of life and increased mortality compared to SLE without neuropsychiatric involvement.Specific factors, such as anti-ribosomal P antibodies and acute confusional states, are linked to worse outcomes.Mortality in NPSLE is often due to infections.Neuropsychiatric lupus is a complex condition characterized by neurological and psychiatric symptoms.Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are essential to improve outcomes and the quality of life for patients with NPSLE.Further research is needed to understand its pathogenesis and improve diagnostic and treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease: Is the Adaptive Immune System a Friend or Foe?",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterised by progressive neuronal death and neurological dysfunction, leading to increased disability and a loss of cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have neurodegeneration as a primary feature. However, in other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, neurodegeneration follows another insult, such as demyelination or ischaemia. Although there are different primary causes to these diseases, they all share a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can occur through the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia, cells of the innate and adaptive peripheral immune system, meningeal inflammation and autoantibodies directed towards components of the CNS. Despite chronic inflammation being pathogenic in these diseases, local inflammation after insult can also promote endogenous regenerative processes in the CNS, which are key to slowing disease progression. The normal ageing process in the healthy brain is associated with a decline in physiological function, a steady increase in levels of neuroinflammation, brain shrinkage and memory deficits. Likewise, ageing is also a key contributor to the progression and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. As there are associated co-morbidities within an ageing population, pinpointing the precise relationship between ageing and neurodegenerative disease progression can be a challenge. The CNS has historically been considered an isolated, \"immune privileged\" site, however there is mounting evidence that adaptive immune cells are present in the CNS of both healthy individuals and diseased patients. Adaptive immune cells have also been implicated in both the degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. In this review, we will discuss the key role of the adaptive immune system in CNS degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on how ageing influences this crosstalk.",

In the last decade, the concept of limbic encephalitis has expanded apart from any paraneoplastic aetiology, it may occur as an infectious or autoimmune disorder (that may or may not be associated with antineuronal antibodies). Due to its various non-specific symptoms, early diagnosis of limbic encephalitis is frequently difficult. The first reported case, a 53-year-old female, presented with short-term memory loss, and was treated initially for Alzheimer`s disease, later developing tyipcal symptoms of limbic encephalitis with rapid alteration of consciousness, accompanied by seizures and discrete temporal lobe signal change on MRI and abnormal increase of antibodies against voltage-gated potassium channels confirmed a diagnosis of limbic encephalitis. Both cases improved after corticosteroid therapy. No paraneoplastic origin was found in either case. We discuss the most usual signs and symptoms of limbic encephalitis, focusing on recent classification, diagnostics and treatment of this often under-diagnosed disorder.",

This narrative review aims to summarise recent advances in the nature, frequency, management, and outcome of neurological side effects from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. CNS disorders triggered by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include headache, cerebro-vascular disorders (venous sinus thrombosis [VST], ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid bleeding, reversible, cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, vasculitis, pituitary apoplexy, Susac syndrome), inflammatory diseases (encephalitis, meningitis, demyelinating disorders, transverse myelitis), epilepsy, and a number of other rarely reported CNS conditions. PNS disorders related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include neuropathy of cranial nerves, mono-/polyradiculitis (Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS]), Parsonage-Turner syndrome (plexitis), small fiber neuropathy, myasthenia, myositis/dermatomyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and a number of other conditions. The most common neurological side effects are facial palsy, intracerebral hemorrhage, VST, and GBS. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but several speculations have been generated to explain the development of CNS/PNS disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In conclusion, neurological side effects develop with any type of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and are diverse, can be serious and even fatal, and should be taken seriously to initiate early treatment and improve outcome and avoid fatalities.",

Доведено, що причинами невротичних розладів уважаються психічні травми та невротичні конфлікти, що викликають реакції стресу і дистресу, внаслідок чого відбувається дезорганізація організму (неадекватні, неспецифічні реакції) на всіх рівнях (фізіологічному, психологічному, поведінковому), що призводить до психосоматичних порушень і навіть захворювань. У статті висвітлено два види соціально-психологічної адаптації: прогресивний, який забезпечує реалізацію узгодженості інтересів і цілей індивідів і груп суспільства; регресивний, що постає як формальне пристосування, несумісне з інтересами суспільства і розвитком цієї соціальної групи і самої особистості. Представлені результати емпіричного дослідження прояву невротизації особистості: виявлено, що в 19% респондентів спостерігається низький рівень прояву невротизації, у 40% – середній рівень і ще у 41% – високий. Тобто можна зробити висновок, що 81% студентів мають підвищений або високий рівень невротизації, що впливає на якість їхнього життя та здоров’я. Запропоновані підходи до лікування передбачають поєднання терапії, медикаментів і підтримки для вирішення як соціально-психологічних, так і невротичних аспектів, спрямованих на покращення загального благополуччя та адаптивного функціонування.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders accompanying digestive system diseases constitute interdisciplinary yet scarcely acknowledged both diagnostic and therapeutic problem. One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

      "abstract": "An illustrative case of diffuse axonal injury (DAI) emphasizes features that help to separate focal outer head trauma owing to blows and/or falls from angular acceleration head injuries associated with diffuse inner brain lesions. In the past, explaining significant neurological deficits and death as the result of diffuse closed head trauma received from high-speed automobile accidents has been difficult as well as confusing. The long-term consequences from such diffuse inner cerebral trauma are still poorly defined. Head injuries sustained in automobile accidents have been associated with diffuse brain damage characterized by axonal injury at the moment of impact. The reported victim of a motor vehicle accident showed post-mortem findings for both inner cerebral trauma and focal outer cerebral damage. The diffuse degeneration of cerebral white matter is associated with sagittal and lateral acceleration with centroaxial trauma and has a different pathogenesis from outer focal head trauma, typified by subdural hematomas and coup injuries. Unlike outer cerebral injury, over 50 percent of victims with diffuse axonal injury die within two weeks. These individuals characteristically have no lucid interval and remain unconscious, vegetative, or severely disabled until death. Compared to head trauma victims without diffuse axonal injury, there is a lower incidence of skull fractures, subdural hemorrhages, or other intracranial mass effect as well as outer brain contusions. Primary brainstem injuries often demonstrated at autopsy are seen in the reported victim. Diffuse axonal injury is produced by various angles of acceleration with prolonged acceleration/deceleration usually accompanying traffic accidents. Less severe diffuse axonal injury causes concussion.",

Infection is caused by ingestion of the eggs of the tapeworm, excreted with the feces of an infected human tapeworm carrier. The majority of cysticercosis cases are in older children and young adults, presenting as a single degenerating intraparenchymal lesion. Another particular clinical setting associated with seizures is the occurrence of perilesional edema around a dead, calcified parasite. The primary diagnostic approach when neurocysticercosis is suspected is the use of brain imaging. The differential diagnosis of a single brain enhancing lesion is problematic. Treatment of epilepsy secondary to NCC follows standard guidelines for the management of any other secondary epilepsies. Neurocysticercosis is rarely associated with refractory seizures, and first-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) usually achieve good seizure control.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 is a highly contagious viral illness that has claimed millions of lives worldwide. Since its emergence, it has exerted a negative impact on many sectors globally without the exception of frontline COVID-19 healthcare providers. Specifically, in frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers, occupational stress-related sleep disorders such as insomnia and daytime somnolence have been extensively reported and were characterized by neuro-immunological changes. However, the possible mechanisms that underlie the sleep disorders have not been elucidated. The review was designed to highlight possible sleep mechanisms responsible for insomnia and daytime somnolence reported in frontline COVID-19 health workers. Available evidence shows that emotional perturbation, hypertension, chronobiological disruption and prolonged exposure to artificial light are among the events orchestrating occupational-stress-related sleep disorders in frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers. Anxiety-associated sleep anomaly is attributable to stimulation of the reticular activating system which occurs as a result of activation of noradrenergic fiber and sympatho-adrenal axis. Another mechanism includes depletion of hippocampal and brain glycogen by anxiety-induced activation of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting brain neurons and hypothalamic-corticotropic-adrenal cortex axis. Spontaneous discharge of noradrenergic fiber during basal state and changes in normal secretory rhythm of hypnosis-related chemical messengers may be responsible for hypertension- and chronobiological disruption-induced sleep disorders, respectively. Lastly, prolonged light exposure-induced suppression of melatonin secretion may elicit disruption of normal circadian sleep.",

Best seen on MRI, these lesions occur in both deep gray and white matter (WM) and are most often commingled with varying degrees of WM hyperintensity (WMH), further complicating the matter. Subcortical lacunes and WMH have been linked with vascular cognitive impairment, a concept that is evolving1; further, when severe, these findings suggest the diagnosis of subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.2 However, the relative contribution of lacunes and WMHs to cognitive decline is controversial. Whereas the clinical relevance of lacunes to motor and sensory syndromes is widely accepted,3 the degree to which cerebral lacunes affect cognitive function has been less clear. Dementia associated with multiple lacunes—the etat lacunaire of Pierre Marie4—has been recognized for over a century, but the cognitive dysfunction resulting from one or a few lacunes is often considered negligible.3 Further consideration of this question is warranted, based on the evidence that even a single WM lacune …",

In the acute stage, the seizures did not respond to conventional antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid, phenytoin, and topiramate. The clinical course was complicated by the development of acute psychosis, including bipolar mood, insomnia, agitation, and hallucinations. The diagnosis of HE was supported by positive results for antithyroperoxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies. Treatment with methylprednisolone was effective; her psychosis improved and the number of seizures decreased. HE is a serious but curable, condition, which might be underdiagnosed if not suspected. Anti-thyroid antibodies must be measured for the diagnosis. HE should be considered in patients with diverse neuropsychiatric manifestations.",

      "abstract": "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute peripheral neuropathy that develops as a result of post-infectious immune-mediated nerve injury. It can be classified into classic and variant GBS. Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is a subtype of GBS with the key clinical features of pure motor weakness, areflexia, absence of sensory symptoms, and lack of neurophysiologic evidence of demyelination. We reported a case of acute motor axonal neuropathy in association with hepatitis E infection. A young woman was referred to us after a period of nausea, fever, and diarrhea. She had unexplained muscle weakness at admission and has been diagnosed with acute hepatitis E infection. A rigorous clinical neurological assessment revealed bilateral symmetrical weakness, which affects the lower limbs more than the upper limbs, with no evidence of sensory involvement. Neurophysiological measurements indicated acute axonal injury without clues to demyelination. A diagnosis of acute motor axonal neuropathy subtype has been made, to which she only received supportive therapy. The symptoms resolved spontaneously and full recovery of motor function was attained after 35 days of weakness onset with complete normalization of neurophysiologic parameters.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Myopathy in critical care complicates the course of the primary critical illness by significantly potentiating patient morbidity in intensive care units (ICU). The development of this rare but serious complication poses a potential threat of progression to respiratory paralysis if not promptly diagnosed and optimally managed. This disorder has been reported to affect as many as 43% of critically debilitated patients in the intensive care unit. Patient's age, body mass index, comorbid illnesses, the severity of the primary disease, multisystemic organ dysfunction, exposure to neurotoxic and myotoxic drugs, and prolonged immobility are among the significant risk factors for this condition. The pathophysiological process that underlies this spectrum of secondary muscular paralysis is multifactorial and complex to comprehend. This is subdivided into critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), and critical illness neuromyopathy (CINM), depending on the various structural and functional alterations of myofibers and neurons that underlie these disorders. Fortunately, this functionally crippling clinical condition is amenable to a few feasible preventive medical practices and is under continuous scrutiny in current neurocritical care research. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion of the recent insights into the different constituents of ICU-acquired weakness, their varied clinical presentations, detailed panel for their diagnostic workup, differential diagnosis of other clinical mimics, prognostication, short- and long-term repercussions, and the key preventive and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "prognosis • unresponsive wakefulness syndrome Causes of development of severe disorders of consciousnessHypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage and brain infarction are common causes of mortality and morbidity [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].Many patients affected by these acquired brain injuries (ABIs) die in the acute stages during their stay in the intensive care unit; others, after a coma phase, usually develop a severe disorder of consciousness (DoC), characterized by an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or a minimally conscious state (MCS).In some cases, consciousness level improves, transitioning to an emergence from MCS (E-MCS); however, patients with E-MCS often show a severe neurological disability [9].In recent years, improvements both in intensive care technology and in neurosurgical procedures have reduced the mortality rate; however, as a result, many patients discharged from the acute setting exhibit severe DoCs. Neurological prognosis of patients with disorders of consciousnessPredicting the neurological outcome in a patient with severe DoC is an important goal in the acute stages after ABI [10], mainly for two reasons: first, the appropriate therapeutic management among the intensive care units can be better identified, and second, a patient who needs further multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment compared with a patient who should be addressed to a long-term care after hospital discharge, can be better identified [6,7].However, establishing the neurological prognosis in postacute stages, when patients are already admitted to the intensive rehabilitation units (IRUs), is also important for individualized multidisciplinary rehabilitation planning, in view of realistic expectations of a patient's recovery and for assisting physicians in communicating with the patient's family members and caregivers.However, in contrast to the literature about the acute stages, there are no strong data about the long-term neurological prognosis in patients already admitted to the IRUs.In fact, to date, only a few studies [9,11] have analyzed postacute clinical or instrumental predictors for late neurological prognosis, showing some limitations and conflicting results.One of the main reasons for the lack of postacute robust neurological predictors has been the evaluation of only one parameter at a time in most of the recent studies.In fact, only Scarpino et al. [12] accounted for the association of postacute clinical and instrumental parameters for the neurological outcome prediction, as suggested by Kotchoubey and Pavlov [13].In particular the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised total score at patient admission in IRU and its improvement in the first 4 weeks after admission, are the only clinical variables that have been showed to be predictors of neurological outcome predictors [9].Of the instrumental parameters, electroencephalography (EEG) has been the test most commonly investigated both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.",

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

      "title": "Invited Article: An MRI-based approach to the diagnosis of white matter disorders",
      "abstract": "There are many different white matter disorders, both inherited and acquired, and consequently the diagnostic process is difficult. Establishing a specific diagnosis is often delayed at great emotional and financial costs. The pattern of brain structures involved, as visualized by MRI, has proven to often have a high diagnostic specificity.We developed a comprehensive practical algorithm that relies mainly on the characteristics of brain MRI.The initial decision point defines a hypomyelination pattern, in which the cerebral white matter is hyperintense (normal), isointense, or slightly hypointense relative to the cortex on T1-weighted images, vs other pathologies with more prominent hypointensity of the cerebral white matter on T1-weighted images. In all types of pathology, the affected white matter is hyperintense on T2-weighted images, but, as a rule, the T2 hyperintensity is less marked in hypomyelination than in other pathologies. Some hypomyelinating disorders are typically associated with peripheral nerve involvement, while others are not. Lesions in patients with pathologies other than hypomyelination can be either confluent or isolated and multifocal. Among the diseases with confluent lesions, the distribution of the abnormalities is of high diagnostic value. Additional MRI features, such as white matter rarefaction, the presence of cysts, contrast enhancement, and the presence of calcifications, further narrow the diagnostic possibilities.Application of a systematic decision tree in MRI of white matter disorders facilitates the diagnosis of specific etiologic entities.",

Все още на психично болния се гледа като на неудачник, който не може да се справя с предизвикателствата на живота; който по наследство е обречен да е такъв. Често се загърбват социалните причини, които правят някои хора неуспяващи и поради това развиващи психично разстройство. Слабо информираните хора поставят под общ знаменател болните. Те не различават психично болен с психоза от този със слабоумение или тежка депресия, да не говорим за множеството болни с функционални, невротични разстройства. Всички психично болни предизвикват страх, затова биват отбягвани. По цял свят всеки би предпочел да е телесно болен, но никой - психично болен. Така набелязаният проблем съществува от векове. За нашата страна той е не по-различен отколкото за много други, дори високоразвити страни. У нас се знае твърде малко за начина на живот и за преживяванията на психично болния. Липсва достатъчно българска, широко популярна и все пак достатъчно научна литература за психичната болест, за нейните разновидности и начини за лечение. Всички тези причини, всяка поотделно и взети заедно, провокират появата на настоящото проучване.

      "abstract": "Sjogrens syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that mainly affects the exocrine glands and usually presents with sicca symptoms of the main mucosal surfaces. The prevalence and the type of central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage caused by SS are debatable. The wide spectrum of CNS manifestations, different classification criteria used and unclear inclusion or exclusion criteria pose some difficulty reviewing these studies. Careful examination of the SS patients and to be aware of neurological findings which may be associated with suspicious CNS involvement is highly important. Central nervous system may also hypothetically have a role in the pathophysiology of SS. The wide spectrum of CNS involvement includes focal (sensorial and motor deficits, brain stem, cerebellar lesions, seizure, migraine etc.) or non-focal (encephalomyelitis, aseptic meningitis, neuropsychiatric dysfunctions), spinal cord (myelopathy, transverse myelitis, motor neuron disease etc.) findings or multiple sclerosis-like illness and optic neuritis. Evolving imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance spectroscopy or magnetization transfer imaging are promising for better understanding the nature of CNS involvement in SS. Treatments usually comprise symptomatic approach in milder cases however, pulse cyclophosphamide and steroids or other immunosuppressants (chlorambucil or azathioprine) are required in cases with progressive symptoms leading to neurological impairment. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab and etanercept) and B cell targeted therapies (rituximab and epratuzumab) are used in primary SS however their efficacy on CNS manifestation is still unclear. Randomized, multicenter studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of treatment regimes which were reported to be effective in anecdotal reports or in small uncontrolled series. This article reviews the clinical approach to current therapy of CNS involvement in patients with primary SS. Keywords: Sjogren syndrome, central nervous system, immunosuppressant, treatment",

      "title": "Providing hearing rehabilitation to people with dementia presents unique challenges",
      "abstract": "Given the much anticipated increase in the number of older adults who will be coming to our clinics for assessment and treatment, it is imperative for the profession of audiology to address the unique needs of this population. One critical area of concern is the need for audiologists to be knowledgeable about age-related cognitive changes that may affect hearing assessment and rehabilitative approaches. This article focuses on older adults who have abnormal age-related changes in cognition and it provides clinical practice guidelines related to hearing rehabilitation for this unique and challenging patient population. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT Similar to hearing loss, cognitive impairment is characterized by various degrees of disorder, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. MCI is commonly defined as a subtle but measurable memory disorder characterized by memory impairment, normal general cognitive functioning, intact activities of daily living (ADL), and no dementia. A number of conditions may be associated with MCI, including early Alzheimer's disease, stroke, brain injury, brain tumors, central nervous system infections, major surgery such as open-heart surgery, and abusive use of alcohol or other drugs.1 A person with MCI experiences problems greater than normally expected with aging, but typically does not manifest symptoms associated with dementia, such as impaired judgment or reasoning. Diagnosis of MCI typically involves a family physician or geriatrician, who obtains the patient's medical history with a detailed description of the problems presented by the patient. A physical examination by the physician can also help determine the possible illnesses and other health conditions such as those mentioned above, particularly those that may be treatable. Computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood tests, and spinal taps may be conducted to identify possible causes of MCI. An important part of the MCI diagnostic procedure is neuropsychological testing, using evaluation tools to identify cognition and memory. Information about these tests may be available in health records or in the background provided in letters of referral. While there is a large body of information about Alzheimer's disease (AD), research on MCI is at a relatively early stage. MCI is defined by, and is widely viewed as, a transitional syndrome between normal cognitive function and dementia.2 It is estimated that approximately 3% to 19% of adults 65 years and older have some degree of MCI.3 Some people with MCI appear to remain stable or, in some cases, even return to normal after a period of time. However, more than half progress to dementia within 5 years.3 Dementia may range from mild to severe and, in contrast to MCI, is characterized by severe compromises in independent functioning. Patients with AD may be severely compromised by dementia-related cognitive deficits such as memory loss, as well as difficulty with multi-dimensional cognitive tasks necessary for independent living, including driving, preparing meals, and managing self-care such as personal finances, health care, and medications.4 Other warning signs described by the Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org) include word-finding difficulties, time and place disorientation, difficulty with abstract thinking, changes in mood, behavior, and personality, as well as decreased judgment and initiative. SCREENING FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT There are a number of options for screening for mild cognitive impairment and dementia. One of the most commonly administered clinical screening tests of cognitive function is the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).5 A total score of less than 23 on this 30-item test suggests impairment in cognitive function. The MMSE, which has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity, is normed according to education level and age. Although it is useful as a clinical screening tool to detect impairment, it is not sensitive to individual differences in cognitive performance that can affect communication in a healthy older population (see Pichora Fuller in this issue). Some cognitive screeners can be administered via telephone, such as the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified,7 although the examiner must know if the patient being screened has a hearing loss. However, there is some research to show that hearing impairment is not an obstacle to administering the TICs-m.8 Nevertheless, it is of critical importance for professionals to ensure that hearing impairment is not a confounding factor in cognitive test results. Weinstein and Amsel showed that hearing loss can present symptoms similar to those of dementia.9 When an older patient with a hearing loss responds inappropriately to an item on a cognitive measure, it may be due to hearing loss, cognitive compromises, or a combination of the two. Weinstein and Amsel compared the performance of institutionalized elders on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire,10 with and without use of an auditory trainer. Close to half of the patients with moderate hearing losses and all of the patients with severe losses showed clinically significant improvements in cognitive test results when test questions were presented with amplification. Thus, any older adult suspected of having a hearing loss should be tested in an amplified condition during cognitive measures. In my clinical experience, sound devices such as the Pocket-Talker® or Sound Wizard® can be quite useful in this regard. They are relatively easy for other health professionals to use when tests are being administered. CAPD may precede impairment Several research studies have shown that central auditory processing (CAP) disorders in older adults may be a precursor of cognitive impairment, including AD. For example, Gates and co-authors found that very poor performance on the Synthetic Sentence Identification with Ipsilateral Competing Message (SSI-ICM) test preceded the diagnosis of AD by several years, and thus might serve as an early screening test for cognitive disorders in older adults. The authors speculated that early identification of dementia via CAP tests such as the SSI-ICM might become even more relevant as new therapies for AD are found. In more recent research, Gates et al. found that CAP function was significantly poorer even with mild impairment, particularly for the Dichotic Sentence Identification test (free report mode).12 Thus, it is important to establish a routine of conducting CAP testing with older adults, not only to determine auditory rehabilitation needs, but also for early identification of possible cognitive loss. Finally, Vaughan and her co-authors conducted research to determine potential cognitive tests for use with older adults in audiology clinics.13 Various neuro-cognitive tests were compared to determine which would be most strongly associated with speech-recognition performance. Vaughn et al. chose the Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) subtest of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence©-III as the best cognitive measure for determining if an older adult has cognitive aging changes that might contribute to reduced speech understanding. The LNS requires the examinee to listen to a string of letters and numbers presented in random order and then to sort the numbers and letters in ascending and alphabetical order. The LNS is relatively easy and quick to administer (approximately 10 minutes) and may help the audiologist diagnose speech-perception difficulties and develop an appropriate treatment plan. TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT Neuropsychologists and other healthcare providers are exploring a number of intervention options for MCI and AD. According to the Alzheimer's Association web site (www.alz.org), the standard treatments for cognitive disorders address cognitive symptoms that affect memory, language, judgment, planning, attention, and other thought processes, as well as behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The predominant treatment for AD involves pharmaceutical attempts to delay the worsening of the symptoms associated with the disease. For persons with AD and MCI, computer-based cognitive training may improve everyday functioning, although much more research is needed in this area.14 Increasingly interventions are being used to assist older adults with MCI to maintain an active lifestyle. These include programs focused on cognitive engagement, social interaction, and physical exercise, with the expectation that these “use it or lose it” interventions may slow the rate of cognitive decline.15 Clearly, the patient's ability to hear and communicate is important to the success of such interventions. CONSIDERATIONS FOR H-I PATIENTS WITH MCI How prevalent is hearing loss in persons with dementia and mild cognitive impairments? Not surprisingly, given the effects of age on both cognitive status and hearing abilities, hearing loss is common among older adults with cognitive disorders. In fact, several studies have shown that the majority of individuals with cognitive disorders also have significant hearing losses.16,17 Using both pure-tone audiometry screening and hearing status questionnaires, Gold et al. found that 49 out of 52 patients with AD or other forms of cognitive impairment also had significant degrees of hearing loss.16 For research participants with suspected AD, the authors noted a significant discrepancy between the patient's self-report of hearing loss and that of their caregivers, whereas research participants with MCI were more reliable with their self-reports. Indeed, persons with cognitive impairment may be less able to understand their own health conditions. It is recommended that a hearing evaluation be part of any assessment of cognitive function—a suggestion audiologists should advocate to other health professionals. Some audiologists may question if the hearing of AD patients can be tested given their severely compromised mental abilities. However, Durrant and colleagues documented that patients with-moderate to severe AD can reliably participate in audiometric procedures, especially if they are encouraged throughout the testing.18 But the authors also found that even though patients with AD can be successfully tested, they rarely receive treatment for their hearing losses. Because cognitive impairment reduces patients' ability to remember what to do and their ability to initiate behaviors, it will be important during both testing and treatment to provide frequent prompts and reminders to sustain target behaviors. TREATMENT OPTIONS Palmer and her co-authors listed five major barriers to management of hearing loss in patients with AD: lack of medical referral, difficult-to-test stereotype, lack of efficacy data, inappropriate technology, and lack of access to ongoing care.19 These authors described a comprehensive hearing aid fitting program provided to an older adult with AD and his wife. Among the features of the fitting program were multiple visits to the patient's home pre- and post-fitting, use of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly20 to determine treatment effectiveness, selection of a hearing aid with adaptive compression, spousal instruction on care and use of the hearing aid, and daily tracking by the spouse of hearing aid use and its effects on the user. What were the results of this comprehensive approach to meeting the hearing needs of the older adult with AD? As reported by his wife, her husband could hear normal household sounds such as the furnace, the television no longer blared, she no longer had to raise her voice, and he derived greater enjoyment from going to church and was more interested in conversing with other people, all of which undoubtedly boosted quality of life for both the patient and his wife. In a subsequent study, Palmer et al. demonstrated how unconventional measurement of outcomes can assist in determining the success of hearing aid fitting.21 The researchers obtained valid audiometric data (otoscopy, pure-tone air- and bone-conduction thresholds, and immittance screening) for the eight research participants, who all lived at home and had been diagnosed with AD. They then provided amplification to these eight individuals, and assessed the outcomes. To determine treatment efficacy, they asked the patients' caregivers (either a spouse or a child) to list problem behaviors (e.g., repetitive questioning, arguments, and disturbance of activities) that they perceived as being related to the patients' hearing difficulties. According to their caregivers, the patients wore their hearing aids from 5 to 15 hours a day, and one to four problem behaviors were significantly reduced for each of the patients. Seven of the eight caregivers showed clinically significant improvements in their perception of their spouse's or parent's hearing handicap. Caregivers' comments also provided compelling evidence as to the success of the hearing aid fittings. For example, many reported that patients requested that their hearing aids be placed in their ears and that the patients were easier to engage in conversation, generally more alert, and more aware of background noises such as doorbells, microwave oven signals, etc. Being able to hear these everyday sounds may help individuals with AD feel less isolated and more in touch with their environment. The two patients with the more severe cases of AD showed the least benefit from hearing aid use. Overall the authors' findings are encouraging, and provide some degree of assurance that patients with AD can use hearing aids successfully and will likely benefit from them. FINAL NOTE Both cognitive impairment and significant sensorineural hearing loss are found primarily among older adults. Therefore, it is critical that audiologists make other healthcare providers aware of the negative effects of untreated hearing loss on older adults. Lack of awareness that many symptoms of hearing loss are identical or similar to some symptoms of cognitive disorders may lead providers to erroneously identify cognitive issues in older patients whose actual problem is hearing impairment. Or they may be misled into thinking that patients have more severe cognitive impairments than they really do. Worse still, failing to address hearing loss could accelerate the symptoms of cognitive decline. The profession of audiology, perhaps in conjunction with the Hearing Loss Association of America, should increase its efforts to promulgate the need to determine if hearing loss is a factor when older adults exhibit troubling behaviors such as confusion, inappropriate responses, and withdrawal from friends and family. These types of behavior are common in older adults with hearing loss and may lead families and healthcare practitioners to mistakenly assume that cognitive impairment is responsible for all of these problem behaviors.",

      "title": "Il contributo dell'intelligenza artificiale nella diagnosi dei disturbi neurodegenerativi",
      "abstract": "Le patologie neurodegenerative associate ai disturbi neuro- cognitivi (DNC) rappresentano una emergenza assistenziale dalle dimensioni epidemiologiche sempre più rilevanti. Tale emergenza è destinata ad aumen- tare in relazione a un progressivo aumento della prospettiva di vita, essendo i DNC correlati con l'età. Se è vero che i DNC si manifestano con una franca alterazione delle funzioni cognitive con impatto funzionale nella vita della persona colpita, è altrettanto vero che il processo patologico inizia, molte volte, prima della comparsa della sindrome clinica. In questo intervallo di tempo, anche a distanza di anni dall'esordio del DNC, possono presentarsi quadri clinici più o meno sfumati di disturbo cognitivo accomunati dall'e- tichetta di \"disturbo cognitivo lieve\" o Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) e di Disturbo Cognitivo Soggettivo o Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). Una generale sensibilità a queste forme prodromiche è necessaria per: 1) l'impostazione di un quadro di intervento farmacologico, neuropsicologico ed assistenziale tempestivo ed efficace; 2) l'inserimento della persona in trial clinici per la sperimentazione di farmaci per la stabilizzazione della patolo- gia degenerativa. Ad oggi la distinzione tra invecchiamento normale, forme lievi o soggettive e la loro evoluzione in quadri di DNC maggiori avviene attraverso una attenta anamnesi cognitivo-comportamentale ed una accura- ta valutazione clinica compreso un uso attento e competente degli strumenti cognitivi di screening. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, un apporto importante è anche stato offerto dalle tecnologie e nello specifico dall'Intelligenza Artificiale (IA), dal Machi- ne Learning (ML) e dal Deep Learning (DL). Questi strumenti si sono dimo- strati accurati e affidabili: 1) nella rilevazione precoce di un DNC; 2) nella prognosi di una potenziale evoluzione di un DNC lieve in maggiore; 3) nella diagnosi differenziale dei DNC. Il presente lavoro ha l'obiettivo di mostrare in che modo l'applicazione dell'IA, del ML e del DL possa contribuire a una più efficace e tempestiva diagnosi dei disturbi neurodegenerativi.",

Although cognitive function can be assessed using neuropsychological tests, diagnosing postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) reliably appears to be difficult. Therefore, the true incidence of POCD is unknown. Severe POCD, which is apparent even without neuropsychological testing, is predominantly reported after cardiac and hip-replacement surgery. In these cases, POCD probably reflects micro embolic brain injury. Apart from the nature of the surgical procedure, advanced age is the most important risk factor for POCD.

      "abstract": "Depressive phenomenology, in its diverse nosological forms, affects 8-10% of children and adolescents of general population. Most frequently mood disorders have a primary origin, following poligenic multifactorial model. Moreover there is a non negligible proportion of cases in which depressive symptoms accompany neurological illnesses or they even constitute a part of predominant manifestations at the clinical start of neurologic disease, or mark a point of inflexion in its course. The aim of the present article is to review relevant literature dealing with this topic.A significative higher frequency of depressive phenomenology, not explainable by hazard, can be an early manifestation in children and adolescents with: epileptic syndromes, sleep disorders, chronic recurrent cephalalgias, several neurometabolic diseases, and intracranial tumors. Points of coincidence have been shown in dysequilibrium of brain neurotransmitters (serotonine, noradrenaline, hyperglutamatergic states) which could not be hypothesized as maintaining both neurological and mood conditions.The suspiction of a neurological disease should be adopted in cases of mood disorder not easily explainable by familial antecedents or clear biographical stressors. The search for a brain disorder by means of a meticulous anamnesis and neurological clinical and ancillary exams makes possible to discover the brain disorder at a very early stage and ameliorate the chances of accurately manage both the neurological and mood disorders. The simultaneous treatment of both dimension of the illness helps to improve the patients' quality of life.Fenomenologia depresiva al inicio de enfermedades neuropediatricas.Introduccion. La depresion, en sus diversas formas, afecta al 8-10% de niños y adolescentes y en la mayor parte de casos su origen es primario, siguiendo el modelo genetico multifactorial. Pero hay una proporcion de pacientes, no bien cuantificada todavia, en la que la depresion acompaña precozmente una enfermedad neurologica o marca un punto de inflexion en el curso de esta. El objetivo es revisar la bibliografia al respecto. Desarrollo. Se observa fenomenologia depresiva, con una frecuencia significativamente mayor que por azar, en niños y adolescentes afectos de epilepsia, trastornos del sueño, cefaleas primarias cronicas recurrentes, enfermedades neurometabolicas y tumores intracraneales. En varias de estas patologias neuropediatricas se hipotetizan puntos de coincidencia fisiopatologica con la depresion a traves de un deficit de disponibilidad cerebral de serotonina y noradrenalina. No se considera aqui la depresion disadaptativa a una neurodiscapacidad cronica. Conclusiones. En niños y adolescentes, los trastornos del animo sintomaticos de enfermedad neurologica deben sospecharse en ausencia de antecedentes familiares o de experiencias vitales que los expliquen. La busqueda sistematica de anomalias neurologicas y los examenes complementarios permitirian en estos casos abordar precozmente el tratamiento de la enfermedad cerebral causante del cuadro depresivo. A su vez, como ocurre en casos de epilepsia, cefaleas o trastorno del sueño, la terapia farmacologica y psicologica del cuadro depresivo contribuye a mejorar la calidad de vida de los afectados.",

La encefalomielitis diseminada aguda es un trastorno inflamatorio desmielinizante y multifocal que afecta al sistema nervioso central, de inicio agudo y curso clinico monofasico. El proceso inflamatorio se encuentra mediado por mecanismos inmunologicos y su relacion con infecciones por el virus dengue aun no se establece con claridad. Objetivo: Describir un caso clinico con manifestaciones del sistema nervioso central despues de una probable infeccion por el virus dengue. Presentacion del caso: Paciente femenina de 50 anos, con antecedentes de hipertension arterial controlada. Quince dias despues de un cuadro de fiebre de 4 dias de duracion, que posiblemente fue por una infeccion por el virus dengue, comienza con sintomas y signos de afectacion neurologica caracterizadas por ligera irritabilidad, dificultad para la concentracion en una actividad especifica de la vida cotidiana. Progresivamente se nota dificultad motora en el hemicuerpo izquierdo ademas de encontrarse agitada y distraida, motivo por el cual se decide su ingreso hospitalario. Se realiza el diagnostico a traves de los hallazgos en el examen fisico, los estudios positivos de resonancia magnetica nuclear y el resultado positivo de la IgM de dengue en sangre. Tanto la evolucion clinica como la respuesta al tratamiento con esteroides fueron favorables.

They consulted for progressively worsening troubles of step which were related to a combined degeneration of the cord. This degeneration was associated to a cerebellar syndrome in one case. An isolated macrocytosis with a mean MGV at 109 fl, was noticed allowing thus to evoke the Biermer pernicious disease. This diagnosis was confirmed by the marrow puncture which showed a medullar megaloblastosis in two cases and an erythroblastic nucleocytoplasmic maturation's asynchronism. Treated by vitamin B12, the evolution was favorable in two cases with a total neurological recovery after six months in two patients. One patient died after six days of treatment following an acute myocardial infarction.

      "title": "Een multidisciplinaire beschouwing over logopedische zorg bij patiënten met cognitieve communicatiestoornissen",
      "abstract": "Inleiding Niet-aangeboren hersenletsel (NAH) kan verstrekkende gevolgen hebben, waaronder problemen in de communicatie. Cognitieve communicatiestoornissen (CCS) zijn communicatiestoornissen, die geen afasie zijn. CCS worden meestal tijdens maar voornamelijk na de revalidatie na NAH herkend. Revalideren kan in een revalidatiecentrum of in een verpleeghuis met Geriatrische Revalidatiezorg (GRZ). Een multidisciplinair team in GRZ bestaat onder andere uit een specialist ouderengeneeskunde, neuropsycholoog, fysiotherapeut, ergotherapeut, verzorgende en een logopedist. De rol van de logopedist bij patienten met CCS is in Nederland weinig beschreven. Naast beperkte beschrijvingen in richtlijnen, is er ook weinig bekend over de verwachtingen van andere disciplines betreffende de rol van de logopedist. Met dit onderzoek zijn daarom de perspectieven van de specialist ouderengeneeskunde, neuropsycholoog, fysiotherapeut, ergotherapeut, verzorgende en de logopedist betreffende de logopedische zorg voor patienten met CCS in verpleeghuis X geinventariseerd. \r\nMethode Via kwalitatief onderzoek door afname van interviews zijn de perspectieven, meningen en verwachtingen van de zes genoemde disciplines als casestudie vergaard. Topics van de interviews zijn gegenereerd uit de bestudeerde literatuur, waarna vragen en steekwoorden zijn geformuleerd. Na open transcriberen, zijn er open en axiaal codes toegewezen, welke gegroepeerd zijn en in een woordweb inzichtelijk zijn gemaakt. Met pilot interviews is beoogd de validiteit en betrouwbaarheid van het onderzoek te vergroten. \r\nResultaten Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de logopedist in verpleeghuis X nog weinig screent bij patienten met CCS. Er blijkt onder de respondenten onduidelijkheid over de definiering van CCS en van de symptomen van CCS te bestaan. De logopedist werd als behandelaar van CCS genoemd en voorlichting en adviezen aan omgeving en patient werden als behandelaspecten genoemd. Adviezen aan andere disciplines zijn gewenst en worden verwacht in verslaggeving van de logopedist. In verslaggeving vanuit andere disciplines naar de logopedist worden de opvallendheden van de communicatie van de patient verwacht.\r\nDiscussie Uit de resultaten van de interviews kan worden geconcludeerd dat de perspectieven van de verschillende disciplines in het multidisciplinair team op de rol van de logopedist bij CCS niet eenduidig zijn en verschillen per discipline. Er blijkt verschil te zijn in definiering en er worden verschillende onderdelen genoemd voor screening, onderzoek, behandeling en verslaggeving. Door de logopedist is de wens geuit voor meer eenduidige onderbouwde kennis over CCS en een genormeerd onderzoeksinstrument voor diagnostiek bij CCS. Een richtlijn zou hierbij uitkomst kunnen bieden. \r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nA multidisciplinary view on logopedic care for patients with cognitive-communication disorders by Anne-Marij van Woudenbergh.\r\nIntroduction Acquired brain injury (ABI) has far-reaching effects, one of which is communication problems. Cognitive communication disorders (CCD) are communication disorders that differ from aphasia. CCD is often diagnosed during, but mostly after rehabilitation. Rehabilitation can be done in a rehabilitation centre, or geriatric rehabilitation in a nursing home. A multidisciplinary team in geriatric rehabilitation can comprise of a geriatric care specialist, neuropsychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, nurse, and a speech-language therapist. The responsibilities a speech-language therapist has with regards to CCD patients is not specified very clearly in the Netherlands. There are limited guidelines, and little knowledge on expectations of other disciplines concerning a speech-language therapist’s responsibilities. That's why this study focuses on the perspectives of the geriatric care specialist, neuropsychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, nurse, and speech-language therapist regarding speech-language pathology related care for patients with CCD in nursing home X.\r\nMethod A qualitative research as a case study has been done by taking interviews which surveyed the perspectives, opinions and expectations of the six previously mentioned disciplines. The topics for the interviews were created by looking at the current literature. These were then used to formulate questions and keywords. Open and axial codes were applied and grouped in a word web after open transcribing. Pilot interviews have been used to increase the validity and reliability of this research.\r\nResults This research shows that the speech-language therapist in nursing home X could screen and test more. The definitions and nomenclature of CCD are unclear, especially regarding the symptoms of CCD. The speech-language therapist is referred to as the principal carer for patients with CCD. Education and council towards the patient and the people close to them are mentioned as care aspects. Advice to other disciplines is desired and expected in the speech therapists reporting. Reports from other disciplines intended for the speech-language therapist should contain the noteworthy aspects of a patient's communication.\r\nDiscussion The data gathered using the interviews can be used to conclude that the perspectives of the various disciplines in a multidisciplinary team on the role of a speech-language therapist in treatment of CCD are not clear-cut and can differ from discipline to discipline. Definitions are ambiguous and various screening, research, treatment and reporting tools are mentioned. The speech-language therapist has voiced the desire for clearer and more substantiated knowledge on CCD and a standardized research instrument for diagnosing CCD. A guideline could be helpful in this regard.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare neurological sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness despite normal sleep duration, that can significantly impact patient's lives. The burden of IH goes beyond excessive daytime sleepiness, pervading all aspects of everyday life. Characteristic and burdensome symptoms of IH include sleep inertia/drunkenness, long sleep duration, and daytime cognitive dysfunction. This systematic review assessed current knowledge regarding IH diagnostic challenges and burden of illness. Literature searches for original epidemiological, clinical, humanistic, or economic research relevant to IH published between 2012 and 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, gray literature (diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines), conferences (2019-2022), and clinical trial databases yielded 97 articles. Findings indicate that IH remains a poorly defined diagnosis of exclusion that is difficult to distinguish from narcolepsy type 2 because of symptom overlap and inadequacies of objective testing. Consequently, individuals with IH endure diagnostic delays of up to 9 years. The economic burden of IH has not been characterized to any appreciable extent. Pharmacological treatment options can improve symptoms and functional status, but rarely restores normal levels of functioning. These findings highlight the need to reclassify central disorders of hypersomnolence. Further collaboration is now required between research groups to identify and validate objective markers to help redefine diagnostic criteria for IH. This would move IH into a position that could benefit from future targeted therapeutic interventions. The study was funded by Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.",

The exact pathophysiology of AFCE is unknown, but many pathomechanisms have been proposed. We present a case of an 18-year-old female in excellent physical condition who presented with respiratory insufficiency after being recently diagnosed with influenza B infection. Three days later, she developed acute encephalopathy, leading to brain death.

      "abstract": "The media and public health generally focus on the biological and physical ramifications of epidemics. Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially with a focus on Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or fiscal estimates solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations. Therefore, those on the frontlines of epidemics including emergency physicians, primary care providers and infectious disease specialists should serve communicate this need and advocate for sustained and increased funding for mental health programs to heighten public awareness regarding acute psychiatric events during infectious diseases outbreaks and offer treatment and support when necessary.",

      "title": "Neuroimmune-mediated neuropsychiatric syndromes: perspectives for standardised diagnostics and personalised care",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is considerable interest in the role of neuroimmune processes in neuropsychiatric presentations among young people seeking mental health, neurological, paediatric and rheumatological services. The increasing availability of new immunotherapies, particularly monoclonal antibodies, introduces challenges in effectively and appropriately selecting candidates for immunotherapies. Neuroimmune-mediated neuropsychiatric syndromes (NIMNPS) typically include two broad types: i) ‘autoimmune encephalitis’, characterised by acute or subacute onset, neurological signs such as seizures, delirium or motor features and severe psychotic or major mood phenomena. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis was a pioneering clinical example, but various other autoantibodies have since been associated with this phenotype; and ii) atypical mood or psychotic syndromes with sub-acute or insidious onset, moderately severe atypical mood or psychotic symptoms, autonomic dysregulation, narcolepsy-like features, poor response to conventional treatments and adverse (notably motor) effects from psychotropic medications. Diagnosis of NIMNPS requires clinical or laboratory evidence of direct brain involvement, though autoantibodies are not always detectable. Given the broad and controversial diagnostic criteria for NIMNPS, we propose standardised clinical criteria for identifying ‘possible cases’, followed by laboratory, neuropsychological and brain imaging tests to confirm ‘probable’ cases suitable for immunotherapy. We emphasise rapid clinical and informed co-decision-making with young people and their families and loved ones. While immunotherapy holds promise for symptom alleviation, highly-personalised approaches and long-term management are essential. Future research should validate our proposed criteria, establish optimal, standardised yet personalised immunotherapy strategies that balance between clinical benefit and risks, and identify predictive markers of treatment response.",

Both patients had significant neurologic deficits and no well-known risk factors or presence of comorbidities (such as diabetes or a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease). Early diagnosis is important in cases of AAC owing to its high mortality rate; however, due to neurological deficits in our cases, accurate medical and physical examinations were limited, thereby leading to a delay in the diagnosis. The first case was of a 33-year-old woman with multiple fractures and hypovolemic shock due to a traumatic accident; she was diagnosed with hypoxic brain injury. The second case was of a 32-year-old woman with bipolar disorder and early-onset cerebellar ataxia who developed symptoms of impaired cognition and psychosis; she was later diagnosed with autoimmune encephalopathy. In the first case, the duration between symptom onset and diagnosis was 1 day, but in the second case, it was 4 days from diagnosis based on the occurrence of high fever. We emphasize that if a young woman presents with high fever, the possibility of AAC should be considered, particularly if a CNS lesion is present because it may pose difficulty in the evaluation of typical symptoms of AAC. Careful attention is thus required in such cases.",

Attacks of acute type neuro-Behcets syndrome are sometimes self-limiting. However, when the neurological manifestations are progressive and severe, administration of corticosteroid is necessary. In addition, infliximab and interferon alpha might also be effective in acute type neuro-Behcets disease. There are no drugs which have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing the occurrence of attacks of acute type neuro-Behcets disease. Colchicine, low dose of steroids and various immunosuppressive drugs have been used anecdotally for this purpose. As to chronic progressive neuro-Behcets syndrome, one should realize that corticosteroids are not effective. Cyclophosphamide is not effective, either. Low dose methotrexate (MTX) has been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of chronic progressive neuro- Behcets syndrome by an open clinical trial. Thus, low dose MTX has been shown to decrease cerebrospinal fluid IL-6 levels without progression of neuropsychological manifestations, although there are a fraction of patients who do not adequately respond to MTX. Preliminary results indicate that infliximab has a beneficial effect in such patients with MTXresistant chronic progressive neuro-Behcets syndrome.

In IHHS , children develop hemispheric brain atrophy with contralateral hemiplegia, epilepsy, and a variable degree of cognitive deficit. Patients with FIRES develop refractory epilepsy with severe cognitive deficit affecting the temporal and frontal lobe functions. The role of inflammation is hypothesized with a vicious circle involving inflammation and seizure activity facilitated by brain maturation putting them under the concept of “acute encephalopathy with inflammation‐mediated status epilepticus.”",

      "title": "ANTI-CASPR2 ASSOCIATED ENCEPHALITIS, A CASE REPORT (P1.161)",
      "abstract": "Objective: NA Background: Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain with different etiologies. There are several types of encephalitis that are immune-mediated, including paraneoplastic and encephalitis syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal cell surface/synaptic proteins, referred to as autoimmune encephalitis. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis include a subacute onset of working memory deficits, altered mental status or psychiatric symptoms; at least one of the following: focal CNS findings, not explained seizures, CSF pleocytosis, MRI suggestive of encephalitis, and exclusion of alternative causes. Design/Methods: We reported the case of a 68 year-old man presenting with a two-month history of generalized seizures and progressive mood and cognitive dysfunction. The EEG did not have epileptic activity; basic cerebrospinal fluid parameters were normal, and brain MRI did not showed any abnormalities. With a provisional diagnosis, We started treatment with glucocoticoids, endovenous immune globuline and antiseizures drugs, while we waited for the antibodies results. Results: Serum and CSF antibodies testing were positive for Caspr-2. Initially the patient had a good response to the immunotherapy, nevertheless he had a relapse two weeks later with a new episode of seizures and mood disturbance. A second course with the same outline treatment was needed, with a complete response. This disorder involve a contactin-associated protein-like 2. It can manifest as limbic encephalitis or Morvan syndrome ( neuromyotonia, memory loss, sleep disturbances, autonomic instability ) This disorder affects older men, and it is associated with cancer (usually thymoma) in about 20 percent of cases. Most patients have responses to immunotherapy, with a relapsing rate about 25 percent. Conclusions: In our case we did not find an associated tumor until this moment. These disorders are highly responsive to immunomodulatory therapies. As early initiation of treatment has been shown to improve outcomes, speed recovery, and reduce the risk of relapses, it is important that these syndromes are promptly recognized.

      "abstract": "Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI), vision loss due to brain injury in early childhood, is the leading cause --- approximately 40% --- of bilateral visual impairment in children from industrialized countries and is the most rapidly growing cause among children in developing countries. Typical causes of CVI include abnormal brain development or brain damage, often consequential to birth-related complications such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, meningitis, hydrocephalus, and head injury. The current gold standard for clinical diagnosis require a trained clinician to administer visual-motor integration tests in conjunction with a thorough review of a patient's clinical history. This approach does not scale to meet the needs of undiagnosed children with CVI. Recently, non-invasive screening methods such as administering a higher visual function question inventory (HVFQI), have been shown to accurately capture the observations of teachers and guardians of children. Analysis of those observations has been shown to have very high correlation with visual-motor integration tests (p values < 0.01). In this poster, we present a clinical database and information system, the HVFQI web app, which delivers a scalable, non-invasive pediatric CVI screening that is currently administered by a clinician, but has the potential to be self-administered in the near future, with follow-up clinical consultation for participants that screen positive or near-positive.",

      "abstract": "We describe 7 children with myoclonic encephalopathy of infants (MEI). MEI is a clinical entity characterized by an acute or subacute onset of polymyoclonia, cerebellar ataxia and opsoclonus (\"dancing eyes\"). It occurs either spontaneously, following an infectiuos illness or in association with an occult neuroblastoma. It is likely that immunological factors play a role in the pathogenesis. Steroid therapy resulted in rapid dramatic improvement of the neurological symptoms in 4 cases. However, this initial response did not correlate with the eventual outcome. We reviewed the literature to compare 45 reported cases of MEI associated with a neuroblastoma with 48 children without such a tumor to identify possible differences in clinical presentation, response to steroid medication and long-term prognosis of the neurological syndrome. In this respect we found no differences. Impairment of motor, verbal or intellectual performance were reported in at least half the cases. Although an immediate and marked response to steroids occurs in many cases of both groups, it remains unclear whether the long-term outcome is favourably influenced by this medication. The two-year-survival rate (90%) in the neuroblastoma group and the percentage of mediastinal localisation of the tumor (49%) are much higher compared with neuroblastomas without MEI. The reasons for these remarkable differences are not known. Diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications justify the separation of MEI from the more common and benign syndrome known as acute cerebellar ataxia of childhood.",

      "abstract": "The population frequency of neuropsychic developmental delays in infants is estimated at nearly 10%; that of global intellectual disability (mental retardation) is at 1-3%. Delayed development is denned as a substantial retardation as compared to the standard indicators in any of the basic spheres: motor, communicative, cognitive, adaptive-behavioral, and socioemotional ones. Global developmental delay is characterized by a significant lag in two or more spheres. The use of current diagnostic techniques, such as the Bayley or Griffiths scales, can provide an objective quantitative assessment of both an infant's overall development and indicators in individual spheres. At the preliminary examination stage, it is expedient to carry out a Denver developmental screening test that may be directly used in a doctor's consulting room. The causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability in infants may be perinatal central nervous system (CNS) lesions; brain malformations; intrauterine infections; intrauterine intoxications; early-onset psychoneurological diseases (neuroinfections, CNS injuries, epilepsies, autism spectrum disorders, etc.); congenital hypothyroidism; genetic diseases. Among all genetic causes of global developmental delay/intellectual disability, there are chromosomal anomalies (25-30%), monogenic diseases (metabolic diseases, neuroectodermal syndromes, diseases with predominant grey and white matter involvement). The diagnostic possibilities of current genetic methods are considered.",

These symptoms have been ascribed to a toxic or a general inflammatory reaction of the cerebral cortex or to a vascular lesion consequent to changes in the blood vessels. The condition has come to be known as acute nonsuppurative encephalitis. The term, unfortunately, does not indicate a specific clinical entity and is not associated with a clearcut pathologic picture. It has been applied to any presumed cerebral lesion in patients presenting the history of acute onset of an infectious state which, early in its course, was accompanied by cerebral symptoms. The most common manifestations in such instances are generalized or localized convulsions, which may or may not be followed by hemiplegia. In some instances, the predisposing infection is known, such as one of",

Patients with advanced HIV disease are more likely to suffer exaggerated adverse reactions to psychotropic medication. People with epilepsy have elevated prevalence of several psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and psychosis. The commonest autosomal deletion is a multisystem disorder with a heterogeneous presentation which varies greatly in severity between affected individuals. Mental illness may present in unusual ways in learning disabilities, for example, depression as selfinjurious behaviour, persecutory ideation as complaints of being ‘picked on’. In people with multiple sclerosis (MS), depression is common with a point prevalence of 14‐31% and lifetime prevalence of up to 50%. There are no published trials for the drug treatment of anxiety in MS, but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used and in non‐responsive cases, venlafaxine might be an option.",

Other less common causes include prolonged gastroenterology problems or dietary insufficiencies associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, bariatric surgery, and eating disorders. Prolonged WE without proper treatment can lead to the chronic and irreversible condition, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Despite being known for its classic triad of clinical symptoms (nystagmus/ophthalmoplegia, gait ataxia, and confusion), WE patients more commonly present with non-specific symptoms of altered mental status. Obscure clinical presentations often led to delays in the appropriate of patients with WE. We are presenting a case of WE that is unusual because the underlying cause is schizophrenia and the lack of alcohol use. For a punctual diagnosis, a high index of suspicion is essential to prevent further exacerbation of neuronal death seen in WE. IV thiamine should be administered to any patient with acute encephalopathy or altered mental status, given its low cost and lack of side effects.",

Quite often one might see a vertical down beat nystagmus in the head hanging position of Stenger's maneuver. iii) Saccadic or ataxic ocular pursuit in the eye tracking test, iv) Abnormal findings of the optokinetic after nystagums test, which could suggest some disorder in the central nervous system, usually decreased optokinetic after nystagmus v) Abnormal x-ray findings in the cervical spine, e.g. cervical spondylosis.Diseases which could cause vertigo or dizziness other then V.B.I. should be ruled out.A partient with abnormalities of all five items has definite V.B.I., one with four or three abnormal items has probable V.B.I., and one with two items has possible V.B.I., To establish these criteria of V.B.I., we analyzed 250 partients with vertigo experienced during the past three years. Peripheral vertigo was pressent in 39% and central vertigo in 23%.

      "abstract": "Sepsis associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common but poorly understood neurological complication of sepsis. It is characterized by diffuse brain dysfunction secondary to infection elsewhere in the body without overt CNS infection. The pathophysiology of SAE is complex and multifactorial including a number of intertwined mechanisms such as vascular damage, endothelial activation, breakdown of the blood brain barrier, altered brain signaling, brain inflammation, and apoptosis. Clinical presentation of SAE may range from mild symptoms such as malaise and concentration deficits to deep coma. The evaluation of cognitive dysfunction is made difficult by the absence of any specific investigations or biomarkers and the common use of sedation in critically ill patients. SAE thus remains diagnosis of exclusion which can only be made after ruling out other causes of altered mentation in a febrile, critically ill patient by appropriate investigations. In spite of high mortality rate, management of SAE is limited to treatment of the underlying infection and symptomatic treatment for delirium and seizures. It is important to be aware of this condition because SAE may present in early stages of sepsis, even before the diagnostic criteria for sepsis can be met. This review discusses the diagnostic approach to patients with SAE along with its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and differential diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Persistence of symptoms beyond initial three to four weeks after infection is defined as Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS).A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and cognitive disturbances have been observed in PACS.The review was conducted based on PRISMA-S guidelines for literature search strategy for systematic reviews.Cytokine storm in COVID-19 may cause a breach in the blood brain barrier leading to cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain.This triggers immune response in brain by activating microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells leading to neuroinflammation.Various inflammatory biomarkers like inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and plays a major role in the precipitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms.Impaired adult neurogenesis has been linked with a variety of disorders like depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia.Persistence of neuroinflammation is observed in COVID-19 survivors three months after recovery.Chronic neuroinflammation alters adult neurogenesis with pro-inflammatory cytokines supressing and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines favouring adult neurogenesis.Based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS, there is more possibility for a potential impairment in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19",

      "abstract": "Abstract Drug‐resistant epilepsy, not associated with acute brain complications or central nervous system leukaemic involvement, can develop in patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukaemia during childhood. It has been postulated that this rare complication may be due to CNS oncological treatment neurotoxicity, related to intrathecal drugs, such as methotrexate, and brain radiotherapy. We report four patients who developed drug‐resistant epilepsy sometime after receiving treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia. All patients were female and received intrathecal methotrexate. One received additional intrathecal cytarabine, and two concomitant brain radiotherapy. Two developed Lennox‐Gastaut type syndrome, one multifocal epilepsy, and one focal epilepsy related to a radiotherapy‐induced cavernous angioma. The development of drug‐resistant epilepsy after treatment for acute lymphocytic leukaemia is a rare complication that may vary, from focal epilepsy to an epileptic encephalopathy. This may appear even years after the treatment has finished and is most likely associated with treatment‐related neurotoxicity.",

Capgras syndrome is the most common subtype of this disorder, being defined by the recurrent and transient belief that someone close has been substituted by an imposter. These entities are generally associated with neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disturbances. Rare reports of associations between misidentification syndromes and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis have been published, but no papers address a correlation with limbic encephalitis or lymphoma.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

It usually occurs in the setting of advanced liver cirrhosis or acute fulminant hepatic failure. An extensive Medline search was undertaken and all relevant papers found were critically examined. Special emphasis was paid to clinical trials and meta-analyses. All guidelines and conference proceedings related to hepatic encephalopathy were also examined. HE presents with a spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations that may be quite subtle (minimal HE) or overt, ranging from disturbance of the sleep pattern to deep hepatic coma. Most patients with HE may be diagnosed on clinical grounds only after excluding other causes of neurological disease, but a wide variety of neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological tests may be utilized. The first step in the management of patients with HE should be supportive care. Following that, a significant effort must be exerted to find and correct possible exacerbating factors which may include: renal impairment, infection, constipation, drugs, gastrointestinal bleeding and other factors. Medications used to treat patients with encephalopathy aim to reduce toxin production, increase toxin elimination, and protect the brain from the harmful effects of these toxins. A critical analysis of the evidence concerning most of the available management modalities is presented. Ultimately, all patients with HE must be considered for liver transplantation. It is concluded that early recognition, positive diagnosis, and a multi-target management plan constitutes appropriate management of patients with HE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter includes the results of central motor conduction studies in conditions which do not fit happily into the classifications of earlier chapters. The effects of a large number of drugs on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) have been documented and these are included here but a discussion of anaesthetic and paralysing agents is included in Chapter 18.In this rare syndrome, attacks of transient unilateral weakness occur beginning in the first year oflife. Attacks may occur on either side at different times, may last minutes to hours and may occur up to several times per week. A slowly progressive neurological deficit may develop comprising intellectual impairment, dysarthria and dystonia. The cause of the condition is unknown, but the similarity with familial hemiplegic migraine is striking. Another possibility is mitochondrial cytopathy. The origin of the progressive deteriora tion has been suggested to be due to accumulated microvascular lesions, but there is no evidence for this on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance spectro scopy. A 23-year-old patient with this condition has been investigated between attacks and during an attack ofleft hemiplegia (Nezu et al. 1997b). Interestingly, the patient had also developed episodic ataxia (see Chapter 13) which occurred independently of the hemiplegia. Between attacks, central motor conduction time (CMCT) to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was normal (right, 7.8 m; left, 7.3 ms). During the attack, CMCT to the left FDI was prolonged at 10.9 ms. Corticomotor threshold and peripheral nerve conduction were unchanged during the attack. Because of the transient nature of attacks, slowing of central conduction cannot be due to demyelination. The normal corticomotor threshold argues against a large shift in cortical or spinal excitability. The most likely explanation is an alteration in temporal summation at the spinal motoneuron.",

      "abstract": "Varicella–Zoster virus (VZV) is a pathogenic human alpha herpes virus that causes varicella (chicken pox) as a primary infection and, following a variable period of latency in different ganglionic neurons, it reactivates to produce herpes zoster (shingles). The focus of this review is on the wide spectrum of the possible neurological manifestations of VZV reactivation. While the most frequent reactivation syndrome is herpes zoster, this may be followed by the serious and painful post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and by many other neurological conditions. Prominent among these conditions is a VZV vasculopathy, but the role of VZV in causing giant cell arteritis (GCA) is currently controversial. VZV reactivation can also cause segmental motor weakness, myelitis, cranial nerve syndromes, Guillain–Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and zoster sine herpete, where a neurological syndrome occurs in the absence of the zoster rash. The field is complicated by the relatively few cases of neurological complications described and by the issue of causation when a neurological condition is not manifest at the same time as the zoster rash.",

There were no focal deficits on examination. CSF protein elevation (1.72 g/L) without pleocytosis, brain MRI (figure), and significant improvement following methylprednisolone were consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Pathologic yawning is described in other demyelinating diseases, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and multiple sclerosis, but is rarely reported with ADEM. Although prior reports postulated that brainstem and hypothalamic lesions are responsible,1 yawning is a complex reflex mediated by both supratentorial and infratentorial structures; its precise localization is not yet defined.2",

According to published literature, neurological manifestations can be observed in 10-15% of cases. Here is a case of a 65-year-old female patient who presented with a history of fever lasting six days, followed by seizures and loss of consciousness. Leptospira IgM was found to be positive, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple acute cerebral infarcts. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics, antiepileptics and other symptomatic treatments. During her hospital stay, the patient improved symptomatically. Neurological manifestations of leptospirosis may result from immune-mediated reactions, leading to cerebral arteritis.

This chapter discusses the following conditions under myogenic palsies: myasthenia gravis; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS); chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO); orbital myositis; and rhabdomyosarcoma. The ocular symptoms and signs, for myasthenia, are the same whether the disease is confined to the eye muscles or if the eye involvement is one aspect of systemic disease. In patients with life-threatening breathing or swallowing difficulty, plasmaphoresis along with human immunoglobulin can reduce the level of circulating antibodies. LEMS is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission that differs from myasthenia in that the transmission defect is presynaptic rather than postsynaptic. CPEO may occur alone or in association with a variety of systemic disorders.",

HE manifests with a wide range of symptoms that include behavioral changes and confusion. Elevated thyroid antibodies are present in the majority of cases and are required for the diagnosis of HE. Normal brain MRI findings are found in the majority of patients diagnosed with HE. The most consistent CSF abnormality noted in HE patients is the presence of elevated protein. Most HE patients respond well to steroid therapy. Clinical improvements are also observed with IV immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis. In conclusion, it is now generally accepted that the diagnosis of HE must include encephalopathy characterized by cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric features, such as hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Autoimmune encephalitis and prion disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the similarity of the clinical features of these conditions to those of HE.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Nociplastic pain (NP), classified as a third type of pain alongside nociceptive and neuropathic pain, is chronic pain arising from the amplification of nociceptive stimuli through central sensitization, despite the absence of tissue damage, sensory nerve damage, or disease. An important clinical feature of NP is that it is not only associated with pain but also with sensory hypersensitivity to sound and light and cognitive dysfunction, including mood and attention disorders. Recent studies have suggested that depression and developmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), coexist with NP at high frequency. Additionally, cognitive impairment in individuals with NP may be associated with these psychiatric comorbidities. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on (1) multidimensional evaluation and diagnostic details of abdominal NP in adults with ADHD/ASD; (2) how ADHD drugs and antidepressants are administered when ADHD and depression coexist with NP; and (3) how central sensitization, brain function, and family relationship problems underlying NP are altered by treatments of ADHD and depression. Case presentation Herein, we present the case of a 51-year-old woman with abdominal NP. She developed severe right lower abdominal pain and underwent a thorough medical examination; however, the physical, medical cause remained unknown, making treatment challenging. Additionally, she took time off work as she began to complain of insomnia and anxiety. She was referred to our pain center, where a diagnosis of depression, ADHD, and ASD was confirmed, and treatment with ADHD medication was initiated. While ADHD medications alone did not yield sufficient improvement, a combination of methylphenidate and the antidepressant venlafaxine eventually led to improvements in abdominal NP, depression, ADHD symptoms, central sensitization, and family relationship issues. During treatment, cerebral blood flow in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and parietal cortices also improved. Conclusion The treatment of comorbid depression is important while treating NP, and venlafaxine may be effective, especially in cases of comorbid ADHD/ASD. Screening for developmental disorders and depression is required in patients with abdominal NP.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions.

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

L’examen psychiatrique notait une humeur labile, un mutisme, une insomnie de maintien, un syndrome confusionnel fait d’amimie, de regard figé, d’écholalie et de désorientation temporo-spatiale. L’exploration de la pensée a révélé un cours continu marqué par un délire passionnel à mécanisme hallucinatoire. Ces hallucinations étaient auditives et visuelles en dehors de toute période confusionnelle « il y a des gens qui jouent et qui me demandent de danser et de chanter ». L’examen neurologique était sans particularité. L’imagerie par résonance magnétique cérébrale a objectivé une atrophie cortico sous corticale sévère. Le patient a bénéficié d’un bolus de corticoïdes pendant trois jours puis relayé par voie orale et de l’hydroxychloroquine. Sur le plan psychiatrique, le patient fut traité par du rispéridone comprimé. Conclusion : Le neurolupus chez les sujets jeunes de sexe masculin sont extrêmement rares posant véritablement problème de diagnostic différentiel dans notre contexte. Il doit être recherché systématiquement même en absence de signes neurologiques afin d’améliorer la prise en charge.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual disability (ID), a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by limitations of both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, affects an estimated 1–2% of children. Genetic causes of ID are often accompanied by recognizable syndromal patterns. The vision apparatus is a sensory extension of the brain, and individuals with intellectual disabilities frequently have coexisting abnormalities of ocular structures and the visual pathway system. About one-third of the X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndromes have significant eye or ocular adnexa abnormalities that provide important diagnostic clues. Some XLID syndromes (e.g. Aicardi, cerebrooculogenital, Graham anophthalmia, Lenz, Lowe, MIDAS) are widely known for their characteristic ocular manifestations. Nystagmus, optic atrophy, and strabismus are among the more common, nonspecific, ocular manifestations that contribute to neuro-ophthalmological morbidity. Common dysmorphic oculofacial findings include anophthalmia, microphthalmia, hypertelorism, and abnormalities in the configuration or orientation of the palpebral fissures. Four XLID syndromes with major ocular manifestations (incontinentia pigmenti, Goltz, MIDAS, and Aicardi syndromes) are notable because of male lethality and expression occurring predominantly in females. The majority of the genes associated with XLID and ocular manifestations have now been identified.",

It has a significant impact on populations and is characterized by chronically disturbed sleep and sleep loss, non-refreshing sleep, and heightened arousal in bed. Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, and it is reported that poorer quality of life and medical, neurological, and psychiatric comorbidities disrupt sleep. Sleep difficulties may result from multiple etiologies; however, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying chronic insomnia disorder are not sufficiently understood. Recently, numerous neuroimaging studies have been conducted to investigate the structural or functional derangement in the brains of patients with chronic insomnia disorder. The development of neuroimaging techniques has provided insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that make patients with chronic sleep disturbances vulnerable to cognitive impairment.

In this article, we will explore the optic nerve's detailed anatomy and its various pathological conditions. Optic neuropathy is a broad class of conditions that affect the optic nerve, causing vision loss or impairment. This type of condition can be classified into several subtypes, and the aforementioned ischemic optic neuropathy (NOI) is just one specific example. Optic neuritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision loss. This condition can affect one or both optic nerves and comes in several forms, two of which are the most common: retrobulbar optic neuritis and papillary optic neuritis. Glaucoma is a group of ophthalmologic diseases characterized by progressive damage to the optic nerve, often associated with increased intraocular pressure. Optic atrophy is a condition in which optic nerve tissue deteriorates or dies.",

PNES are not characterized by any specific ictal or postictal EEG abnormalities. Patients with PNES can present with motor or non-motor symptoms, frequently associated with a change in the level of consciousness. PNES duration is variable, often longer than that of epileptic seizures. Prolonged PNES, sometimes termed PNES status, involve continuous or repetitive events that exceed 30 min. Prolonged PNES are often misdiagnosed as an epileptic event and are often inappropriately treated with high doses of antiseizure drugs. In this report, we describe two adolescent patients who presented with prolonged PNES characterized by generalized hypertonic posturing and low levels of consciousness. Despite multiple presentation to the Emergency department, and multiple normal video-EEG, the patients were misdiagnosed with epilepsy and were inappropriately treated with antiseizure medications. Both patients presented psychiatric comorbidity, consisting of a major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, social withdrawal, difficulty of social interaction, and anxious-perfectionist personality traits. The episodes of prolonged PNES gradually declined within 18 months in both patients.",

Most patients presenting with MGC have an identifiable risk factor. The diagnosis of MGC should be suspected in all patients with respiratory failure, particularly those with unclear etiology. Acute management of MGC requires supportive general and ventilatory therapy and institution of measures to improve the neuromuscular blockade. The latter includes plasma exchange or i.v. immunoglobulin, and removal of the offending trigger. The outcome of patients with MGC has improved significantly and the current mortality rate is about 4 to 8%.",

International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) criteria for these disorders, the diagnosis of the primary headache can only be given after secondary causes have been excluded. Furthermore, the proper treatment of these disorders is predicated upon establishing the correct diagnosis; some of the conditions described in this chapter respond dramatically to therapy with indomethacin but not to agents typically prescribed for the other more common primary headaches.

      "abstract": "Objective Neurometabolic disorders are an important group of diseases that mostly are presented in newborns and infants. Neurological manifestations are the prominent signs and symptoms in this group of diseases. Seizures are a common sign and are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs in untreated neurometabolic patients. The onset of symptoms for neurometabolic disorders appears after an interval of normal or near normal growth and development.Additionally, affected children may fare well until a catabolic crisis occurs. Patients with neurometabolic disorders during metabolic decompensation have severe clinical presentation, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This symptom is often fatal but severe neurological insult and regression in neurodevelopmental milestones can result as a prominent sign in patients who survived. Acute symptoms should be immediately treated regardless of the cause. A number of patients with neurometabolic disorders respond favorably and, in some instances, dramatically respond to treatment. Early detection and early intervention is invaluable in some patients to prevent catabolism and normal or near normal neurodevelopmental milestones. This paper discusses neurometabolic disorders, approaches to this group of diseases (from the view of a pediatric neurologist), clinical and neurological manifestations, neuroimaging and electroencephalography findings, early detection, and early treatment.",

      "abstract": "Diseases of the peripheral nervous system are ranking a leading position among other neurological nosologies. And polyneuropathy is known as more prevalent and severe disease. Numerous scientific reports highlight issues on different pathological conditions in relation to polyneuropathy, and in particular intoxications, hypovitaminosis (isolated or as complications of certain pathological processes), infectious and hereditary diseases, paraneoplastic syndromes, metabolic disorders, allergic reactions. These diseases when uncontrolled or untreated may result in the development of complications, among which is polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is relatively not difficult, because the disease is manifested as distal symmetrical sensory and/or motor impairments with transient disorders of autonomic nervous system. Diabetic polyneuropathy, in particular, is a late complication of diabetes mellitus, which determines the prognosis of the disease. Alcoholic polyneuropathy in a form of acute, subacute or chronic current variants is caused by the combined effects of thiamine toxicity and vitamin deficiency. At the same time, dysmetabolic polyneuropathies differ by variability of clinical manifestations and the general developmental patterns of the nerve conduction block that is determined by the peculiarities of degenerative and regenerative processes under different pathogenetic factors. Differential diagnosis of polyneuropathies is mainly based on the detection of somatic pathology and the comparison of the dynamic changes in the course of the diseases and clinical manifestations. The study has demonstrated diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies have clear distinct clinical-neurophysiological patterns. The article also highlights the treatment outcomes of combination therapy with pregabalin for diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies.",

      "title": "Neurological Symptoms and Their Associations With Inflammatory Biomarkers in the Chronic Phase Following Traumatic Brain Injuries",
      "abstract": "The underlying biological mechanisms for neurological symptoms following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain poorly understood. This study investigated the associations between serum inflammatory biomarkers and neurological symptoms in the chronic phase following moderate to severe TBI.The serum interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and the tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α in 72 TBI patients 6 months to 2 years post injury were measured. Neurological symptoms including depression, chronic headache, sleep disturbance, irritability, anxiety, and global neurological disability was assessed. The associations between the biomarkers and the neurological symptoms were assessed using correlation and regression analysis.It was found that the most common post-injury symptom was sleep disturbance (84.7%), followed by chronic headaches (59.7%), irritability (55.6%), and depression (54.2%). TNF-α was a protective factor for chronic headache (OR = 0.473, 95% CI = 0.235-0.952). IL-6 was positively associated with sleep disturbance (r = 0.274, p = 0.021), while IL-5 and IL-12p70 were negatively associated with the degree of global neurological disability (r = -0.325, p = 0.006; r = -0.319, p = 0.007).This study provides preliminary evidence for the association between chronic inflammation with neurological symptoms following a TBI, which suggests that anti-inflammatory could be a potential target for post-TBI neurological rehabilitation. Further research with larger sample sizes and more related biomarkers are still needed, however, to elucidate the inflammatory mechanisms for this association.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease, which commonly presents with extraocular muscle weakness, eyelid ptosis, bulbar dysfunction, and proximal limb weakness. We report an unusual differential diagnosis for myasthenia gravis. Case Report A 56-year-old woman presented with worsening blurry vision, double vision, eyelid droopiness, slurred speech, and fatigable limb weakness, worsening over a 6-month period. On neurological examination, she showed dysarthric speech, ptosis, and proximal limb weakness with preserved reflexes. Myasthenia gravis was considered strongly, but serological and electrodiagnostic testing did not confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. At subsequent visits, the patient developed headaches and downbeating nystagmus, and a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a Chiari type I malformation. Conclusions Chiari type I malformation is an unusual differential for sero-negative myasthenia gravis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, carried out in patients with all classical signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, helps identify this anomaly. Headaches, although a classic feature of Chiari type I malformation, need not be an early manifestation. Eyelid ptosis as a manifestation of Chiari malformation has not been reported in the literature.",

      "abstract": "Though the mechanisms of action of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are not completely understood, these drugs are widely used in treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we have analyzed the literature on the use of IVIG in the treatment of autoimmune diseases of the nervous system in children and discuss the management of patients basing on the recommendation of the European Federation of Neurological Societies. The efficacy of IVIG in children has been shown as first line treatment in Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, dermatomyositis as a second-line drug in the combination with prednisolone or immunosuppressors in patients refractory to treatment with corticosteroids and cytostatics, myasthenic crisis in myasthenia gravis, exacerbations and short-term treatment of severe forms, non-responsiveness to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, multiple sclerosis as second or third line of treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting course with intolerance to standard immunomodulatory therapy, acute multiple encephalomyelitis with no response to the treatment with high doses of corticosteroids, paraneoplastic syndromes, pharmacoresistant epilepsy and autoimmune encephalitis. Because the right choice of the drug plays a key role, in particular, in children, that determines the efficacy and safety of the treatment, we present the main approaches to the choice of the drug and schemes of treatment of autoimmune diseases of the nervous system in children. Несмотря на то что до сих пор механизмы действия внутривенных иммуноглобулинов (ВВИГ) не раскрыты в полной мере, препараты данной группы нашли широкое применение в лечении аутоиммунных заболеваний. В данной обзорной статье приведен анализ имеющихся в медицинской литературе данных о применении ВВИГ в терапии аутоиммунных заболеваний нервной системы детей и обсуждается тактика ведения данных пациентов с учетом рекомендаций Европейской Федерации неврологических сообществ. Эффективность применения ВВИГ у детей была показана в качестве терапии первой линии при синдроме Гийена-Барре, хронической воспалительной демиелинизирующей полинейропатии, мультифокальной моторной нейропатии, а также при дерматомиозите в качестве препаратов второй линии в комбинации с преднизолоном или иммуносупрессантами у пациентов, резистентных к терапии кортикостероидами и цитостатиками; при миастении гравис для лечения миастенического криза, обострений и краткосрочной терапии тяжелых форм, при отсутствии ответа на ингибиторы ацетилхолинэстеразы; при рассеянном склерозе в качестве второй или третьей линии терапии у пациентов с рецидивирующе-ремиттирующим течением при непереносимости общепринятой иммуномодулирующей терапии; остром рассеянном энцефаломиелите при отсутствии ответа на лечение высокими дозами кортикостероидов; оптикомиелите (болезни) Девика при недостаточном ответе на кортикостероиды; при паранеопластических синдромах; при фармакорезистентной эпилепсии и аутоиммунных энцефалитах. Учитывая, что правильный выбор препарата, особенно в педиатрической практике, зачастую имеет ключевое значение, так как во многом определяет эффективность и безопасность проводимой терапии, в статье представлены основные подходы к выбору препарата и схемы терапии аутоиммунных заболеваний нервной системы у детей.",

Review of the literature identifies 13 additional cases of HaNDL in the pediatric population. These cases are reviewed and evidence for possible etiopathogenesis is discussed. This syndrome may mimic much more common conditions such as complicated or hemiplegic migraine, aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or stroke. However, HaNDL differs from complicated or hemiplegic migraine and stroke since CSF pleocytosis is uniformly present. There are many infectious conditions that can present with neurological deficits, headache, and CSF pleocytosis, but the transient nature of the deficits and lack of a consistently identifiable infectious etiology despite extensive evaluations typify HaNDL. This clinical syndrome is underrecognized and underreported. HaNDL remains a diagnosis of exclusion.",

Psychosis can affect the mind in many ways, but usually, we talk about various forms of primary psychosis such as schizophrenia. Clinical experience has shown that the most common cause of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations in patients infected with COVID-19 (or any serious illness), is delirium. Long COVID can be worsened by psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, or dissociative symptoms), and it can also generate dissociative psychotic symptoms in people with vulnerabilities. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is associated with a massively dysfunctional brain chemistry response to medication (typically antipsychotic medication) and/or an inflammatory cascade (from illness or massive overuse of muscles).",

PCNSL in immunocompetent patients is associated with unique diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic issues, and the management of this malignancy is different from that of other forms of extranodal NHL. Characteristic imaging features should be suggestive of the diagnosis, avoidance of corticosteroids, if possible, and early neurosurgical consultation for stereotactic biopsy. Because PCNSL may involve the brain, CSF, and eyes, diagnostic evaluation should include assessment of all of these regions as well as screening for possible occult systemic disease. Resection provides no therapeutic benefit and should be reserved for the rare patient with neurologic deterioration due to brain herniation. Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone is insufficient for durable tumor control and is associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity in patients older than age 60. Neurotoxicity typically is associated with significant cognitive, motor, and autonomic dysfunction, and has a negative impact on quality of life. Chemotherapy and WBRT together improve tumor response rates and survival compared with WBRT alone. Methotrexate-based multiagent chemotherapy without WBRT is associated with similar tumor response rates and survival compared with regimens that include WBRT, although controlled trials have not been performed. The risk of neurotoxicity is lower in patients treated with chemotherapy alone.",

      "title": "First use of ibrutinib for the treatment of <scp>post‐transplant</scp> central nervous system graft‐versus‐host disease",
      "abstract": "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) represents a serious complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant that occurs in 20%–80% of patients. cGVHD likely arises from interactions between different components of the adaptive immune system, including alloreactive dysregulated T and B cells, and the innate immune system, including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, which ultimately promote the formation of profibrotic lesions.1 On rare occasions, these profibrotic pathways may end up being activated in the central nervous system, resulting in central nervous system graft-versus-host disease (CNS-GVHD).2 CNS-GVHD is characterized by cerebrovascular damage and demyelination, causing diverse and non-specific symptoms such as motor and sensory deficits, weakness or aphasia. CNS-GVHD is difficult to distinguish from other chronic neurologic disorders and is considered a diagnosis of exclusion.2 Treating CNS-GVHD is an even greater challenge due to the rarity and paucity of data on its management. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents are most often used as first-line treatment for CNS-GVHD; however, the prognosis for patients with CNS-GHVD that is unresponsive to such therapies remains poor.2, 3 Here, we report a case of CNS-GVHD refractory to steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasmapheresis and rituximab, which was successfully treated with ibrutinib. A 74-year-old female with a history of chronic myeloid leukaemia refractory to numerous tyrosine kinase inhibitors underwent a reduced-intensity haploidentical allogeneic transplant with fludarabine, busulfan, cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of post-transplant cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Three months post-transplant, a bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of CML and BCR-ABL p210 was undetectable on repeat qPCR. However, 11 months post-transplant, she presented to the oncology clinic with right face numbness and left-sided ataxia. On neurologic exam, she displayed decreased sensation to light touch and cold on her right face, dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia of the left upper extremity, decreased vibration sense in her feet and difficulty with tandem gait. Testing of other cranial nerve, motor and sensory functions was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain demonstrated active demyelination of the subcortical white matter, precentral gyrus, midbrain, internal capsule and pons (Figure 1A,B). Lumbar puncture revealed borderline pleocytosis (8 white blood cells) with elevated myelin basic protein (20.7 ng/mL) and negative oligoclonal bands. Infectious workup (including meningitis/encephalitis PCR panel, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and next generation sequencing pathogen testing) were negative. Haematopathological evaluation of CSF revealed no myeloblasts, and flow cytometry revealed no monotypic myeloid population. Serum myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and aquaporin-4 antibodies were not detected. As the findings did not support an aetiology for her neurologic condition, she was diagnosed with post-transplant CNS-GVHD. She was started on a short course of methylprednisolone (1000 mg × 3 days), which resulted in partial symptom reduction. However, within a month, her balance and weakness problems recurred with a repeat brain MRI confirming ongoing demyelination. Over the next month, additional treatment attempts included 5 rounds of plasmapheresis followed by IVIG, as well as rituximab (1000 mg × 2 days) plus methylprednisolone (1000 mg × 5 days), all of which failed to prevent progressive demyelination on MRI (Figure 1C). After being tapered off steroids for 2 months, she had worsening eye, mouth and skin cGVHD. She was started on ibrutinib (420 mg daily) for steroid refractory cGVHD with the involvement of the CNS. However, the dose was lowered due to patient-reported side effects, including stiff joints and ecchymosis. Within 2 months, her symptoms improved, and follow-up brain MRI demonstrated no further active demyelination. She has been on ibrutinib for over a year (maintaining a stable dose of 280 mg daily for the last 3 months) with an ongoing response both clinically and radiographically (Figure 1A–C). The majority of case studies on CNS-GVHD to date have shown that the administration of corticosteroids alone can effectively and quickly improve neurological symptoms.4-6 However, it remains unclear how to best manage CNS-GVHD that is refractory to front-line immunosuppressive therapies. To our knowledge, our case represents the first-ever report of using ibrutinib to treat CNS-GVHD. In a review of 34 patients with CNS-GVHD who received immunosuppressive therapy, Ruggiu et al.3 highlight other treatments besides corticosteroids that have been administered, including plasmapheresis, IVIG, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolic acid, methotrexate, etoposide and calcineurin inhibitors; these attempts were associated with varying degrees of response. Our patient had a significant response to ibrutinib. Therefore, we believe ibrutinib is another important salvage therapy option available to patients with CNS-GVHD. Our patient was unresponsive to traditional means of treating cGVHD. For multiple reasons, ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), was chosen as an alternative therapy. First, ibrutinib achieves significant CNS penetrance, with one preclinical study suggesting that it can cross the blood–brain barrier in less than 0.3 h.7 Furthermore, it has the unique ability to inhibit both BTK in B cells and interleukin-2–inducible T-cell kinase in T cells. It has a wide range of applications in immune-mediated disorders: it is FDA-approved for use in steroid refractory cGVHD and also has activity in primary CNS lymphoma.8, 9 BTKi's are now being studied in multiple sclerosis, another chronic neuroinflammatory disorder, for their possible remyelination effect.10 Ibrutinib possesses a combination of qualities that are ideal for treating a CNS demyelinating disease, as it can rapidly enter the CNS, systemically temper an overactive immune response and potentially even reverse neuronal damage. The pathogenesis of chronic CNS-GVHD is still being elucidated. A leading hypothesis posits that chronic CNS-GHVD onset stems from sequential CNS infiltration of donor CD8+ T cells, donor CD4+ T cells and donor bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs). Due to this activation of lymphocytes in the brain, IFN-γ is upregulated, which increases major histocompatibility complex II expression on BMDMs, promoting synaptic attack.11 One reason why ibrutinib may be particularly beneficial in CNS-GVHD is its capacity to modulate macrophage function, which also relies on BTK pathways. In fact, a separate study was able to show that ibrutinib limited the phagocytosis of rituximab-coated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells by macrophages.12 It is feasible that ibrutinib could exert a similar effect on host BMDMs to alleviate neuroinflammation in CNS-GVHD as well. Overall, further basic research studies to elucidate the actual therapeutic mechanism of ibrutinib and prospective clinical studies to delineate the role of BTKi's in treating rare cases of steroid refractory CNS-GVHD are warranted.

Most cases of HE can be attributed to complications during the perinatal period in children, and in adults HE mostly results from cardiac arrest or asphyxia, with approximately half a million cases per year of HE in the United States [1]. Hypoxic encephalopathy is one of the most important and devastating clinical manifestations of the postcardiac-arrest syndrome (PCAS) characterized mainly by postcardiac-arrest brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, and a systemic ischemia-reperfusion response [2].

Mania and psychotic episodes are less commonly described, and there have been limited studies on the long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of H1N1 infection. Here, we report a case of H1N1 infection with concurrent onset of acute manic and psychotic symptoms. Despite completing a full course of the antiviral medication oseltamivir, the patient's behaviour worsened over the next four weeks and he required readmission for psychiatric treatment. Based on the temporal sequence of events, we considered the possibility that these symptoms were sequelae of Novel influenza A (H1N1) infection. Moreover, the manic symptoms persisted weeks after the acute infection had abated, which gives rise to the consideration of long-lasting direct or indirect neuronal insult by the influenza virus. However, it is also possible that his symptoms may have represented a primary psychiatric disorder precipitated by or coincident with the viral infection. After treatment with antipsychotic medication and a mood stabiliser, his manic and psychotic symptoms became significantly attenuated. His behaviour improved considerably such that he was able to return to school. Medications were stopped after one month of outpatient follow-up at his behest. Four months after discharge, he was completely free of symptoms and was performing well in school. Treatment of influenza with antiviral medications has been shown to reduce the rate of complications. However, the effectiveness of antiviral treatment to prevent influenza-associated neuropsychiatric sequelae is unknown.",

HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?Altered behaviour is common in children and has many causes.In the general clinic setting, it is important to pick up common clinical mimics of encephalopathy that can be managed without immediate referral to the hospital.These include post-ictal drowsiness from simple febrile seizures, and metabolic derangements such as hypoglycaemia.Conversely, it is also important to identify red flags in the history and physical examination that necessitate either activation of emergency services or an urgent referral to the neurologist for further workup.In particular, encephalitis accounts for a significant proportion of encephalopathy cases that persist beyond 24 hours, and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.(3) Arriving at an accurate diagnosis for the underlying cause is critical because many causes are reversible, and early specific treatment confers a better prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by hypoalbuminemia, severe proteinuria, and peripheral edema, frequently in conjunction with hyperlipidemia. Individuals usually show symptoms of weariness and swelling, but no signs of serious liver damage or cardiac failure. With characteristic medical symptoms and evidence of hypoalbuminemia and severe proteinuria, NS can be diagnosed. The majority of NS episodes are classified as unexplained or primary; the most prevalent histopathological subgroups of primary NS in people are focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and membraneous nephropathy. Thrombosis of the veins with high cholesterol levels is a significant NS risk. Acute renal damage and infection are further possible side effects. The pathobiochemistry of NS involves alterations in genes that affect the selectivity of the kidneys and abnormalities in proteins related to podocytes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that influence these processes is crucial to developing specific and targeted therapeutic approaches. The need for invasive renal biopsies throughout the diagnosis process may be lessened by the development of non-invasive nephrotic syndrome biomarkers, such as microRNAs. Corticosteroids are frequently used as the initial line of defense in NS treatment. However, some individuals need other treatments since a resistant type of NS also exists. The use of calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab is mentioned in the text, along with current research to identify safer and more efficient therapeutic choices. The complicated kidney condition NS has several underlying causes and symptoms. For the diagnosis of this ailment as well as the creation of focused therapies, an understanding of the pathophysiology and the identification of possible biomarkers are essential.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus has a high incidence in general population and goes by high morbidity by specific micro vascular pathology in the retina, renal glomerul and peripheral nerves. In type 1 DM, intensive therapy can prevent or delay the development of long-term complications associated with DM but hypoglycaemia especially severe hypoglycaemia defined, as a low blood glucose resulting in stupor, seizure, or unconsciousness that precludes self-treatment is a serious threat. Hypoglycaemia that may preferentially harm neurons in the medial temporal region, specifically the hippocampus, is a potential danger for the brain cognitive function which several studies failed to detect any significant effects, whereas others indicated an influence on it. A young diabetic case presented here with severe cognitive defect. Great number of severe hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic attacks and convulsion episodes were described in his medical history.Neuroradiologic findings on CT and MRI, pointed that global cerebral atrophy that is incompatible with his age. Brain perfusion studies (SPECT, (99m)Tc-labeled HMPAO) also showed that there were severe perfusion defects at superior temporal region and less perfusion defects at gyrus cingulum in frontal region. These regions are related with memory processing. Severe cognitive defect in this patient seems to be closely related these changes and no another reason was found to explain except the repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes.",

      "title": "Autonomic Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results not only in motor and sensory deficits but also in autonomic dysfunctions. The disruption of connections between higher brain centers and the spinal cord, or the impaired autonomic nervous system itself, manifests a broad range of autonomic abnormalities. This includes compromised cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary, gastrointestinal, thermoregulatory, and sexual activities. These disabilities evoke potentially life‐threatening symptoms that severely interfere with the daily living of those with SCI. In particular, high thoracic or cervical SCI often causes disordered hemodynamics due to deregulated sympathetic outflow. Episodic hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia develops as a result of massive sympathetic discharge often triggered by unpleasant visceral or sensory stimuli below the injury level. In the pelvic floor, bladder and urethral dysfunctions are classified according to upper motor neuron versus lower motor neuron injuries; this is dependent on the level of lesion. Most impairments of the lower urinary tract manifest in two interrelated complications: bladder storage and emptying. Inadequate or excessive detrusor and sphincter functions as well as detrusor‐sphincter dyssynergia are examples of micturition abnormalities stemming from SCI. Gastrointestinal motility disorders in spinal cord injured‐individuals are comprised of gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, and diminished propulsive transit along the entire gastrointestinal tract. As a critical consequence of SCI, neurogenic bowel dysfunction exhibits constipation and/or incontinence. Thus, it is essential to recognize neural mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying various complications of autonomic dysfunctions after SCI. This overview provides both vital information for better understanding these disorders and guides to pursue novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate secondary complications. © 2014 American Physiological Society.

      "abstract": "Noncompliance in the absence of any of the mental disorders already described may be treated with education or counseling. In the absence of other mental disorder, including Adjustment Disorder, the goals of the therapist are generally to provide information and counseling, be an objective observer, recognize problems in communication and facilitate their resolution, and avoid overdiagnosis. Treatment of mental disorder in the absence of any other diagnosable mental disorder should be based upon simple counseling with exploration of possible family or environmental stresses. Supportive treatment, along with relevant education for the patient when such problems or crises develop, is almost always helpful. Institutionalization or other infantilizing procedures are never necessary for the treatment of Borderline Intellectual Functioning per se. Much of the frustration of the person with Borderline Intellectual Functioning is related to how he or she is treated by an uninformed or prejudiced public.",

      "abstract": "Im vorliegenden Abschnitt werden das Phaenomen der Muedigkeit, die Fahrtauglichkeit aelterer Menschen und das Interaktionsverhalten behandelt. Muedigkeit ist eine subjektive Befindlichkeit. Von ihr ist die Leistungsfaehigkeit betroffen. Ursache der Muedigkeit ist Beanspruchung. Beim Autofahren entsteht psychische Muedigkeit aufgrund kognitiver Prozesse. Einen Unfall als Muedigkeitsunfall klassifizieren zu koennen, ist nur moeglich, wenn der Fahrer zugibt, dass er eingeschlafen ist, und wenn die Rekonstruktion der vorangegangenen Fahrt keine andere Ursache plausibel erscheinen laesst, etwa bei einer hohen Lenkzeitueberschreitung eines Lkw-Fahrers. Eine woechentliche Arbeitszeit ueber 60 Stunden, das Vorliegen einer Schlafstoerung, eine schlechte Schlafqualitaet, ein hoher Anteil an Fahrten zwischen Mitternacht und 6 Uhr, weniger als 5 Stunden Nachtschlaf und Schichtarbeit/Nachtarbeit sind Risikofaktoren fuer Muedigkeitsunfaelle. Mit zunehmendem Alter wird das Fahren weniger sicher. Insbesondere im Hochbetagtenbereich spiegelt sich dies auch in der Unfallstatistik wider. Zumindest bis zum Alter von etwa 70 bis 75 Jahren scheinen altersbedingte Beeintraechtigungen noch erfolgreich durch eine angepasste Fahrweise kompensiert zu werden. Dies ist bei der Begutachtung der Fahreignung mit zu ueberpruefen. Es mangelt derzeit an individualisierten Schulungsprogrammen, mit denen gezielt alterskritische Fahraufgaben trainiert und kompensatorische Strategien vermittelt werden. Es fehlen auch Moeglichkeiten, die Fahrtauglichkeit billig, anonym und ohne Konsequenzen ueberpruefen lassen zu koennen. Ruecksichtsloses Fahren stellt genauso wie kooperatives Fahren ein Interaktionsverhalten im Strassenverkehr dar. Ruecksichtslose Fahrer versuchen, ihren eigenen Vorteil durchzusetzen und verstossen damit gegen Regeln, die ein bestimmtes Verhalten vorschreiben oder verbieten. Auf der Opferseite kommt es zu Behinderungen und Gefaehrdungen, die zu Angst und Aerger fuehren. Beim kooperativen Fahren verzichten Fahrer auf ihr eigenes Recht, um einem anderen Fahrer einen Vorteil zu gewaehren. Fuer ruecksichtsloses und kooperatives Verhalten werden unterschiedliche Faktoren und Ursachen benannt. Es wird nach soziodemographischen Merkmalen und Persoenlichkeitscharakteristika von auffaelligen Fahrern gesucht, andere Autoren machen allgemeine soziale und gesellschaftliche Einfluesse verantwortlich und wieder andere sehen ruecksichtloses Fahren als Folge der Kommunikationsbedingungen im Strassenverkehr. Sowohl ruecksichtslose als auch kooperative Interaktionsmuster sind fuer die beteiligten Fahrer und den Gesamtverkehr sicherheitsrelevant. Zur Gesamtaufnahme siehe ITRD D369114. (KfV/K)",

      "abstract": "Unawareness of deficits caused by brain damage or neurodegeneration, termed anosognosia, has been demonstrated in a number of different neurological conditions. Clinical observation suggests that unawareness paradoxically can be accompanied by signs of understanding or representation of deficit, but not explicitly expressed. Such \"implicit awareness,\" an apparent oxymoron, is implied by or inferred from actions or statements of the person with neurological disorder. In the current paper, we review clinical observations and experimental evidence which suggest the occurrence of implicit awareness in dementia and hemiplegia, and explore the clinical and theoretical implications of this phenomenon. We present a theoretical framework to understand implicit awareness in these two conditions.",

At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain‐Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy’s disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.",

Bien que des progres considerables aient ete faits dans la comprehension de la physiopathologie de ces maladies et le developpement de traitements adaptes, un nombre important de patients ne repondent pas (ou pas suffisamment) aux traitements, et developpent des effets secondaires. De plus, les cliniciens ne peuvent a l’heure actuelle pas predire quel patient va repondre a un traitement precis.Nous presentons ici les resultats de nos travaux entrepris chez les patients souffrant de schizophrenie et chez les patients bipolaires. Les sujets souffrant d’un premier episode psychotique presentent des marqueurs de perturbations inflammatoires et des marqueurs d’infections anciennes compares aux sujets sains, en particulier une exposition au parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Ces marqueurs ne permettent toutefois pas a l’heure actuelle de predire la reponse aux traitements conventionnels ou a des therapies ciblees, ni l’evolution ulterieure de la maladie, et sont retrouves pour certains aussi bien dans la schizophrenie que dans le trouble bipolaire. Dans une population de patients stabilises souffrant de schizophrenie, 28% presentent une inflammation peripherique. Cette inflammation est fortement associee a l’obesite abdominale et au syndrome metabolique, mais egalement a la consommation d’antidepresseurs sans que le sens de la causalite puisse etre etabli a ce jour. L’obesite abdominale a ete retrouvee chez 21% des patients et le syndrome metabolique chez 24%. Ces chiffres sont deux fois plus importants que dans la population Francaise et plus de 80% des patients ne recoivent pas de traitements adaptes. Cette inflammation peripherique n’est pas associee a la symptomatologie positive ou negative, mais a un declin cognitif touchant le fonctionnement intellectuel general des patients souffrant de schizophrenie.Ces resultats ouvrent la piste de nouveaux traitements. Les anti-inflammatoires ont montre leur efficacite dans les troubles psychiatriques severes, ils necessitent toutefois une meilleure caracterisation du profil inflammatoire de base pour identifier les patients qui pourraient etre bon repondeurs, et leur efficacite pourrait etre d’autant plus grande qu’ils sont administres en debut de maladie, voire avant le declenchement du trouble. Le rapport benefice/risque doit egalement etre evalue. De nombreux antipsychotiques et le valproate ont montre une activite anti-toxoplasmique qui pourrait etre associee a un effet protecteur de la rechute depressive dans le trouble bipolaire. Leur efficacite chez les patients toxopositifs souffrant de schizophrenie reste a determiner.Les donnees du present travail suggerent qu’une proportion importante des patients souffrant de schizophrenie presente des marqueurs inflammatoires et infectieux qui pourraient orienter les traitements medicamenteux ou non-medicamenteux. La meilleure caracterisation du profil immuno-inflammatoire des patients pourrait donc permettre d’optimiser leur prise en charge et d’ameliorer leur pronostic dans le cadre d’une medecine personnalisee.",

The most common cause of spinal cord disease in the course of HIV infection is AIDS-associated vacuolar myelopathy (VM; Snider et al. 1983; Simpson and Tagliati 1994; Petito et al. 1985). Although VM is strictly a pathological diagnosis, the term VM is used at large to indicate the clinical manifestation of primary myelopathy associated with AIDS. VM has fairly typical clinical features and is potentially disabling, but its symptoms often overlap with those of neuropathy or other neurological disorders associated with late stage AIDS. This may explain, at least in part, why VM tends to be clinically underrecognized.",

      "abstract": "Finding promising cures for migraine: targeting neuropeptides Migraine is not only a headache.It is a complex condition characterised by unilateral head pain and is usually associated with multiple symptoms, such as nausea, insomnia, and sensitivity to light and sound.A report from the Global Burden of Disease Headache Collaborators in 2018 states that migraine is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting 144% of the global population.The extra stress that comes with the COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide lockdown might make it exceptionally difficult for people with migraine in 2020.Indeed, according to research based on 25 million migraine attacks from Migraine Buddy, a tracking app for migraine sufferers, stress-related migraine attacks were 30À50% higher in 2020 than during the peak of the 2019 Christmas season.Thus, treatment and prevention of migraine now represents a particularly important topic.There is no cure for migraine, and the causes of migraine remain unknown.Evidence suggests that migraine is a genetic neurological disease resulting from pathological alterations in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, which then triggers the release of the neurotransmitters serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), nitric oxide, and neuropeptides (eg, calcitonin gene-related peptide [CGRP] and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide [PACAP]).However, although there have been rapid advances in migraine research, details about the pathophysiology of migraine are mostly unclear which impedes the development of mechanismbased therapy for this disease.Conventional medications to treat migraines are over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, aspirin, and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).In 1992, GlaxoSmithKline (Middlesex, UK) launched the first tryptamine-based 5-HT agonist, sumatriptan, for acute migraine treatment.More triptans were later approved by the US Food and Drug administration (FDA).They are highly effective at relieving moderate to severe migraine pain in patients that do not respond to NSAIDs.However, triptans are not effective in all patients, and can cause major side-effects in individuals with cardiovascular diseases due to their vasoconstriction effect and inhibition of CGRP release.To avoid the adverse effects of 5-HT stimulation, Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA) developed a 5-HT 1F receptor agonist called Lasmiditan, which was approved by the US FDA in October, 2019.Advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of migraine, especially the role of an important trigeminal sensory neuropeptide, CGRP, have promoted alternative approaches to migraine therapy.Increased levels of CGRP were first associated with migraine by Peter Goadsby and co-authors as early as 1988 in Annals of Neurology.It is now thought that CGRP-induced neurogenic inflammation might lead to peripheral and central pain sensitisation.In 2004, Jes Olesen and colleagues first reported in New England Journal of Medicine that a CGRP antagonist, BIBN 4096 BS (olcegepant), was effective in treating patients with acute migraine.This finding led to the development of a class of CGRP antagonists referred to as gepants.Compared with",

Coexistence of MG and epilepsy seems not simply due to chance association. MG was not infrequently considered as a complication of long-term anticonvulsant therapy. In National Taiwan University Hospital, we found 4 out of 251 MG patients who suffered from epilepsy. MG manifestations of these patients did not differ from those in MG patients without epilepsy. There were increased levels of antibody to acetylcholine receptors and association with thymus hyperplasia or thyroid disease. In the literature, we found 25 reported cases with MG and epilepsy. No specific type of epilepsy was linked to coexistence of MG and epilepsy. Possible causes for MG in association with epilepsy are multiple, including drug-induced depression at the neuromuscular junction, anticonvulsant-related immunological changes, and unknown common mechanism to both diseases.",

Among the neuropsychiatric disorders encountered in patients with SLE, cerebrovascular disease has been a relatively rare complication. The diagnosis and management of CNS-lupus is difficult because of the lack of useful diagnostic methods. If, cerebrovascular involvement is suspected, then aggressive treatment such as high dose steroid, immunosuppressive therapy, plasma exchange, may be required to reduce high mortality rate. We experienced 2 cases cerebrovascular disease occurring in SLE patients which presented with various neuropsychiatric manifestations.

      "abstract": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is characterized by behavioral or cognitive change from baseline for at least 30 minutes with EEG evidence of seizures. Categorized into complex partial status epilepticus (with lateralized seizures), and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus (bilateral diffuse synchronous seizures), there is debate regarding the diagnosis and morbidity of NCSE. Because EEG is needed for diagnosis, only a high index of suspicion leads to a request for the study, whereas EEG is often unavailable after hours or on weekends. Furthermore, the cognitive changes during NCSE are often incorrectly ascribed to a postictal state, intoxication, psychogenic or psychotic states, and mental retardation. Regarding categorization, present classifications address EEG features but fail to distinguish among depths of coma. Deeply comatose patients (with coma etiologies that themselves carry poor prognoses) are mixed with lightly obtunded patients with no morbidity, confusing the prognosis. Thus, a classification that subsumes depth of coma, and possibly etiology, is sorely warranted. Regarding treatment, comatose NCSE patients treated with benzodiazepines may worsen, whereas generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus patients may suffer iatrogenically from aggressive treatment (hypotension and respiratory depression) necessitating balancing the potential neurologic morbidity of NCSE against the possible morbidity of IV antiepileptic drugs. A high index of suspicion is needed to initiate EEG studies. Better stratification of level of consciousness will be needed to distinguish among morbidity due to underlying conditions, treatment, and the effects of status epilepticus, proper.",

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "Advances in the Treatment of Secondary CNS Lymphoma",
      "abstract": "Secondary involvement of the CNS by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in less than 1% to more than 10% of patients with DLBCL depending on the presence or absence of five risk factors that compose the International Prognostic Index (age, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, poor performance status, advanced stage, and involvement of one extranodal site). Involvement of the kidneys and/or adrenal glands has been found to represent a site-specific additional risk factor for secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL). Other risk models have been proposed but not validated. It is also likely that molecular features of the tumor (eg, presence of MYC or BCL2 rearrangements, double-hit lymphomas) will add to or substitute for these clinical risk factors in the near future. SCNSL occurs early (frequently within weeks to months) after diagnosis of systemic disease; can affect the brain (or spinal cord and cranial nerves), the meninges, or both; and until recently, was almost always fatal. Because progression or relapse in the CNS occurs this early after diagnosis, most investigators believe that a significant number of patients prone to develop SCNSL harbor lymphoma cells in the brain parenchyma or the CSF at the time of diagnosis. Modern state-of-the-art techniques like magnetic resonance imaging or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of CSF are much more sensitive in detecting SCNSL compared with clinical judgment, computed tomography scans, or microscopic interpretation of cytospin smears and probably would allow documentation of CNS involvement in an unknown but potentially significant number of patients scoring as CNS negative when traditional methodology is used. As a first step, however, consensus is needed regarding which patients are considered at high enough risk to warrant CNS-specific diagnostic approaches that will likely yield negative results in the majority of patients, will create discomfort, if not more serious adverse effects, in some patients, and will increase costs. The ability to identify patients with documented CNS disease could prompt immediate management with a CNS-specific treatment protocol, whereas patients who are CNS negative by magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis (for instance) would receive immunochemotherapy like any other patient with DLBCL. Alternatively, the highest risk group might be candidates for CNS prophylaxis. With most retrospective analyses showing no benefit of intrathecal (IT) injections of cytotoxic drugs (methotrexate [MTX], cytarabine [Ara-C], prednisone, or combinations thereof), this prophylactic strategy can no longer be generally be recommended. If deemed necessary, more complex and more toxic approaches, such as administration of systemic high-dose MTX or combinations of cytotoxic drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) as pioneered with the French doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone regimen, should be considered. Treatment of SCNSL with IT injections, whole-brain radiotherapy, or systemic administration of cytotoxic drugs that do not cross the BBB has largely been ineffective. Only when repeated courses of high-dose MTX and Ara-C were introduced did patients begin to show measurable benefit and survive significantly longer; cure, however, remained the exception to the rule. Until today, virtually all other drugs known to cross the BBB (procarbazine, etoposide, ifosfamide, thiotepa, carmustine [BCNU], and others) have been used mostly in combination with MTX and/or Ara-C to further improve results. As with MTX and Ara-C, most other drugs seem to be most effective at high doses, necessitating transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Consequently, the most recent and successful protocols to treat primary and secondary CNS lymphoma consist of complex treatment algorithms encompassing two or more courses of high-dose MTX and/or Ara-C administered together with other BBB-crossing agents, followed by high-dose therapy combining BBB-crossing agents like BCNU, thiotepa, busulfan, oretoposide,whichcanbedoseescalatediftransplantationofhematopoietic stem cells ensues. The first prospective phase II study demonstrating the potential of this strategy was reported by Korfel et al. Patients up to age 65 years received induction chemotherapy with high-dose MTX, ifosfamide, and dexamethasone followed by high-dose Ara-C, thiotepa, and dexamethasone. Responding patients were consolidated with highdose therapy consisting of BCNU, thiotepa, and etoposide and transplantation of autologous blood stem cells. With this approach, the 2-year treatment failure rate was 49% 19% and the 2-year overall survival rate was 63% 19%. Another study was reported by Doorduyn et al in 2012; this study, which is not fully published yet, is of particular interest because for the first time rituximab was given with the cytotoxic agents. Because many patients with lymphoma experiencing relapse in the CNS had received rituximab as part of conventional first-line therapy until shortly before relapse and intravenous rituximab does not result in significant therapeutic concentrations in the CNS when the BBB is intact, early protocols including high-dose therapy/ASCT did not use rituximab or any other lymphoma-directed antibody. After it was appreciated that rituximab monotherapy can induce short-lived remissions in patients with CNS disease and thus must be able to penetrate into the CNS of JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY E D I T O R I A L VOLUME 33 NUMBER 33 NOVEMBER 2",

      "abstract": "Mental retardation (RM) and autism spectrum disorde rs (ASD) are mental illnesses that severely impair individual development and have serious consequence s that affect both family and community. The freque ncy of such illnesses is increasing, calling for a unitary collective effort towards diagnose and treatment. The study involved 62 patients diagnosed with RM and/or ASD, as sociated with anemia, hearing or sight impairments, epilepsy and also 14 cases of viral hepatitis type B. The study aimed to corroborate clinical information with paraclinical evidence in order to survey individual pati ent health evolution. Tests showed that patients wi th intellectual disabilities, whether receiving neuroleptic treatme nt or not, are frequently afflicted by anemia and w ater imbalances and very often exhibit metabolic acidosis. Su ch identified metabolic abnormalities should be jus tified by genetic and/or environmental factors. The complexit y of autism spectrum disorders etiology invokes the multifactorial character of these diseases.",

      "title": "Prevalence, Causes and Management of Encephalitis",
      "abstract": "Encephalitis is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and permanent neurological disability in both adults and children. The term \"encephalitis\" literally means inflammation of part or all of the \"brain\" or the brain parenchyma. Encephalitis affects people of all ages; however, the incidence is higher in the pediatric population. Although both genders are affected, most studies showed slight dominance in men. There are two main types with different causes: primary or infectious encephalitis can develop when a fungus, virus, or bacteria infects the brain and accounts for approximately 70% of confirmed cases of encephalitis, and secondary or post-infectious encephalitis when the immune system is active and reacts. to a previous infection and mistakenly attacks the brain. The clinical manifestations depend on whether the brain parenchyma or the meninges are predominantly involved and cause an encephalitic or meningitis syndrome. Diagnostic tests should include a lumbar puncture, an MRI of the brain, and an EEG for suspected encephalitis. In encephalitis, a broad differential diagnosis, both infectious and non-infectious, should be considered. These alternatives include malignancy, autoimmune or paraneoplastic diseases (eg, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis), brain abscess, drug-induced tuberculosis or delirium, neurosyphilis, or bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or helminthic encephalitis. Antiviral medications, such as intravenous acyclovir, are often given at the initial diagnosis of encephalitis before the cause is known. Acyclovir is the best treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis. If medication can be started soon after symptoms appear, the chance of a full recovery is much higher.",

He had received chemotherapy for histiocytosis, diagnosed at the age of 3.5 years. No evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement was found. He was diagnosed as having NCSE and following anticonvulsant therapy the headache and EEG abnormality disappeared completely within 24 hours. Headache and seizure disorder may coexist in different situations; to our knowledge this maybe the first report of NCSE with headache as a sole manifestation.

The clinical presentations of NP-C are variable which include visceral symptoms, neurologic symptoms and psychiatric symptoms. Psychosis is the most common psychiatric manifestation of NP-C and is indistinguishable from a typical psychosis presentation of schizophrenia. The common psychotic presentations in NP-C include visual hallucinations, delusions, auditory hallucinations and thought disorders. Psychosis symptoms are more common in adult or adolescent-onset forms compared with pediatric-onset forms. The underlying pathophysiology of psychosis in NP-C is most probably due to dysconnectivity particularly between frontotemporal connectivity and subcortical structures. NP-C sometimes is mistaken for schizophrenia which causes delay in treatment due to lack of awareness and literature review. This review aims to summarize the relevant case reports on psychosis symptoms in NP-C and discuss the genetics and pathophysiology underlying the condition.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies.",

These attacks can occur at any time of the day and can be accompanied by a loss of muscle tone. A plethora of data indicates that narcolepsy is caused by a lack of orexin, an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of the sleep cycle. Normal levels of orexin are needed for the correct function of different processes in the body, including feeding, cardiovascular regulation, emotions, and locomotion. The pathogenesis of narcolepsy has been debated for many years. It has been suggested that genetic, autoimmune, or infectious processes may be involved. An important aspect in the etiology of narcolepsy is some reports demonstrating a correlation between its onset and infections or H1N1 vaccination.",

      "abstract": "Актуальність. Сепсис, як реакція організму на інфекцію, включає такий етап розвитку, як синдром поліорганної недостатності (СПОН). Мозкова дисфункція в 70 % випадків є одним з перших симптомів сепсис-асоційованого СПОН, ще до клінічних проявів в інших системах життєзабезпечення. Сепсис-асоційована енцефалопатія — мультифокальне порушення функцій головного мозку за умови наявності інфекції, що супроводжується проявами системного запалення, але без клінічних і лабораторних доказів прямої причетності інфекції до пошкодження головного мозку. Залежно від критеріїв, покладених в основу діагностики, церебральна дисфункція-недостатність може бути виявлена в усіх хворих із сепсисом. Ступінь її вираженості корелює зі зростанням тяжкості септичного процесу. Сепсис-асоційована дисфункція-недостатність може бути незалежним предиктором летального кінця. Тяжкість церебральної дисфункції-недостатності коливається від летаргії і/або дезорієнтації до коми. Мета: вивчення впливу терапії відповідно до головних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» із додатковою нейропротекцією Гліатиліном на перебіг септичного процесу й вираженість енцефалопатії в структурі синдрому поліорганної недостатності. Матеріали та методи. За період 2010–2015 рр. нами проведено контрольоване проспективне рандомізоване когортне дослідження на клінічній базі кафедри анестезіології та інтенсивної терапії ДЗ «Дніпропетровська медична академія МОЗ України» і на базі відділення інтенсивної терапії сепсису КП «Дніпропетровська обласна клінічна лікарня ім. І.І. Мечникова» ДОР». У дослідження було включено 22 пацієнти. У всіх хворих було проведено рутинні лабораторні дослідження для визначення рівня клінічних і біохімічних маркерів системного запалення й органних дисфункцій за шкалами SOFA і LIFE. Для оцінки стану свідомості використовували шкалу коми Глазго. Концентрацію цитокінів (фактор некрозу пухлини α, інтерлейкін-1, інтерлейкін-4, інтерферон α) у сироватці крові вивчали імуноферментним методом. Базисна інтенсивна терапія здійснювалася відповідно до основних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» з додатковим використанням нейропротекторного препарату Гліатиліну (холіну альфосцерат) 1000–3000 мг на добу внутрішньовенно, розчиненого в 0,9% розчині натрію хлориду, протягом 5–10 днів. Дослідження показників проводилося в чотири етапи: на 1-шу, 3-тю, 5-ту, 7-му добу. Результати. Узагальнюючи результати дослідження, можливо сказати, що на п’яту й сьому добу були відсутні клінічні прояви синдрому системної запальної відповіді в понад 75 % хворих; зменшилася тяжкість стану за APACHE II на 72,5 і 74,5 % (p &lt; 0,001) і ступінь вираженості синдрому поліорганної недостатності за SOFA в 9 разів (p &lt; 0,001) відповідно до етапів дослідження. Церебральна недостатність, оцінена за шкалою коми Глазго, становила 15 балів на п’яту й сьому добу дослідження, що відповідало стану ясної свідомості в понад 75 % хворих. Зазначене спостерігалося на тлі тенденції до збалансованості активності прозапальних і протизапальних ланок цитокінової системи, про що свідчили максимальні значення фактора некрозу пухлини α та інтерферону α на п’яту добу спостереження при зниженні концентрації інтерлейкіну-1 на 55,8 % щодо фону. Прогнозована летальність у пацієнтів другої групи становила 51 %, фактична летальність — 7,5 %. Отже, шляхом проведення даного варіанта інтенсивної терапії вдалося знизити передбачувану летальність на 43,5 %.",

Emphasis in this study was on mild trauma: fewer than half of the sample had been rendered unconscious in the injury of record, and a third of the cases were of whiplash type, with no loss of consciousness (LOC) and no remembered headstrike. These concomitant lesions comprise the perilymph fistula syndrome (PLFS) with a unique profile of neurological, perceptual, and cognitive deficits resembling a post-concussion injury. a complete description of the clinical picture is given, including psychological, cognitive and diagnostic tests, and the outcome of bedrest vs. surgical management. PLFS can arise from minor trauma, fistula are frequently bilateral (71/102), a mild sensorineural hearing loss is of variable occurrence (53%). secondary hydrops is not uncommon, and women appear more vulnerable than men for developing the syndrome. As based upon combined laboratory techniques and clinical symptomology. fistula were correctly predicted in 61 of 65 laser-operated ears. the positional vertigo component of PLFS was in all cases managed according to a special physical therapy program utilizing exercises for vestibular symptom habituation.

Discussion / Conclusion: This case report underlines the need of a multidisciplinary approach to the adolescent with behaviour disturbances. The suspicion of an organic disease must always be kept in mind, and laboratory and imaging studies conducted to the possibility of a inflammatory neurological disorder, both infectious or immune. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is mainly a cause of respiratory disease but has the potential of extra pulmonary complications, being the neurological the most frequent of these.

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

Estimates suggest that the prevalence rate for depression among HIV-infected individuals is three times that of the general population. The association between HIV and clinical depression is complex; however, chronic activation of inflammatory mechanisms, which disrupt central nervous system (CNS) function, may contribute to this association. Disruptions in CNS function can result in cognitive disorders, social withdrawal, fatigue, apathy, psychomotor impairment, and sleep disturbances, which are common manifestations in depression and HIV alike. Interestingly, the parasympathetic system-associated vagus nerve (VN) has primary homeostatic properties that restore CNS function following a stress or inflammatory response. Unfortunately, about 30% of adults with HIV are resistant to standard psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments for depression, thus suggesting the need for alternative treatment approaches. VN stimulation (VNS) and its benefits as a treatment for depression have been well documented, but remain unexplored in the HIV population. Historically, VNS has been delivered using a surgically implanted device; however, transcutanous VNS (tVNS) with nonsurgical auricular technology is now available. Although it currently lacks Food and Drug Administration approval in the US, evidence suggests several advantages of tVNS, including a reduced side-effect profile when compared to standard treatments and comparable results to implantable VNS in treating depression. Therefore, tVNS could offer an alternative for managing depression in HIV via regulating CNS function; moreover, tVNS may be useful for treatment of other symptoms common in HIV. From this, implications for nursing research and practice are provided. Keywords: tVNS, depression, HIV, vagus nerve",

The symptomatology of the condition appears to emanate from a variety of sources of chronic neurological disturbance and associated distortions, and chronicity, in noxious sensory signaling and neuroimmune activation. This article incorporates a summary review and discussion of biomedical research considered relevant to this essential conception perspective. It is intended to provide stakeholders with a concise, integrated outline disease model in order to help demystify this major public health problem. The primary etiopathological factors presented are: (A) Postural/biomechanical pain signaling, affecting adverse neuroexcitation, in the context of compression, constriction, strain, or damage of vertebral-regional bone and neuromuscular tissues; (B) Immune mediated inflammatory sequelae, in the context of prolonged immunotropic neurotrophic infection-with lymphotropic/gliotropic/glio-toxic varieties implicated in particular; (C) A combination of factors A and B. Sustained glial activation under such conditions is associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation, and neural sensitivity. These processes collectively enhance the potential for multi-systemic disarray involving endocrine pathway aberration, immune and mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, and tend toward still more intractable synergistic neuro-glial dysfunction (gliopathy), autoimmunity, and central neuronal sensitization.",

While the importance of early detection is recognised, MCI is frequently underdiagnosed, especially when patients consult primary care physicians for non-cognitive health concerns. The case series aims to investigate the incidental identification of MCI in older patients who visit primary care settings for reasons unrelated to memory issues.",

      "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of unrecognized brain dysfunction accompanying chronic severe cardiac disease, we examined 20 clinically stable consecutive admissions to a cardiac rehabilitation service who were free of known stroke or dementia. Age range was 47 to 85 years (mean +/- SEM, 72.5 +/- 2.1 years), the male: female ratio was 10:10. Multiple cognitive deficits including significant memory impairment and disorientation were present in eight patients (40%), and seven of these eight patients were unable to administer their own medications reliably. An additional six patients (30%) showed milder impairments. One patient was found to be normal after neurological examination, four showed evidence of a single brain lesion, and 15 of 20 (75%) had multiple neurological abnormalities suggesting multifocal brain disease. The mechanism of cognitive deficits in cardiac patients is unclear, and it may be related to multiple infarcts, or acute or chronic hypoxic damage secondary to arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or small vessel disease of the brain. The term \"circulatory dementia\" is proposed to describe patients with vascular disease and non-Alzheimer type dementia. Patients with cardiac disease should undergo cognitive screening, as early identification of patients at risk of progressive intellectual loss may allow early use of preventive therapy.",

      "abstract": "Neurological syndromes attributed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include encephalitis, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathy. More recently, polyradiculopathy due to CMV has been described. We review the literature and describe two patients with CMV polyradiculopathy whose conditions improved only after prolonged therapy with ganciclovir. Patients typically are young men who are severely immunocompromised and have had other opportunistic infections. The syndrome is characterized by subacute onset of leg weakness and numbness progressing to paraparesis or paraplegia. Bladder dysfunction is common. In many patients, CMV may be identified elsewhere; concomitant retinitis is common and often subclinical. Laboratory studies commonly show an increased number of neutrophils in CSF and hypoglycorrhachia. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies support the diagnosis. Imaging studies may be most useful to exclude spinal lesions. Without treatment prognosis is poor. Survival time is improved and symptoms often abate, sometimes dramatically, with ganciclovir therapy. Improvement of conditions may be rapid but can take months, as illustrated by these two cases. Once initiated, ganciclovir should be administered indefinitely to patients with CMV polyradiculopathy.",

There are generalized (e.g., absence status) and focal (e.g., aphasic status, complex partial status) forms. Some patients are responsive but have cognitive or other neurologic deficits; others are less responsive or even comatose. Increasingly, the diagnosis of NCSE is considered in intensive care unit patients. Here, without clinical signs of seizures such as convulsions, EEG is critical in diagnosis, but there is uncertainty about which EEG patterns represent seizures and which clinical situations and EEG patterns warrant aggressive treatment. Antiseizure medications are tailored to the NCSE type and the clinical condition. Treatment is often easier for NCSE, and the outcome better, than for convulsive SE, but this is not always true for critically ill patients with NCSE in the ICU, for whom continuous EEG monitoring is often crucial for diagnosis and management.",

In most cases, prognosis for complete recovery is good. The incidence of inherited and autoimmune neuromuscular diseases in women of childbearing age is relatively rare, and our knowledge of their impact in pregnancy is limited.

      "abstract": "Les maladies auto-immunes peuvent avoir une expression psychiatrique. Les troubles psychiatriques presentes par les patients peuvent etre severes. Il peut s’agir par exemple d’un delire, d’hallucinations, d’un episode maniaque, d’un trouble depressif resistant ou recurrent. Ces troubles psychiatriques sont parfois inauguraux ou au premier plan, ce qui peut conduire a des erreurs diagnostiques et therapeutiques prejudiciables pour le patient. Les symptomes psychiatriques evocateurs d’une organicite sont souvent atypiques. Il s’agit d’hallucinations visuelles pregnantes, d’une fluctuation des symptomes psychiatriques, d’une resistance au traitement antipsychotique usuel, d’une catatonie associee. Par ailleurs, l’association de ces troubles a des signes de regression cognitive, touchant souvent la memoire et le langage, doit alerter le clinicien. Le risque vital et le risque de sequelles cognitives constituent un enjeu de taille pour la vie du patient. L’objectif de cette these est de mener une reflexion sur l’enjeu diagnostic et therapeutique dans ces maladies auto-immunes a expression psychiatrique, chez l’enfant et l’adolescent, d’abord par une revue exhaustive de la litterature sur le neurolupus, l’encephalite anti-NMDA, l’encephalite de Hashimoto, ensuite par un approfondissement de la catatonie en tant que syndrome d’une importance majeure dans le raisonnement diagnostique et therapeutique de part son lien fort entre psychiatrie et organicite. Deux cas cliniques pediatriques illustratifs sont rapportes. Un algorithme decisionnel sur demarche diagnostique et therapeutique de l’encephalite auto-immune est propose. Les examens paracliniques doivent etre larges et repetes, parfois invasifs (ponction lombaire). Cependant, l’identification des anticorps specifiques de la maladie n’etant pas toujours possible, elle ne devrait pas constituer un critere diagnostic exclusif. L’enjeu diagnostic est donc de recolter un faisceau d’arguments cliniques et paracliniques forts en faveur du diagnostic d’encephalite auto-immune. Un traitement d’epreuve, par exemple par corticoides, pourrait representer un argument interessant dans certains cas. Dans 30 a 40% des cas, les symptomes sont resistants au traitement de premiere ligne par corticotherapie. Des traitements immunosuppresseurs plus agressifs ont demontre un benefice dans ces situations, malgre les risques lies a leur eventuelle toxicite. La precocite du traitement immunologique et son efficacite conditionnent le pronostic cognitif.",

By definition, it has no obvious clinical manifestation and is characterized by neurocognitive impairment in attention, vigilance and integrative function. Although often not considered to be clinically relevant and, therefore, not diagnosed or treated, MHE has been shown to affect daily functioning, quality of life, driving and overall mortality. The diagnosis of MHE has traditionally been achieved through neuropsychological examination, psychometric tests or the newer critical flicker frequency test. A new smartphone application (EncephalApp Stroop Test) may serve to function as a screening tool for patients requiring further testing. In addition to physician reporting and driving restrictions, medical treatment for MHE includes non-absorbable disaccharides (eg, lactulose), probiotics or rifaximin. Liver transplantation may not result in reversal of the cognitive deficits associated with MHE.",

There are no accepted diagnostic or classification criteria, but most agree that the manifestations can be described as representing diffuse CNS insult or a more focal or localized process. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it is likely that there is more than one mechanism given the heterogeneous clinical presentations. It is probable that autoantibody formation, vascular injury, and cytokine production all play a role. There are no randomized controlled trials to help guide therapeutic decision making, but there is data to suggest that treatment of severe NPSLE with IV cyclophosphamide may be of benefit. Additionally, there may be a role for IVGG or synchronized plasmapheresis in cases that fail to respond to IV-CYC. An important role for sex steroids in the etiology of NPSLE is suggested by various observations. Investigational therapy with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) appeared to have benefits with respect to milder symptoms of NPSLE.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are an relevant problem of modern neurology and psychiatry, which is explained by their wide prevalence, as well as the predicted increase in the number of patients in the future. However, dementia in most cases does not occur acutely, its development is preceded by a long period when cognitive impairments do not disrupt the patient’s everyday and professional life yet. Such cognitive impairments are called “pre-dementia” and are divided into subjective, subtle, and mild. With subjective cognitive impairment, patients present complaints; however, neuropsychological testing does not reveal decreased cognitive functions. Subtle cognitive impairment is accompanied by a decrease in cognitive functions when using highly sensitive scales. This article provides an overview of current data on the definition, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the point of view of the evidence-based medicine for timely diagnostics of the state and its effective correction. In patients with MCI, in addition to complaints of cognitive deficit, it is detected during screening neuropsychological testing; but unlike dementia, it does not impair the patient’s functionality. MCI is a leading risk factor for future dementia. However, according to research, cognitive deficits can not only progress, but also stabilize and even regress. In this regard, it is important to identify patients with MCI on time, establish nosological affiliation for correcting risk factors and prescribing treatment. The most common causes of MCI can be neurodegenerative disorders (primarily Alzheimer’s disease) and cerebrovascular diseases. The authors present the diagnostic value of popular scales such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale and the 3-CT test in the diagnosis of MCI. The possibilities of using biomarkers, such as the determination of beta-amyloid and tau-protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the detection of signs of neuronal damage during neuroimaging of the brain, are discussed. It is stated that the most proven methods of influencing cognitive deficits in MCI are non-drug measures.",

HaNDL is a self-limiting condition, but the grave symptoms require a large-scale differential diagnosis. We report a case of a 24-year-old female who developed dysarthria for several hours and decreased use of the right arm with right-sided facial weakness. After extensive investigation of blood, CSF, and neuroimaging, we excluded central nervous system infections and autoimmune and vascular diseases. A diagnosis of HaNDL was made according to clinical symptoms and CSF analysis. The prognosis was good, and the symptoms resolved. Repeated physical examination after 48 h was unremarkable. HaNDL is probably not as rare as commonly thought; awareness of its existence can avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful investigations and therapies. The clinical challenge relies on the fact that it remains a diagnosis of exclusion.",

Stroke due to cerebral vasculitis is a rare consequence of neuroborreliosis and has been described in just a few case reports. Case Presentation. Here, we report the case of a 43-year-old patient who presented with discrete left-sided hemiparesis and amnestic cognitive impairment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a thalamic infarct, and serological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests confirmed the diagnosis of active neuroborreliosis. The antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone for three weeks led to an improvement of the symptoms and remarkable regression of radiological findings, but not to full recovery of the amnestic cognitive disorder. Conclusion. Lyme neuroborreliosis should be suspected in patients with cerebrovascular events without obvious risk factors, especially those living in endemic areas such as northern Europe or those who have been exposed to ticks and those with clinical or radiological findings suggesting Lyme neuroborreliosis, in order to establish the diagnosis and start a proper antibiotic therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The range and breadth of diseases of the nervous system caused by immunological, infective, or inflammatory disturbances is very large. It includes ‘primary’ or idiopathic neuroimmune disor- ders, which may affect any part of the neuraxis (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syn- drome), and which are very familiar to neurologists. ‘Secondary’ disorders, where the neurological disturbance reflects involvement of the nervous system in a systemic inflammatory disease, are no less common than idiopathic immune disorders, but most neurologists are rather less familiar and comfortable with them. In this account we can necessarily provide only a brief overview; and our aim is not to be encyclopaedically inclusive, but to rather to follow William Morris’s advice, and aim to ‘have nothing in … that [we] do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful’; we therefore offer a summary of those diseases which are either reasonably common, or which illustrate principles of particular interest and relevance. Prion-related disor- ders are covered elsewhere; Chapters 16 and 18. Where possible, we will point out particular fea- tures which might direct the physician (or psychiatrist) towards specific diseases, and approaches to diagnosis. The management of these rare and often life-threatening disorders is beyond the scope of this chapter (see Scolding 1999).",

      "abstract": "Focal weakness of the limbs can be organized by affected body region. Shoulder weakness is most commonly due to C5–6 radiculopathy or brachial plexopathy. Scapular winging is usually secondary to long thoracic or accessory neuropathy. Hand weakness is most commonly the result of ulnar neuropathy, C8–T1 radiculopathy, motor neuron disease, or cerebral processes. Wrist drop is a special kind of hand weakness. The two most common sources of wrist drop are radial neuropathy and stroke, and can be differentiated from each other with focused examination. Proximal leg weakness is usually the result of upper lumbar radiculopathy or lumbar plexopathy. Postpartum leg weakness has multiple potential causes that can be distinguished by careful examination. Foot drop may be due to lesions of the peroneal nerve, sciatic nerve, L5 nerve root, or central nervous system. Multifocal weakness is due to multifocal central or peripheral nervous system disease. Relevant peripheral nervous system causes of multifocal weakness include mononeuropathy multiplex, multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.",

      "title": "RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP QUALITY, BODY PERCEPTION AND MOTOR AND SENSORY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

Clinically, these diseases typically involve visual failure, medically refractory epilepsy, and relentless declines in motor and cognitive skills, usually ending in premature death. Collectively, the NCLs are considered the most common inherited neurodegenerative disease of child hood, but accurate incidence and prevalence rates are hard to obtain. Large animal models are especially valuable since their complex brains more closely resemble the human system and overcome the limitations of the relatively simple nervous system of mice. Significant spinal cord pathology is also evident, and the peripheral, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems are also affected. At present, no curative or disease-modifying treatment is available for the majority of NCL patients, and clinical care is limited to symptom control and supportive approaches.",

Once even mild clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dementia supervened, at least three of the four were present. Conversely, I have yet to observe a patient with none of this tetrad experience a cognitive problem of recent onset on an organic basis; these patients usually have a psychiatrically related disorder of mood or thought.

Maengel der gesundheitlichen Konstitution koennen die Gefahr solcher Fehlreaktionen erhoehen, die Betroffenen koennen dies aber durch erhoehte Vorsicht und so weiter ausgleichen, sodass zur medizinischen Verkehrstauglichkeitsbeurteilung neben fachaerztlicher Befunderhebung auch die Verwendung von kraftfahrspezifischen Leistungstests zu fordern ist, vor allem aber auch die Compliance der Lenker beurteilt werden muss. Dies gilt fuer internistisch kranke Lenker in gleicher Weise wie fuer neurologisch psychiatrische Patienten. Auf die durch zunehmende Ueberalterung der Bevoelkerung resultierenden Probleme wird verwiesen.

Celem pracy jest przedstawienie przypadku pacjenta z postawionym rozpoznaniem choroby Whipple'a z dominującymi w fazie późnej powikłaniami neuropsychologicznymi i behawioralnymi. Metoda. Opis przypadku - Pacjent 54l. przyjęty do Kliniki Neurologii SCPSK celem diagnostyki pogarszającego się od ok. 1,5 roku stanu ogólnego z wyniszczeniem oraz stopniowo narastających objawów neurologicznych. Wyniki. Prezentowany przypadek dowodzi, że wielospecjalistyczna opieka kliniczna pozwala na uchwycenie zaburzeń neurobehawioralnych już na wczesnym etapie zajęcia OUN. Nawet prawidłowo zastosowana antybiotykoterapia nie stanowi zapewnienia pełnej remisji choroby i uniknięcia tym samym powikłań ze strony OUN. Wnioski. Choroba Whipple'a jest rzadką chorobą z możliwymi powikłaniami neurologicznymi i neuropsychiatrycznymi. Zaburzenia neurologiczne (miorytmie oczno-twarzowe i szkieletowe, mioklonie, postępujące otępienie, zaburzenia gałkoruchowe) mogą wystąpić w przebiegu tej choroby nawet pomimo prawidłowo prowadzonej terapii farmakologicznej. Poza klasycznym zespołem neurologicznym przewlekłej postaci lipodystrofii jelitowej w obrazie klinicznym mogą wystąpić również niespecyficzne zaburzenia funkcji poznawczych, a także zaburzenia ze strony układu autonomicznego. Prawidłowo zastosowana antybiotykoterapia nie zawsze zapewnia pełną remisję choroby i zapobiega wystąpieniu powikłań neuropsychiatrycznych, jednak wczesna diagnoza oraz czujność kliniczna umożliwiają włączenie właściwego leczenia i poprawiają dalsze rokowanie.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric diseases are clearly different from other physical diseases in that the pathophysiology of the diseases is still unknown. Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

      "abstract": "There is reason to presume the existence of an epileptological disease entity called 'common generalized epilepsy' (CGE) with generalized-synchronous seizure discharges and strictly nonfocal seizures (petit mal, grand mal, myoclonus) occurring chiefly in the age range from 4 to 16 years. There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The physiopathogenesis of CGE and its generalized seizure patterns is discussed.",

The current hospital model can be a restrictive, unfamiliar, and threatening environment, particularly for a patient with mild dementia, poor mobility, decreased hearing, or visual disturbances. Delirium requires the presence of acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention and disorganized thinking, or altered level of consciousness. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been known to reduce the risk of recurrent disabling stroke or death in patients with severe ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis.

      "abstract": "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, among the paraneoplastic syndromes, is a recently characterized autoimmune encephalitis most commonly associated with antibodies against subunits of the NMDAR in the central nervous system. As a paraneoplastic syndrome, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is commonly associated with ovarian teratomas, small cell lung carcinomas and testicular germ cell tumors. To our knowledge, there have been no cases with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare type of extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, without lymph node involvement associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.A 58-year-old right-handed male patient with complaints of instability in walking for two months, progressively smaller handwriting, hallucinations when falling asleep or waking up, decreased memory, inability to maintain attention was admitted to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. Lumbar puncture was performed with the diagnosis of possible encephalitis after many further examinations and CSF studies revealed NMDAR antibody positivity, leading to the initial diagnosis of anti - NMDAR encephalitis. He was treated with high dose methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin. Due to the continuation of the patient's presenting symptoms and cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings, a stereotactic brain biopsy was performed from the area with contrast enhancement and the diagnosis was revised as PCNSL associated with NMDAR antibody positivity.This report emphasizes the importance of anti-NMDAR encephalitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome in previously undiagnosed PCNSL. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of anti-NMDAR encephalitis as a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome that can present with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is necessary to continually observe the evolution of the disease and perform further diagnostic tests for early identification.",

It can be differentiated from other disorders causing daytime drowsiness by its clinical symptoms and by sleep laboratory studies. The disorder usually begins in adolescence and remains present throughout life. Genetic susceptibility to narcolepsy is closely associated with specific HLAs that indicate the existence of a gene in the region of the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6 that increases susceptibility to narcolepsy. Neurochemical studies of human and canine narcolepsy have demonstrated disturbed monoaminergic and cholinergic function that may account for impaired regulation of rapid eye movement sleep, but the link between these abnormalities and the genetic factors is still unknown. Treatment of sleepiness with stimulants and cataplexy with tricyclic antidepressants leads to substantial improvement but does not fully resolve symptoms in most patients.",

There is also evidence to suggest that cerebral dysfunction, particularly impaired abstracting ability, occurs in that larger population of heavy drinkers who do not go on to develop the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. There is no consistent evidence that long-term marijuana, hallucinogen, or sedative use causes lasting neuropsychological disturbance. The deficits in abstract thinking reported by some LSD studies are similar to deficits others have reported among alcoholics. Since the LSD studies were not controlled for alcohol use, their interpretation is difficult. It appears that cerebrovascular accidents occur more frequently and at a younger age among amphetamine abusers. There is no reliable information about possible other long-term effects of stimulants on the brain per se (i.e., nonvascular complications). Abuse of intravenous narcotics has been associated with case reports of transverse myelitis and encephalitis.

Psychiatric comorbidity is common in MS. However, the incidence of psychiatric comorbidity remains understudied. Objectives To discuss the relationship of psychiatric disorder to neurologic dysfunction in MS through a clinical case. Methods Presentation of a clinical case of bipolar disorder in a 45-year-old woman with MS, followed by a literature review. Results We reported a case of a 45-year-old woman, who was followed in neurology for MS since the age of twenty-five. She was stable under monthly treatment. She was referred by her neurologist for psychomotor excitement, insomnia, feeling of well being, and sexual disinhibition. The symptoms were present for three weeks. At the interview, she was euphoric, disinhibited, she had logorrhea and did not verbalize delirium. An attack of multiple sclerosis was ruled out. The patient did not report any history of psychiatric illness, epilepsy, head trauma, or use of psychoactive substances. We retained the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (manic episode). Divalproex sodium and olanzapine were prescribed with significant improvement of symptoms. Conclusions This reported case is interesting since it highlights the possible association between multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder. Further investigations are needed to identify potential shared risk factors between these pathologies to improve patients’ outcomes.",

These syndromes include the CNS complications of systemic autoimmune disorders: IgG4-related disease, Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and sarcoidosis. In each of them, neurological symptoms may precede the onset of systemic symptoms. Other ‘frontier disorders’ include several diseases associated with primary involvement of the vascular endothelium or blood vessels: cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation, Susac’s syndrome, and primary angiitis of the CNS, which can all present with isolated neurological manifestations. These syndromes are immune-mediated, do not present specific or pathogenic neuronal antibodies, and their diagnosis is based on well-established clinical criteria that sometimes include neuroimaging and histopathological features. The clinical presentation of these syndromes may mimic that of several autoimmune encephalitis: SLE can present with psychosis (thus, it may need the differential diagnosis with anti-NMDAR encephalitis); IgG4-related disease can present with meningoencephalitis; and Behçet disease can present with brainstem dysfunction and neuroimaging findings resembling those of chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS). The clinical presentation of primary angiitis of the CNS and Susac syndrome can be indistinguishable from that of autoimmune encephalitis.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), central nervous system (CNS) infections and brain tumours combined all account for roughly one-fifth of the aetiologies of newly-diagnosed epilepsies. The risk of epilepsy associated with each of these conditions is variable and depends on a number of factors. For both TBI and stroke, the most important determinants are location and severity of the injury or stroke. Among various CNS infections, episodes of viral encephalitis are associated with the highest risk of epilepsy and among various brain tumours, the low grade glial neoplasms, including developmental tumours such as dysembroplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNETs) and gangliogliomas are most frequently associated with chronic epilepsy. One important consideration in the treatment of epilepsy associated with each of these conditions is the range of drug interactions between AEDs and drugs used to treat either the primary condition (e.g. tumour with cancer chemotherapeutic agents) or its associated comorbidities (e.g. in CVD). The newer AEDs (e.g. levetiracetam) offer the promise of being devoid of any known drug interactions and experience appears to be accumulating regarding their use in various situations associated with each condition. It is clear that primary prevention of seizures with the first-line AEDs has practically no role in the management these conditions (including TBI, stroke, infections, and tumours). The prognosis of epilepsy associated with stroke is generally good and that following TBI and CNS infections is variable. There is a high chance of developing medically-refractory epilepsy with low-grade glial brain tumours. Surgery has a role in the management of medically-refractory epilepsy associated with TBI and CNS infections but there are caveats to a wider application. In low grade glial neoplasms, surgical treatment is of critical importance in ensuring seizure remission.",

Among the neurological sequelae of NC, seizures have been described as the most common symptom. Acute symptomatic seizures often result from degeneration of a viable cyst; however, not all of these patients with acute or provoked seizures will develop epilepsy (i.e., recurrent unprovoked seizures). Because of the high prevalence of epilepsy and NC, a causal, as well as incidental relationship between the two may exist. The epileptogenicity of calcified cysts as well as the potential association between NC and hippocampal sclerosis necessitates future research. Antihelminthic treatment of NC results in disappearance of viable cysts in about one-third of patients with parenchymal disease, but a reduction in seizure recurrence has not been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. Prevention is critical to reduce the burden of seizure and epilepsy related to NC.",

The major cause of CVI is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in premature children. CVI occurs from the postgeniculate visual pathway to the occipital lobe and results in severe visual impairment and even blindness. CVI may also lead to visual cognitive disability, walk difficulty, delayed social interaction and autism spectrum. These children are less likely to live independently, and this will impose huge costs on families and society. Therefore, much more care and attention should be paid to CVI.

Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

The neurological manifestations of SLE consist of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system manifestations (PNS). The CNS manifestations are aseptic meningitis, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), demyelinating disorders, headache, involuntary movements like chorea, myelopathy, acute confusional states, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorder, seizures, psychosis and cranial nerve palsies.1 The PNS manifestations are Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), autonomic disorder, mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy and plexopathy.1 Neuropathy in SLE can be clinically classified as mononeuritis multiplex and symmetrical and asymmetrical polyneuropathy. Symmetrical polyneuropathy being the most commonly seen clinical entity amongst the neuropathies in SLE. The neuropathy can be slowly progressive or acute in onset. Electrophysiologically, neuropathy is classified as axonal neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, mixed axonal-demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and plexopathy. Axonal neuropathy is further divided into sensory, sensorimotor and mononeuritis multiplex. Demyelinating neuropathy can be of two types: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anecdotal case reports also suggest that CIDP can occur as part of SLE neuropathy.2.",

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

      "abstract": "There is little information on the psychologic aspects of HED. In particular, there is insufficient evidence to support or dispute the claim that the intelligence of persons with HED is dissimilar to that of the general population. Impressions of frequent mental retardation may arise from patients suffering brain damage following high fever and from our biases against the physically unattractive. A small number of adults with HED have been reported to hold a relatively wide range of jobs, and an even smaller number have been reported with educational and occupational achievement that is predictive of bright average to superior intellectual functioning, but even less evidence is available here. Chronic illness and handicaps exert a toll on the patient and the family. There appears to be greater maladjustment among the families of chronically ill children, but this differs according to the type of illness, and we do not know how this affects the HED child and his/her family. Still, the HED family is exposed to some unique stresses: having always to take into account the ambient temperature regardless of their planned activity; responding to cruel stares and remarks when out in public; and dealing with the problem of broken, lost, or merely publicly discovered dentures. On the other hand, some children apparently benefit from having a sib with a disability. Families react in a variety of ways to a disability, and their reaction may interact with the child's temperament to affect emotional development for better or worse. However, the existence of HED does not insure either normal or inadequate emotional adjustment, and parents should be advised of this. As difficult as it may be, this may also be the time for the pediatrician to say \"I don't know.\" Parents can be told that each child, not just those with HED, should be provided a warm and supportive environment congruent with his/her unique style, in order to facilitate emotional development. They should also be advised of the probable emotional benefits of early prosthetic care with wigs and dentures. When this is either not possible or not sufficient, professional guidance should be sought. Psychotherapy or counseling can be obtained for the child, a parent, or for the entire family. While some familiarity with HED may be helpful, it is not essential, and is far less important than finding a competent professional with whom the family is comfortable. As far as obtaining the information we need, a series of systematic investigations appears to be called for.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The patients showed mild intellectual impairment but had worked diligently for many years without their impairment being noticed by others. Some displayed maladjustments in their childhood and were classified as having intellectual disabilities. With their low self-esteem, precipitating events forced the patients to act inappropriately and, as a result, they became psychotic. Although APPD is supposed to occur without causative stress, an intellectual limitation combined with a certain personality can precipitate such a psychosis. It is noted that APPD might mask intellectual deficit and their precipitating factors and that a relapse could be prevented by advising a member of the patient's family.",

Recent findings Headache, dizziness, excessive tiredness, myalgia, anosmia/hyposmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia are common nonspecific neurological manifestations during early COVID-19 disease found in the majority of patients. Less frequent but more severe and specific neurological manifestations include Guillain--Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis/meningitis, epileptic seizures, and cerebrovascular events. Beyond standard neurological examination, these require a more extensive work-up, including cerebrospinal fluid assessment, neurophysiological evaluation, neuroimaging, and cognitive testing. Symptomatic treatment is advisable unless the neurological complication's immune pathogenesis is proven. Summary Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 occur during the acute, para-infectious, and ‘recovery’ phase. Therapeutic management depends on the clinical presentation and neurological work-up.",

      "abstract": "The effects of stroke on classically nondominant hemisphere functions have received less attention than those on the dominant hemisphere, but visuospatial neglect and denial of illness both produce significant morbidity. The early literature on denial of illness is discussed and the etiological theories are examined. These are explanations based on deficits of higher mental function, impaired sensory input (especially proprioceptive), an abnormal representation of body image, psychodynamic defense mechanisms, and/or premorbid personality factors. Denial of illness is an important consequence of stroke. No explanation thus far proposed is entirely satisfactory. The consequences on rehabilitation and strategies for therapy have not been adequately investigated.",

      "abstract": "La demencia es un sindrome que se caracteriza por la perdida de la funcion cognitiva; afecta a la memoria, el pensamiento, la orientacion, la comprension, el calculo, la capacidad de aprendizaje, el lenguaje y el juicio. Los efectos del deterioro de estas funciones traen como consecuencia la perdida de la capacidad para cuidar de uno mismo y de programar y llevar a cabo las actividades de forma progresiva. La demencia Alzheimer es la mas comun y sobre la que mas estudios se han realizado, pero tambien hay otros tipos como la demencia vascular, demencia frontotemporal y la demencia de cuerpos de Lewy. En el mundo hay unos 47,5 millones de personas con demencia y cada ano se registran 7,7 millones de nuevos casos. Existe evidencia que demuestra el problema de desnutricion que padecen muchas de las personas con demencia. Sus problemas de alimentacion son derivados del deterioro de las habilidades motoras y cognitivas antes mencionadas: se les olvida comer, no reconocen los alimentos, sufren disfagia... Una de las opciones para hacer frente a la desnutricion en estos pacientes consiste en iniciar una alimentacion enteral por sonda nasograstrica (SN) o gastrostomia endoscopica percutanea (PEG), especialmente en casos graves; pero su utilizacion es controvertida y presenta muchas cuestiones eticas. Cuando la alimentacion por sonda esta contraindicada o es inapropiada se deben encontrar estrategias para fomentar la ingesta de alimentos. Se han sugerido muchos consejos para las etapas tempranas de la demencia pero la evidencia en la que se basan no esta clara. (2)",

      "title": "Συνύπαρξη υπερτροφικής μυοκαρδιοπάθειας και κατάθλιψης",
      "abstract": "Μια από τις συχνότερες αιτίες αιφνίδιου θανάτου είναι η υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια, η οποία ορίζεται ως ανεξήγητη υπερτροφία της αριστερής ή/ και της δεξιάς κοιλίας της καρδιάς. (WHO / ISFC) Πρόκειται για τη συχνότερη αιτία νεανικού αιφνίδιου θανάτου. Επιπροσθέτως, από τις πιο συχνές ψυχιατρικές διαταραχές της εποχής μας είναι οι διαταραχές της διάθεσης, και μάλιστα οι καταθλιπτικές διαταραχές. Υπάρχουν πολλοί παράγοντες που αλληλεπιδρούν έτσι ώστε να εκδηλώσει το άτομο καταθλιπτική συμπτωματολογία. Βιολογικές, νευροενδοκρινικές, νευροανατομικές, νευροανοσολογικές, μεταβολικές και γενετικές συνιστώσες συνθέτουν την πολύπλοκη νόσο που καλείται κατάθλιψη. Διάφοροι παράγοντες, όπως τα ψυχοπιεστικά γεγονότα ζωής, έχουν τη δύναμη να πυροδοτήσουν και να εξάρουν την καταθλιπτική συμπτωματολογία. Μια συμπτωματολογία που αφορά τόσο στην ψυχική όσο και τη σωματική διάσταση του ατόμου. Αρκετά συχνά, το άτομο με καταθλιπτική νόσο πάσχει και από κάποιο οργανικό νόσημα. Οι δυο αυτές διαφορετικές νοσολογικές οντότητες μπορεί να εμφανιστούν συγχρόνως ή η μια να προηγείται της άλλης. Τα νοσήματα του καρδιαγγειακού συστήματος αποτελούν την κατηγορία εκείνη των νοσημάτων που είναι από τα καλύτερα μελετημένα όσων αφορά στην συνύπαρξή τους με κατάθλιψη. Πλήθος ερευνών έχει δείξει τη σαφή τους συσχέτιση καθώς και το πώς η ψυχική νόσος επηρεάζει την πορεία και την πρόγνωση του καρδιοπαθούς. Στον τομέα όμως των κληρονομικών καρδιαγγειακών νοσημάτων, οι μόνες έρευνες που έχουν γίνει περιορίζονται στην μελέτη της ποιότητας ζωής των ατόμων με διατατική και υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια. Σκοπός της παρούσας έρευνας είναι να διερευνηθεί το ενδεχόμενο ύπαρξης σχέσης μεταξύ κατάθλιψης και ενός συγκεκριμένου τύπου καρδιοπάθειας, της υπερτροφικής μυοκαρδιοπάθειας. Θεωρώντας δεδομένη την ύπαρξη υπερτροφικής μυοκαρδιοπάθειας θέλαμε να διερευνήσουμε αν αυτή συνεπάγεται μεγαλύτερη επίπτωση καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας στους ασθενείς. Επιπροσθέτως, δευτερευόντως, θέλαμε να αξιολογήσουμε την επίδραση της καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας στην κλινική εικόνα, την εμφάνιση επιπλοκών και τη θνησιμότητα ασθενών πασχόντων από υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια. Τον υπό μελέτη πληθυσμό αποτέλεσαν 121 ασθενείς πάσχοντες από υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια. Η καρδιακή νόσος καθώς και η διαστρωμάτωση του κινδύνου για αιφνίδιο θάνατο διαγνώσθηκαν από καρδιολόγους ειδικούς στις κληρονομικές καρδιαγγειακές παθήσεις (Ελληνικό Κέντρο Καρδιολογίας Αθλητών και Νέων, ΕΚΚΑΝ). Για την εκτίμηση της καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας χρησιμοποιήθηκαν οι κλίμακες BDI, CES-D και η δομημένη κλινική συνέντευξη για την κατάθλιψη (SCID for DSM III - IIIR). Διαπιστώσαμε ότι οι ασθενείς με υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια είναι περισσότερο καταθλιπτικοί από το γενικό πληθυσμό. Η καταθλιπτική συμπτωματολογία δε φαίνεται να συνδέεται με τη σοβαρότητα της καρδιακής νόσου και οι ασθενείς που θεωρούνται υψηλού κινδύνου για αιφνίδιο θάνατο δεν είναι πιο καταθλιπτικοί από τους υπόλοιπους. Φαίνεται επίσης πως η διαστρωμάτωση του κινδύνου για αιφνίδιο θάνατο δεν επηρεάζει ούτε την παρούσα αλλά ούτε και την μελλοντική ψυχική κατάσταση του ατόμου. Επιπροσθέτως, ο χρόνος που έχει περάσει από την αρχική διάγνωση της καρδιακής νόσου δε σχετίζεται με τη συναισθηματική κατάσταση του ατόμου. Λόγω του μεγέθους του δείγματος και του περιορισμένου χρόνου παρακολούθησης δε μπορούμε να πιθανολογήσουμε συσχέτιση μεταξύ της ύπαρξης καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας και της επίδρασής της στη θνησιμότητα του καρδιοπαθούς. Συμπερασματικά, από την παρούσα έρευνα φαίνεται πως οι ασθενείς με υπερτροφική μυοκαρδιοπάθεια είναι περισσότερο καταθλιπτικοί από το γενικό πληθυσμό. Η εμφάνιση καταθλιπτικής συμπτωματολογίας φαίνεται να είναι ανεξάρτητη από τη διαστρωμάτωση του κινδύνου για αιφνίδιο θάνατο αλλά και από το χρόνο που έχει περάσει από τη διάγνωση της καρδιακής νόσου.",

Outcome can be quantified by means of specific, narrowly-defined measures, which may fail to reflect other serious sequelae, or by means of functional rating scales, which bear little logical relation to CHI pathophysiology and lump together patients with diverse deficits. The choice of appropriate intake measures of CHI severity in turn depends on which aspects of outcome are to be determined. As the cardinal symptom of CHI is altered consciousness, logical intake measures of CHI severity include measures of the depth and the duration of the abnormal state of consciousness. Confounding factors in outcome prediction include secondary complications of CHI, premorbid characteristics, and effects of acute and rehabilitative therapy. Most research has focused on functional outcome predictions based on simple intake measures obtained shortly after injury, but intake measures that permit accurate prediction of rehabilitation potential or of specific cognitive and behavioral outcomes are also needed.",

Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Distinct from Chapter 24, on co-occurring psychiatric disorders, this chapter addresses common physical comorbidities that give rise to chronic pain and are notorious for associated substance use disorders. The concept of “pseudo-addiction” is explored as one of several contributors to common misperceptions of the analgesic needs of such patients. Examples of entities discussed are chronic low back pain, sleep apnea, chronic pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and HIV infection or AIDS-related pain. While not intrinsically painful, sleep apnea merits inclusion as it arises in conjunction with sedative-hypnotic, opioid, or nicotine use. Cirrhosis likewise creates obstacles to successful pain or addiction management resulting from altered metabolism of medications and enhanced susceptibility to potentially lethal syndromes (hepato-renal syndrome, gastric hemorrhage, etc.). The management of neuropathic pain in HIV infection (Chapter 15) is amplified here.",

      "title": "Complex visual hallucinations. Clinical and neurobiological insights",
      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

The patient was a 74‐year‐old‐woman who had complications of chronic renal failure and renal anemia for several years. Seven months before her death she had symptoms of general fatigue, gait disturbance and articulation disorder. During her hospitalization period her neurological disorder gradually progressed irreversibly with failure of consciousness and she died of respiratory failure. She did not have remarkable clinical signs of immunodeficiency nor did she receive immunosuppressive therapy. Clinically she had not been diagnosed with PML. At the post‐mortem examination different degrees of demyelination were observed in the brain white matter: diffuse and severe in the cerebellum, moderate and coalescent in the brainstem, and light and patchy in the cerebrum. JC virus antigen‐positive cells were frequently observed in the demyelinated lesions in the cerebrum and sometimes observed in the brainstem, but were rarely found in the cerebellum. These findings suggest that PML lesions may be present with different degrees of demyelination that are inversely correlated with the number of JC virus‐infected cells. This fact should be considered when evaluating the brain biopsies of PML patients.",

Its etiology remains unclear, and in most cases, the diagnosis is made heuristically, based on the similarity of clinical manifestations in a particular patient with the “classical” descriptions available in the literature. The article presents two clinical cases of Hirst’s encephalitis. In the first case, the disease debuted at the age of 14 with mental disorders, manifested by panencephalitis, depression of consciousness, and epileptic seizures. Against the background of aggressive therapy, it was possible to achieve a positive result, however, with an outcome in gross neurological and cognitive deficits. In the second case, the disease debuted at the age of 49 with loss of consciousness, manifested itself as resistant status epilepticus and multifocal inflammatory lesions of the white matter of both brain hemispheres with foci of hemorrhagic impregnation. Despite intensive therapy, this case was fatal. In conclusion, a description of the approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of Hirst’s encephalitis based on the data of modern literature is presented.",

Outcome was more benign than in schizophrenia, with most patients having a brief duration of psychosis and good response to small doses of neuroleptics. One-fourth of patients suffered a single, brief psychotic episode with return to full premorbid function. None required maintenance neuroleptic treatment. The outcome and descriptive profile of the disorder also differed from late-onset schizophrenia. Thus, Psychosis due to a General Medical (Neurological) Condition does appear to have predictive validity. However, no temporal association was found between the neurological illness and psychosis. Possible reasons for this are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Autoimune dementias are underrecognized clinical entities, frequently misdiagnosed as neurodegenerative or prion disorders. However, the prognosis is vastly different since immunotherapy can treat these conditions and restore functionality. Research objective: To reflect on autoimmune dementias, briefly presenting the autoimmune syndromes, how to diagnose them and some clinical cues to be attentive of. Methods: Literature search on Pubmed and Google Scholar. Results: The incidence and prevalence of autoimmune dementias are unknown, but autoimmune and inflammatory causes account for 20% of dementia in patients younger than 45 years of age. Autoimmune dementias are classified according to syndromic presentation, specific serologic markers, or histopathologic findings. Patients with autoimmune dementias usually present with an acute or subacute disorder of memory, thinking, or behaviour. Clinical clues that can help clinicians identify autoimmune dementias include six of the following: (i) rapidly progressive or fluctuating course; (ii) multifocal and diverse clinical presentations; (iii) personal or family history of autoimmunity; (iv) detection of inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid; (v) presence of a neural-specific autoantibody and (vi) favourable response to a trial of immunotherapy. Also, unsuspected cancer, new or recurrent, may manifest neurologically as autoimmune dementia. In evaluating patients with dementia and autoimmune disease, clinicians should be aware of the possible coexistence of these disorders. Conclusions: Recognition of clinical and serologic clues to autoimmune dementia allows early and sustained treatment. Misdiagnosis of a potentially reversible condition as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder can have devastating consequences for the patient and family.",

      "abstract": "The upcoming 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a unique opportunity to improve the representation of painful disorders. For this purpose, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has convened an interdisciplinary task force of pain specialists. Here, we present the case for a reclassification of nervous system lesions or diseases associated with persistent or recurrent pain for ≥3 months. The new classification lists the most common conditions of peripheral neuropathic pain: trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and painful radiculopathy. Conditions of central neuropathic pain include pain caused by spinal cord or brain injury, poststroke pain, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Diseases not explicitly mentioned in the classification are captured in residual categories of ICD-11. Conditions of chronic neuropathic pain are either insufficiently defined or missing in the current version of the ICD, despite their prevalence and clinical importance. We provide the short definitions of diagnostic entities for which we submitted more detailed content models to the WHO. Definitions and content models were established in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the IASP's Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG). Up to 10% of the general population experience neuropathic pain. The majority of these patients do not receive satisfactory relief with existing treatments. A precise classification of chronic neuropathic pain in ICD-11 is necessary to document this public health need and the therapeutic challenges related to chronic neuropathic pain.",

In addition to classical CIDP, there are many variant presentations, so-called atypical forms, such as pure motor, pure sensory, regional (restricted to the upper or lower limbs), multifocal (Lewis-Sumner syndrome), and distal patterns.2 The diagnosis of CIDP can be established when patients meet carefully delineated clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory criteria,1,2 but may be more challenging in cases with atypical presentations. Further difficulties arise when nerve conduction studies are inadequately performed or trivial nerve conduction abnormalities are labeled demyelinating. Misdiagnosis of CIDP leads to inappropriate and often long-term use of corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin (IVIg), with the potential for adverse effects and an enormous financial burden to the health care system.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

      "title": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy matters in daily life",
      "abstract": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is a neuro-cognitive dysfunction which occurs in an epidemic proportion of cirrhotic patients, estimated as high as 80% of the population tested. It is characterized by a specific, complex cognitive dysfunction which is independent of sleep dysfunction or problems with overall intelligence. Although named \"minimal\", minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) can have a far-reaching impact on quality of life, ability to function in daily life and progression to overt hepatic encephalopathy. Importantly, MHE has a profound negative impact on the ability to drive a car and may be a significant factor behind motor vehicle accidents. A crucial aspect of the clinical care of MHE patients is their driving history, which is often ignored in routine care and can add a vital dimension to the overall disease assessment. Driving history should be an integral part of care in patients with MHE. The lack of specific signs and symptoms, the preserved communication skills and lack of insight make MHE a difficult condition to diagnose. Diagnostic strategies for MHE abound, but are usually limited by financial, normative or time constraints. Recent studies into the inhibitory control and critical flicker frequency tests are encouraging since these tests can increase the rates of MHE diagnosis without requiring a psychologist. Although testing for MHE and subsequent therapy is not standard of care at this time, it is important to consider this in cirrhotics in order to improve their ability to live their life to the fullest.",

The clinical importance of this type of sleep disruption in critically ill patients, however, is not known. This article reviews the literature on sleep disruption in the ICU, the effects of sepsis on sleep, the effects of commonly used ICU medications on sleep, the relationship between sleep and sedation, and the literature on the biological and psychological consequences of sleep deprivation specifically as it relates to the critically ill.

A definitive diagnosis rested on a family history, age of onset, and the characteristic circumpapillary microangiopathy of the optic disc in the acute phase. However, recent demonstration of point mutations of mitochondrial DNA in affected individuals means that confirmation of the diagnosis can now be obtained in atypical or sporadic cases.2",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders associated with Streptococcal Infections) identifies a subgroup of pts with unusually abrupt and dramatic TIC/OCD onset GAS infection related. PANS \"Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome\" is a term proposed to describe a clinically distinct presentation of OCD/TIC with post infectious origin. Differently from PANDAS, in PANS other agents may trigger the disease, including <i>Mycoplasma pneumonia</i>, Influenza viruses, Epstein Barr virus, <i>Borrelia Burgdorferi</i>, Herpes simplex and Varicella viruses. Clinical presentation is characterized by an abrupt dramatic onset of OCD and additional neuropsychiatric symptoms nor explained by known neurologic or medical disorders<sup>1</sup>. <h3>Objectives</h3> To describe clinical features of 23 Italian children with OCD/TIC diagnosed as PANS in comparison to our PANDAS group. <h3>Methods</h3> Between May 2009 through January 2016 we recruited 23 pts (13 M, 10 F) with OCD/TIC starting before puberty. The mean age at onset 77 mnths±35.6SD. <h3>Results</h3> 19 (86.4%) were full-term born, 3 (13.6%) from Caesarean section (no information in 1 adopted child). 8/21 (38.1%) had familiars with OCD/tics or other neurologic diseases (2 pts without data). At onset, clinical signs were OCD in 3 (13%), OCD and motor tics in 7 (30.4%), motor tics in 5 (21.7%), vocal tics in 1 (4.3%), motor/vocal tics in 5 (21.7%), motor/vocal tics and OCD in 2 (8.7%), Mean age at diagnosis 106.8 months±36.9 SD. Antistreptolysin O and antiDNaseB titers were negative in all pts. In all <i>EBV</i>, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, <i>CMV</i>, <i>Borrelia Burgdorferi</i> were tested: 2 pts had history of tick bite and <i>Borrelia Burgorferi</i> Ab+, 6 pts Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ab+, 1 EBV Ab+; in 2 pts a VZV infectionAb+ was found. In 1 child Rotavirus infection was suspected and 12 had a viral pharyngitis before OCD/Tics onset. All underwent neuropsychiatric evaluation, none had deficit of psychological development; in all autoimmunity (ANA; antiDNA and ENA Ab) was negative as well as cerebral MR and EEG. All received antibiotic therapy according to the specific infection: pts with <i>Mycoplasma</i> macrolide, pts with <i>VZV</i> antiviral, pts with <i>Borrelia</i> amoxicillina. All showed benefit during and after the treatment. Pts, with no specific agent, received amoxicillina and benzathine benzylpenicillin with benefit after a more prolonged period than PANDAS pts. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our data show that PANS as PANDAS prediliges males with higher familiar predisposition in PANS. The age at onset is comparable to PANDAS, while OCD are more common and severe than in PANDAS. All pts had an infectious event, as PANDAS pts, but the trigger agent was different from GAS, and all responded to the specific therapy. PANDAS and PANS mainly differs from the trigger agent. The knowledge of PANS and PANDAS is mandatory to early recognize children at the disease onset avoiding to delay the diagnosis and the beginning of therapy. <h3>Acknowledgement</h3> <sup>1</sup>Chang K et al.

However, this mild cognitive impairment affects several areas: visuospatial, memory, attention and fluency and it is a significant concern because it decreases the quality of life and treatment adherence of these patients. On the other hand, evidence suggests that individuals with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) also present an important risk of falls: 46% of these patients experience a fall/year, sometimes with fatal consequences. Standard clinical balance measures can predict the risk of falls in this population. Moreover, increased inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the decrease of cognitive functions and a higher risk of falls in this population. Patients with COPD have a higher balance and cognitive impairment than their healthy peers Therefore, it is important to identify, assess and understand the relevance of these comorbidities in order to characterize the full clinical spectrum of COPD and adjust prevention strategies, given the devastating consequences of these problems.",

      "abstract": "Sensory neuropathies are combined with distal ulceromutilating changes of the lower extremities and should be classified under neurocutaneous syndromes. Clinically cutaneous, osseous, and arthropathic symptoms prevail, often for years. The process underlying the sensory neuropathies, however, obviously is a primary neurologic one. Preliminarily we discriminate true hereditary forms of the types I and II, so-called sporadic forms (presumably hidden hereditary = ,,idiopathic\"), and well-defined symptomatic forms, e.g. sequelae of alcohol abuse or malabsorption, diabetes, certain intoxications or leprosy. The variable clinical picture frequently and typically begins with dissociated sensible losses at one extremity taking an altogether torpid course that easily escapes attention. Rarely specific associated symptoms and combinations with Friedreich's ataxia, peroneal muscular atrophy, and kindred disorders are diagnosed. The progressing disease first involves non-myelinated and small-calibrated myelinated fibres which explains part of the clinical symptomatology. Microscopically in typical cases primary axonal changes beginning distally and ascending in non-myelinated fibres are striking. The neuropathologic parameters in the spinal animal ganglia, the dorsal root entrance zone or inside the myelon are scarcely studied in more detail and therefore little known up to now. Authoritative investigations of the sympathetic chain or of vegetative spinal elements are lacking. Demonstrable is among others a raised shunt blood flow which apparently is responsible for the worsening of nutrition.",

      "title": "SAT0566 Electroneurographic findings in patients with subacute/chronic articular symptoms of chikungunya fever and neuropathic complaints – preliminary results",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> The mechanisms of nonarticular pain associated with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection are still poorly understood. Many patients that progress to Subacute/Chronic phases have neuropathic pain (NP) besides the articular symptoms. The NP is associated with a less favorable outcome, with greater impact on quality of life and lower efficacy of treatment. The NP can reflect a dysfunction of the nervous system, rather than a neurological lesion induced by CHIKV, but the pathophysiology of the neural disfunction is not completely understood. There are no studies evaluating the electroneurographic findings in patients with CHIKV infection and neuropathic symptoms. <h3>Objectives</h3> To evaluate the results of electroneurography (ENoG) of patients with Chikungunya Fever (CF) and neuropathic symptoms. <h3>Methods</h3> Patients with diagnosis of CF (clinical and epidemiological) and symptoms of paresthesias underwent ENMG of upper and lower limbs. The electrodiagnostic evaluation consisted of nerve conduction study of median, ulnar, tibial, fibular, sural and plantar nerves. Clinical and epidemiological data were also recorded. <h3>Results</h3> The sample was composed by 18 patients (82.3% females) with mean age of 56 (±9.9) years. The mean duration of symptoms of CF at the time of the ENoG was 23.8 (±10.8) weeks and the average of tender and swollen joints (including ankle and foot) was 29.6 (±21.5) and 9 (±9.9), respectively. The mean score of visual analogic scale (VAS) for pain was 4.4 (±2.4) and for fatigue was 5.9 (±2.9), considering values between 0 and 10. No patient presented axial pain and the number of painful joints was higher in upper (19.4±13.9) compared to lower limbs (10.2±8.4). Only 3 patients reported unspecific paresthesias prior to the onset of arbovirosis and worsening after CF. However, these 3 patients had normal ENoG. Six patients had diabetes. Mononeuropathy was the most frequent result occurring in 12 subjects (67%). Bilateral mononeuropathy of median nerve (at carpal tunnel) was found in 11 patients and one subject had median neuropathy just on the left hand. Other mononeuropathies were also present: bilateral tibial nerve in 4, bilateral plantar nerve in 2 and bilateral fibular nerve in 1 patient. Distal axonal polyneuropathy was present in 8 cases (6 sensory and 2 sensorimotor); 5 of these were diabetic. The ENoG was normal in 4 cases. Ten patients were in use of prednisone (mean dose 11.4mg/d) and just 6 were using antineurophatic agents. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Our preliminary results indicate that the ENoG is altered in most patients with chronic articular manifestations of CF and associated paresthesias. Mononeuropathy is the most commom finding, even in the chronic phase of the disease when the nonarticular edema is not common. Further clinical studies with a larger number of patients and follow-up tests will be needed to confirm our data. <h3>References</h3> Andrade DC, Jean S, Clavelou P et al.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Neurocognitive impairment in moyamoya disease is common, under recognized, and potentially devastating. The purpose of this paper is to provide an updated overview on this topic for the practicing clinician. We searched PubMed for keywords including cognitive impairment, neurocognitive dysfunction, and neuropsychological recovery in moyamoya disease. We summarized the literature to provide a concise review of the treatment and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with moyamoya disease. Neuropsychiatric sequelae have conventionally been attributed to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and/or stroke. Cognitive dysfunction in adults with moyamoya disease is most commonly in the form of impaired executive function, whereas intelligence is the predominant impairment in children with moyamoya disease. Pharmacotherapy for treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with moyamoya disease is appropriate and can improve quality of life; however, careful consideration is needed to avoid adverse cerebrovascular events. It remains unclear as to whether surgical revascularization improves or stabilizes cognitive performance and outcomes. Additional prospective studies are warranted to better understand the long-term impact of revascularization on cognitive functioning in moyamoya disease.

The interplay of central nervous system (CNS) and the endocrine system may contribute to the increasingly identified cognitive dysfunction. The chapter focuses on central diabetes insipidus (DI), which may develop not only in the setting of neurosurgery, but also at the time of patient's presentation when the disease involves the hypothalamus or the pituitary stalk. Pituitary headache tends to be more anterior, bilateral, constant, and of moderately severe to excruciating intensity. Pituitary disease is associated with obesity, and osteoporosis or low bone density. Lesions within the hypothalamus and pituitary region or interventions to treat these lesions can lead to permanent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Pituitary lesions may produce both afferent and efferent visual dysfunction due to the intimate relationships between the pituitary gland and the ocular motor nerves.",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblostosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a spectrum of neuropsychiatric deformities, characterized by hallucination, delusion, mood disorders, speech pathology, and neurocognitive deficits. Among various clinical manifestations, hallucination has been recognized as a core psychotic symptom that occurs more frequently in schizophrenia. A significant number of subjects with neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucinations. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the specific cellular mechanism contributing to hallucinations remains ambiguous. Neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of the brain has been identified as a predominant pathogenic determinant of dementia. While the scientific proof for the neurodegeneration in schizophrenia is limited, the occurrence of dementia in schizophrenia has become increasingly evident. To note, both neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric disorders display impaired neurogenesis in the brain. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been linked to dementia and mood disorders. Notably, the early phase of many neurodegenerative disorders has been characterized by reactive neuroblostosis and aberrant cell cycle activation in mature neurons leading to the fluctuation in neurogenic processes leading to abnormal synaptogenesis and neurotransmission in the brain. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

A 22-year-old male presented with a 10 day history of headache, followed by decreased vision in both eyes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed sluggishly reactive pupils with anterior uveitis, mild vitritis and hyperaemic discs with bilateral exudative retinal detachments. All uveitis workups were negative. Follow up of three years revealed no neurological or auditory symptoms. Headache alone, followed by decreased vision, before the onset of neurological and auditory symptoms, can be an initial presentation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome.

In patients with mucopolysaccharidosis II, glycosaminoglycans accumulate within tissues and organs, contributing to the signs and symptoms of the disease. Mucopolysaccharidosis II affects multiple organs and physiologic systems and has a variable age of onset and variable rate of progression. Common presenting features include excess urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion, facial dysmorphism, organomegaly, joint stiffness and contractures, pulmonary dysfunction, myocardial enlargement and valvular dysfunction, and neurologic involvement. In patients with neurologic involvement, intelligence is impaired, and death usually occurs in the second decade of life, whereas those patients with minimal or no neurologic involvement may survive into adulthood with normal intellectual development. Enzyme replacement therapy has emerged as a new treatment for mucopolysaccharidosis disorders, including Hunter syndrome. The purpose of this report is to provide a concise review of mucopolysaccharidosis II for practitioners with the hope that such information will help identify affected boys earlier in the course of their disease.",

      "abstract": "The NNRTI efavirenz has long been one of the most frequently employed antiretroviral drugs in the multidrug regimens used to treat HIV infection, in accordance with its well-demonstrated antiretroviral efficacy and favourable pharmacokinetics. However, growing concern about its adverse effects has sometimes led to efavirenz being replaced by other drugs in the initial treatment selection or to switching of therapy to efavirenz-free regimens in experienced patients. Neurological and neuropsychiatric reactions are the manifestations most frequently experienced by efavirenz-treated patients and range from transitory effects, such as nightmares, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness and lack of concentration, to more severe symptoms including depression, suicidal ideation or even psychosis. In addition, efavirenz has recently been associated with mild/moderate neurocognitive impairment, which is of specific relevance given that half of the patients receiving ART eventually suffer some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. The mechanisms responsible for efavirenz-induced neurotoxicity are unclear, although growing evidence points to disturbances in brain mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the interaction that efavirenz displays with the CNS, including the penetration and concentration of the drug in the brain. We discuss the prevalence, types and specificities of its side effects and recently uncovered cellular mechanisms that may be involved in their development.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term covering a group of non-progressive, but often changing, motor impairment syndromes secondary to lesions or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of its development (DM & CN, 1992, 34: 547–55). Cerebral palsy is the most frequent motor impairment in childhood, but, it is more than merely a motor disorder. There can be also problems of development, perceptual- cognitive impairment, social and functional problems of daily living, emotional and behavioural problems, Epilepsy, and many other difficulties. There are an estimated 15 million people with cerebral palsy around the world and more then half of them are mentally retarded and one third have epilepsy How to treat it? Having in mind a broad spectrum of differences in age of persons at which firm diagnosis is made, inclusions and exclusions criteria, denominator for clinical features (topographical or other classification), and especially what was a cause and timing of insult, size and location of lesion, maturational state of system injured, integrity of areas surrounding and contralateral to lesion, genetic and environmental background, gene-gene and geneenvironment interactions, and intervening conditions (timing of start, quality, duration and intensity), it is obvious that there are currently no evidence-based strategies for preventing cerebral palsy and to say which method of treatment is superior. In addition to this fact we should find a balance between physiotherapy (among them nowadays the most used Neurodevelopmental treatment – Bobath, Vojta, Conductive education and Constrain induced therapy), pharmacology, and neurosurgical approaches (Local anaesthetics, Local neurolytics -Alcohol, Phenol-, Botulinum toxin, Baclofen pump, Selective dorsal rhizotomy, Peripheral neurectomy, Deep brain stimulation). Beside this there are many not proven therapies (Biofeedback, Functional Motor Learning, Acupuncture, The “Adeli” suit, Hyperbaric oxygenation, Homeopathy, Bio-energy, and others). Gene and transplantation therapies? Even for genetic causes of early brain lesions (e.g. as is thrombophilias) are only a very small proportion of potential candidate genes have been examined to date, how can we expect that in the near future we will have a gene therapy. Stem cells – to repopulate brain? Indeed, there is now ample evidence that stem cells exist in the central nervous system throughout life, and the progeny of these stem cells may have the ability to assume the functional role of neural cells that have been lost. In addition, once transplanted, stem cells have been shown to survive, migrate, and differentiate. But nevertheless, the clinical utility of stem cell therapy for neurorestoration remains elusive.",

Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição. O presente trabalho visa discutir o caso clínico de uma paciente de 73 anos diagnosticada e tratada cirurgicamente para hidrocefalia, abordando os sinais e sintomas, diagnósticos diferenciais e as melhorias na qualidade de vida após realização do adequado tratamento cirúrgico.",

      "title": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP): Overview, Treatment, and a Case Study",
      "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is an uncommon immune-mediated neuropathy with an often unknown etiology. Patients typically present with gradual muscle weakness, sensory loss, and reduced deep tendon reflexes. Diagnostic challenges persist due to the absence of specific lab findings and definitive criteria. Treatment commonly involves glucocorticoids, IVIG, or plasma exchange, with varied long-term outcomes. We aim to elucidate the diagnostic complexities and treatment modalities associated with chronic CIDP through a comprehensive review of a patient's clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic interventions. A 70-year-old female with a complex medical history, including dermatomyositis and IgG subclass deficiency, presented with progressive lower extremity weakness and numbness. Initial workup including MRI and CT scans were inconclusive. She was diagnosed with CIDP based on electromyography (EMG)/nerve conduction studies and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Plasma exchange (PLEX) treatment was initiated but led to multifocal cerebral infarcts, complicating her course. Subsequent rounds of PLEX alongside dual antiplatelet therapy showed no adverse neurological events and yielded minimal to moderate improvement in her mobility. The patient was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation center for continued care. Elevated WBCs and other abnormal lab results were monitored throughout, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach in complex cases like this one. Our comprehensive overview of CIDP and its diagnostic and treatment complexities underscores the challenges clinicians face in both accurate diagnosis and effective management. The multifaceted approach - spanning history-taking, electrodiagnostic studies, and advanced imaging - highlights the necessity for a nuanced, evidence-based practice. The variability in treatment outcomes emphasizes the need for personalized medicine and continuous research to optimize therapeutic strategies. Given the inconclusive nature of some diagnostic tools and the variable treatment responses, there remains a clear need for ongoing study and long-term follow-up to further refine our understanding and management of CIDP.",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Many experts suggest that this syndrome is the late-twentieth-century formulation of an illness that has been described under various designations in medical literature for centuries, such as febricula (“little fevers”) in the eighteenth century, neurasthenia in the nineteenth century, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), in Great Britain and Canada, or chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), in the United States, during the late twentieth century. The designation chronic fatigue syndrome was adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) because this name does not assume a direct role for infection, inflammation, or immune system dysfunction in the genesis of the symptoms. Indeed, an abundance of research has failed to attribute the syndrome to any specific infection or immunologic disturbance. Nevertheless, CFS concerns infectious disease physicians because it is frequently recognized as a sequel of infection, i.e., as postviral or postinfectious fatigue.",

MHE patients have deficits in attention that are compounded by impaired response inhibition, working memory, and visuo-motor coordination. All these are important skills for driving a vehicle. Adding to this impairment is the lack of insight and predisposition to fatigue. These patients lack the neurologic exam findings and historical symptoms for diagnosis, and as MHE is estimated to have a prevalence of 22–80%, this becomes particularly important when pertaining to the responsibility of driving an automobile or commercial vehicle. Diagnosis of MHE requires specialized testing and is often difficult to detect, and physician reporting to state driver regulatory organizations is riddled with ethical and legal dilemmas. Significant strides have been made in better understanding how MHE affects patient's everyday lives, including important functions such as driving. This improved understanding will improve awareness and road safety for both patients with cirrhosis and other chronic illnesses as well as the general public.",

      "title": "A case of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis",
      "abstract": "To the Editor,\r\n\r\nCongenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease which is also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 4 (1). The prominent characteristics of the disease include fever due to anhidrosis, absence of sense of pain, painless ulcers in the structures inside the mouth and extremities, self-harm behavior, mild to severe mental retardation, myelination defect in the sural nerve biopsy and loss of small myelinized fibers. Infection in the fingers and toes, lips and tongue and scarring is observed commonly. Keratoderma palmoplantaris is a typical finding in the advanced period (1, 2). Other problems include chronic bone and joint infections.\r\n\r\nInability to sense pain and absence of hidrosis in the patients arise from absence of sympathetic nerve supply of the afferent neurons of pain and eccrine sweat glands due to tissue damage. These neurons originate from neural crest cells and are localized in the dorsal root ganglion. The cell is stimulated by the “Nerve Growth Factor” (NGF) and TRKA receptors. TRKA is a tyrosine kinase receptor with high affinity and is activated by NGF. In patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis syndrome, mutations in the TRKA (NTRK1) gene which codes the TRKA receptor have been defined. Since congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis syndrome is a rare disease, a child with this syndrome is presented here to draw attention to early diagnosis.\r\n\r\nA 10 year-old male patient presented to the pediatric emergency department with fever, ulcers on the skin which did not heal and erythema on the left amputated extremity. It was learned that the complaint of fever recurred intermittently since the delivery and he was frequently hospitalized because a focus of infection could not be found, his left foot was amputated because of chronic osteomyelitis approximately one year ago, multiple ulcers occured on his feet, hands, fingers and toes, knees and elbows from the time he started to walk, some of these ulcers healed, but some healed with much difficulty and even did not heal and some fingers were lost because the ulcers did not heal, he never sweated from the time of delivery and did not feel pain when he was exposed to any trauma. He had frequent hospitalizations because of skin infection and fever, recurrent febrile convulsions and follow-up with a diagnosis of keratoderma in dermatology clinics where he was referred because of skin lesions in his personal history. He had no additional pathology in his familial history. On physical examination, his consciousness was open, he had no interest for the environment, he did not speak and there was no eye contact, he had mental retardation. His weight and height were compatible with his peers. Pulse rate: 96/min, blood pressure: 115/70 mmHg, fever: 39°C, respiratory rate: 28/min, oxygen saturation: 99%. Oral hygiene was poor, varying degrees of eruptions were present in the tooth, cracked and eroded lesions were present in the tongue and lips and tissue loss was present in the distal parts of the fingers (Figure 1). Eroded and ulcerated lesions were present between various fingers and toes from place to place. Hyperkeratotic swollen lesions with irregular surface were observed especially around the knees and elbows. The left lower extremity was amputated in the middle of the tibia and there was erythema, induration and increased warmth on the amputation area (Figure 2). There was an sharply circumscribed ulcerated lesion with dimensions of 2×3 cm on an erythematous background sunken from the surface (Figure 3). Cranial nerve examination and muscle strength were found to be normal. Muscle tonus was mildly reduced. Deep tendon reflexes were normoactive. He was insensitive against deep and superficial pain stimuli. No marked pathology was found on the examination of the other systems. Laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 16 800/mm3, absolute neutrophil count 10 300/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count 4 400/mm3, Hb 9.5 g/dL, MCV 77.9 fL/mm3, RDW 15.9%, platalet count 362 000/mm3, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 77 mm/h, C-reactive protein 97.3 mg/dL, blood glucose 87 mg/dL, BUN 8 mg/dL, creatinine 0.3 mg/dL, uric acid 2.2 mg/dL, creatinine kinase 55 U/L. Serum electrolytes were within the normal limits. Chormosome analysis of the patient was found to be 46 XY. Electromyography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging, serum vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc levels were found to be normal. Serum immunoglobulins were compatible with the age. The pilocarpin iontophoresis test was found to be negative. He had moderate mental retardation according to the “Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children”. The patient was hospitalized in the ward because of congenital insensitivity to pain and soft tissue infection. Antibiotic treatment was started after obtaining samples for blood culture and wound site culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.\r\n\r\nTissue loss and deformations in the distal parts of the fingers, contracture and unhealing wounds in the fingers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2.\r\n\r\nHyperemia in the skin in the distal part of the left amputated lower exremity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3.\r\n\r\nUlcerated necrotic lesion in the periphery on the right patella which has not healed for a long time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPain is a warning, preventive or therapeutic, protective function against damage. When a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis seriously injures himself/ herself, injury is generally not recognized and permanent wounds occur as a result. Hydrosis is an important function to keep the body temperature within normal limits in warm environments. Anhidrosis leads to recurrent febrile convulsions due to disruption in maintanence of the body temperature and hyperthermia. In patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis syndrome, absense of sense of pain and heat is related with absence of nerve supply of the fibers which conduct the sense of pain and of the eccrine sweat glands (3). Insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis were prominent characteristics in our patient.\r\n\r\nIn patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, oral lesions, tissue loss in the fingers, tongue and lips, wound site infection, acute and chronic osteomyelitis, finger amputations and joint abnormalities are frequently found because of self harm behavior (1). In these patients, the pilocarpin iontophoresis test is negative. In the literature, nerve supply of the eccrine sweat glands have been found histopathologically in some patients despite a negative pilocarpine iontophoresis test (2). However, Sztriha et al. (1) showed that the present nerve fiber were dysfunctional with immunohistochemical staining methods. Our patient had a clinical history of anhidrosis and the pilocarpin iontophoresis test was found to be negative.\r\n\r\nFindings including hypotonia, absence of deep tendon reflexes or decreased deep tendon reflexes are expected in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (1). Loss of muscle fibers, variability in their size, appearance of a central nucleus, endomisial fibrosis and presence of vacuolar formation are known in patients with CIPA. It is thought that changes in muscle and deep tendon reflexes are related with chronic neuropathic and myopathic changes (4, 5).\r\n\r\nIn patients with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis, mental retardation is observed frequently. Although microcephaly is an expected finding, enlargement in the ventricles and hydrocephaly have been found in some patients (6). Our patient had mental retardation, but magnetic resonance imaging findings were found to be normal.\r\n\r\nWhen the nerve growth factor (NGF)-TRKA system does not function fully, the nerve fibers which are related with the sense of pain and which provide specific nerve supply to the eccrine sweat glands are absent in the organism or do not function (3). It is known that the nerve growth factor has a regulatory role in neuroimmune and endocrine interaction and it has been found in periosteal osteoprogenitor cells. Changes in the functions of these cells may be a facilitating factor in skeletal involvement in patients with CIPA. Many and varying types of mutations have been found in the TRKA gene. The disease is most probably inherited with autosomal dominant inheritance, but it has also been shown to be inherited by “unipaternal” disomy (1, 3). Thus, this should be kept in mind when giving genetic counseling service to patients with CIPA.",

I propose that these impairments can be best understood in terms of the abnormal processes underlying the signs and symptoms manifested by the patient at the time of the cognitive assessment. Negative signs such as poverty of speech are associated with defects of willed action, while positive symptoms such as hallucinations are associated with defects of self-monitoring. Hypotheses about the brain systems underlying these processes can be examined using functional brain imaging.",

This may be more prominent in patients with lower intelligence levels. Twenty‐six patients with psychogenic neurological disorders (PND) were tested for coping abilities and intelligence and compared with 18 healthy controls and 26 patients with various nonpsychogenic disorders. Patients with PND have slightly lower IQ levels and active coping skills compared with healthy controls but not to nonpsychogenic patients. Low IQ was not associated with low active coping skills in either of the groups. Low active coping is not the result of low IQ and is not specific for psychogenic symptoms. At least part of the lower coping skills reported in patients with psychogenic symptoms may be the result of having an illness in general. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

We should understand the pathology of CP, which causes various dysfunctions other than motor disturbances, for delivering a comprehensive treatment. Rapid progress in perinatal medicine has altered the underlying brain lesions. Bilateral spastic CP associated with visual cognitive impairment due to periventricular leukomalacia has becomethe most prevalent instead of dyskinetic CP due to kernicterus. New types of brain lesions found in very premature infants will be more common among adult CP in the future. Cerebellar injury causes disturbances in cognition and communication, and bilirubin encephalopathy causes severe motor impairment with marked dystonia. The latter needs various medical treatments, including botulinum toxin and intrathecal baclofen. Elevated risk of lifestyle-related and psychological diseases should also be considered.",

Retrobulbar optic neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis is the most common disease (neuropathy) of the optic nerve in young adults and often the first clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Despite a characteristic triad of symptoms and evident focal demyelination in brain magnetic resonance, misdiagnoses still occur. Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (atrophy) is a genetic mitochondrial disease, which manifests as a subacute painless loss of vision, and thus can be mistaken for retrobulbar optic neuritis. The coexistence of hereditary optic neuropathy and Harding’s syndrome is another diagnostic difficulty. All these three conditions, the peak of incidence of which occurs in the second to third decade of life, initially manifest only with visual symptoms due to uni- or bilateral optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain may show demyelination, while optical coherence tomography of the fundus may detect thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layers in all these neuropathies. We present clinical differences, as well as variances in retinal optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging between retrobulbar optic neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy with multiple sclerosis-like disease.",

The complexity of the relationship is highlighted in certain genetic conditions such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke in which migraine and stroke are both prominent clinical features.",

The current case report is of a 43-year-old male who presented with isolated psychiatric symptoms to the psychiatric outpatient department. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms, neurology referral and magnetic resonance imaging brain were done, which showed no significant abnormality. With altered laboratory parameters and psychiatric symptoms, the patient was started with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, antivirals, antipsychotics, and other supportive care. Since there was no improvement in symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid analysis for encephalitis mosaic panel was done, which demonstrated antibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

However, the phenomenology of psychotic symptoms in this syndrome has not been well described in the literature. As such, in this brief report, we review the literature with respect to the occurrence of psychosis in Kleefstra syndrome and describe the symptom profile of a 35-year-old affected male with an intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia (in association with manic features). This is the first report of psychotic symptoms fully remitting in response to zuclopenthixol therapy in an individual with Kleefstra syndrome.

Six hundred ninety-two community dwelling older adults were enrolled through their primary care physicians and evaluated for medical burden and cognition. Medical burden was assessed by self-report questionnaire. Cognition was assessed with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). After adjusting for age and gender, there was a strong inverse relationship between medical burden and cognition, with individuals with more medical comorbidities performing worse on cognitive measures. Attention was selectively poor, especially for a speeded, divided attention task, in patients with five or more comorbid medical conditions. These findings could have clinical implications, as poorer attention, especially in patients with multiple medical problems, could lead to poorer medical compliance and worse outcomes.",

      "title": "Pathomechanisms and Clinical Implications of Myasthenic Syndromes Exacerbated and Induced by Medical Treatments",
      "abstract": "Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences. In this article, we aim to summarize existing evidence regarding the key molecular and immunological mechanisms as well as the clinical implications of medication-aggravated and medication-induced myasthenic syndromes.",

      "title": "Coexistent ankylosing spondylitis and intellectual developmental disorder with behavioral abnormalities and craniofacial dysmorphism with or without seizures",
      "abstract": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease mainly affecting the axial skeleton, with chronic back pain and spinal stiffness as primary presenting symptoms.1 AS is heritable and exhibits familial aggregation.2 The disease course is frequently complicated with other immune diseases, cardiovascular disease, and depression.3 Intellectual developmental disorder with behavioral abnormalities and craniofacial dysmorphism with or without seizures (IDDBCS) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM]: 618725) is an autosomal dominant inherited multisystem involvement syndrome caused by mutation in the PHD finger protein 21A (PHF21A) gene (OMIM: 608325). IDDBCS is characterized by intellectual developmental disorder or varying degrees of intellectual disability accompanied by motor skills impairment and language delay; macrocephaly, obesity, and overgrowth are also common manifestations. Neurobehavioral disorders, including autism, are common, and approximately half of the patients have seizures.4, 5 In 2019, Hamanaka et al..5 first reported heterozygous mutations in the PHF21A gene in patients with IDDBCS The PHF21A gene is located on chromosome 11p11.2 and encodes BHC80, a component of the BRAF35-histone deacetylase complex (BHC), which is involved in transcriptional repression of neuron-specific genes and expressed highly in brain and skeletal muscle.5, 6 PHF21A haploinsufficiency is associated with intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies.7 To date, 15 cases have been reported involving microdeletion frameshift or nonsense variants in the PHF21A gene.4, 5, 8-13 This report describes AS coexisting with a PHF21A-related disorder. The patient was a 16-year-old Chinese boy who was the first child of unrelated parents. He was born full-term after an uneventful pregnancy and vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 8 kg. Signs of developmental delay and intellectual disabilities appeared early in life. He learned to crawl at 12 months and to walk at 18 months and experienced poor balance and motor coordination. Speech delay was also present. He learned to say short sentences at 2.5 years of age. At 1 year of age, he underwent surgery to correct an atrioventricular septal defect. The patient visited the Rheumatology Clinic of Shandong Provincial Hospital at 14 years old with a complaint of 1.5 years of low back pain, which had developed gradually. He experienced morning stiffness that improved with exercise but not with rest. At presentation, he weighed 93 kg (97th percentile), and his height was 178 cm (97th percentile). He showed the unique features of a broad forehead, low and flat nasal bridge, sparse teeth, and externally rotated ears. Physical examination revealed restricted spinal movement in both the sagittal and frontal planes and percussion tenderness over the T12–L2 spine; neurological examination findings were within normal limits. Laboratory testing demonstrated a positive human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) result, prolonged erythrocyte sedimentation rate (43 mm/h; reference range: 0–15 mm/h), and elevated C-reactive protein (15.60 mg/L; reference range: 0–5 mg/L) and interleukin 6 (15.41 pg/mL; reference range: 0–7 pg/mL) concentrations. Other routine laboratory examination results, such as blood counts, liver function, and blood biochemistry, were normal. Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, antidouble-stranded DNA antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, were absent. Tuberculosis screening tests, namely tuberculosis antibody, T-SPOT, and purified protein derivative tests, were negative; the result of rheumatoid factor testing was also negative. Lumbar and sacroiliac joint magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a normal physiological curve, narrowed intervertebral spaces, and a coarse margin of L1/2. MRI also showed inflammatory lesions, Hummer's nodules in L1 and L2, herniated intervertebral disks at L4/5 and L5/S1, and abnormal patchy high T1 signal intensity in bilateral sacroiliac joints, indicating sacroiliitis. Upon biopsy of the L2 vertebra, a slimy substance was detected, and pathological analysis revealed neutrophil proliferation and mild edema of the bone trabecula. No granulomatous inflammation, such as that seen with tuberculosis, was observed. Immunohistochemical studies showed that immunoglobulin G4, Congo red staining, and cluster of differentiation (CD)68 and CD117 evaluations were negative while CD235a was positive. As the patient was under 45 years of age and presented with more than one clinical criterion of AS, namely inflammatory low back pain for more than 3 months, limited lumbar spinal motion in both the sagittal and frontal planes and signs of bilateral sacroiliitis on MRI, the radiological criteria met the modified New York criteria for diagnosis of AS.14 The clinical features and test results did not support a diagnosis of diseases with similar manifestations, such as psoriasis; Reiter syndrome; synovitis, acne, pustulosis, and osteitis syndrome; diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis; enteropathic arthritis; and spinal tuberculosis. The patient had also visited the endocrinology department previously because of overgrowth and underwent relevant examinations, including hormone levels for the different pituitary axes, and pituitary MRI. As a result, endocrine and metabolic diseases such as acromegaly were ruled out because the hormone profile did not reveal abnormal results. Hence, we initiated therapy with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium 60 mg three times daily, which was subsequently changed to celecoxib 0.2 g twice daily) and injections of etanercept (25 mg twice weekly). However, the patient experienced no significant pain relief after 3 months of treatment. Therefore, we initiated 150 mg secukinumab therapy for the next 3 months instead. Adalimumab (40 mg biweekly) was given subcutaneously thereafter. However, the patient complained of persistent lower back pain at the most recent follow-up visit. The patient's father had proximal junctional kyphosis with a 10-year history of low back pain, and he suffered from intellectual disability. HLA-B27 testing revealed a positive result, and he had been diagnosed as having AS 1 year after his son was diagnosed. Other known family members were unaffected (Figure 1A). Whole exome sequencing was performed on a high throughput sequencing platform for the patient and his parents. Sequencing results were compared with reference genome hg19, and the pathogenicity of detected variants was evaluated in accordance with the 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines.15 The heterogeneous variant, PHF21A (NM_00110802.1) c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14), was identified and confirmed to be of paternal origin by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1B). In accordance with the 2015 ACMG guidelines, the c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14) variant was defined as the pathogenic variant on the basis of the following evidence: this was a known loss-of-function variant recorded in the Human Gene Mutation Database; the deletion of the 840th nucleobase of the PHF21A gene caused frameshift and premature termination of protein synthesis (p.S280Sfs*14) (PVS1); and this variant was absent from the population databases in the Genome Aggregation Database (PM2). IDDBCS is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the PHF21A gene. The PHF21A gene encodes BHC80, a subunit of BHC, and mediates negative regulation of neuron-specific gene expression. This occurs by recruitment at the cis-regulatory element (repressor element 1 or neuron-restrictive silencer element sites) by repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor. BCH80 acts as a chromatin modifier by regulating histone demethylation and deacetylation.16, 17 Histone methylation dysregulation is a major driver of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).18 Orthologous suppression of PHF21A in a zebrafish model caused neuronal apoptosis and abnormal development of the head, face, and jaw,7 supporting the etiological role of PHF21A in neural and craniofacial abnormalities. The high transcription levels of PHF21A in the brain and skeletal muscle further support its relationship with neurological and hypotonia phenotypes.4 Although the phenotypic spectrum of intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, facial anomalies, overgrowth, and obesity in our case was generally consistent with that of previously reported cases, the pathogenic variant carried by our patient differed from those in previous reports.4, 5, 12, 13 This finding reinforces that PHF21A haploinsufficiency could contribute to intellectual developmental disorders and facial dysmorphism. Compared with previous cases, our patient showed no obvious cranial anomalies, finger anomalies, epilepsy, hypotonia, or diagnosis of ASD or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Different nucleotide changes between previous cases and our case may account for the discrepancy mentioned above, with mutations possibly located in different exons. Satterstrom et al.10 identified a female patient who carried the same frameshift mutation in exon 9 as that in our patient. However, the clinical features in the report were not provided except for the presence of ASD. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to confirm a clear relationship between the phenotypic spectrum and specific nucleotide changes. Several possible reasons may explain the limited response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and biological agents in our patient. One is that the low back pain had mechanical features that resulted from spinal overload caused by obesity and/or an excessive vertebral growth rate. Another was that the drug dosages were insufficient owing to the patient's overweight. It is also possible that IDDBCS itself could have resulted in poor therapeutic effects; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear. We report the coexistence of AS and IDDBCS in a patient with a genetic familial history, and the paternally-inherited frameshift variant c.840del (p.S280Sfs*14) was detected in the PHF21A gene. PHF21A gene haploinsufficiency has been reconfirmed as a cause of neurobehavioral disorders and craniofacial dysmorphism. Our findings provide additional insight into phenotypes and genotypes of PHF21A-related disorders. However, an association between PHF21A gene disruption and the pathogenesis of AS was not confirmed and requires further research. Weizhen Xiang and Min Fu collected data and wrote the manuscript.

      "abstract": "A 14-year-old girl with closed head injury and a normal computerized tomographic scan underwent an electroencephalogrpahic tracing that surprisingly revealed typical status epilepticus electrical activity. No episodes of motor clinical convulsion were observed from the moment of trauma throughout the admission period. Treatment with phenytoin caused a dramatic clinical improvement. Repeated electroencephalogram (EEG) 4 days later was within normal limits. Posttraumatic seizures are reported after head injury, yet, the issue of \"invisible\" or \"subclinical\" seizures associated with trauma is not discussed. In these cases EEG, (an uncommon examination in the early period after head injury) may be the only tool for proper diagnosis and treatment with anticonvulsants. This case report raises the question of the role of EEG in the unconscious patient who does not present with obvious convulsions. Clinical indications for performing EEG after head trauma without seizures are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Paediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), is a rare but important differential diagnosis in children presenting with papilloedema. It is characterised by raised intracranial pressure in the absence of an identifiable secondary structural or systemic cause and is, therefore, a diagnosis of exclusion. In the adult population, there is a strong predilection for the disease to occur in female patients who are obese. This association is also seen in paediatric patients with IIH but primarily in the post-pubertal cohort. In younger pre-pubertal children, this is not the case, possibly reflecting a different underlying disease aetiology and pathogenesis. Untreated IIH in children can cause significant morbidity from sight loss, chronic headaches, and the psychological effects of ongoing regular hospital monitoring, interventions, and medication. The ultimate goal in the management of paediatric IIH is to protect the optic nerve from papilloedema-induced optic neuropathy and thus preserve vision, whilst reducing the morbidity from other symptoms of IIH, in particular chronic headaches. In this review, we will outline the typical work-up and diagnostic process for paediatric patients with suspected IIH and how we manage these patients.",

      "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease with important consequences on nervous system development, if not properly treated. Decrease of the antioxidative mechanisms, altered transport of amino acids through the blood-brain barrier, low brain protein synthesis, hypomyelination are the main contributors to the neural damage and central nervous system functional impairment. Diagnosis of PKU and hypothyroidism are part of the neonatal screening program for inborn diseases and an early diagnosis should be provided in order to prevent complications. We are reporting here a case of a late-diagnosed PKU with a p.L48S/ p.R408W genotype, with a clinical evolution more severe than in cases with similar genotype, despite a particularly good late response to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on the metabolic status. The severity of the evolution with persistent neuro-psychic impairment could be related to the associated subclinical hypothyroidism and the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) syndrome. Hypertrophic and hyperplasic obesity, cutis laxa and inverted nipples were also diagnosed and the BMI over the 99th percentile was maintained at those levels afterwards. In the discussion section, we review the literature covering the complexity of the mutual influences of these medical conditions in PKU patients. Through this case presentation, we underline the importance of neonatal screening as a major preventive action of neurological impairment. We also highlight the importance of performing genotyping in PKU and of a complete (48h) sapropterin test in order to avoid missing the late responders, in PKU patients with p.L48S/p.R408W genotype.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid-dependent mechanisms of inflammation-mediated distant hippocampal damage are discussed with a focus on the consequences of traumatic brain injury. The effects of glucocorticoids on specific neuronal populations in the hippocampus depend on their concentration, duration of exposure and cell type. Previous stress and elevated level of glucocorticoids prior to pro-inflammatory impact, as well as long-term though moderate elevation of glucocorticoids, may inflate pro-inflammatory effects. Glucocorticoid-mediated long-lasting neuronal circuit changes in the hippocampus after brain trauma are involved in late post-traumatic pathology development, such as epilepsy, depression and cognitive impairment. Complex and diverse actions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis on neuroinflammation may be essential for late post-traumatic pathology. These mechanisms are applicable to remote hippocampal damage occurring after other types of focal brain damage (stroke, epilepsy) or central nervous system diseases without obvious focal injury. Thus, the liaisons of excessive glucocorticoids/dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with neuroinflammation, dangerous to the hippocampus, may be crucial to distant hippocampal damage in many brain diseases. Taking into account that the hippocampus controls both the cognitive functions and the emotional state, further research on potential links between glucocorticoid signaling and inflammatory processes in the brain and respective mechanisms is vital.",

The febrile illnesses of the pyrexic subjects did not cause febrile seizures and resulted from diseases that did not directly involve the brain (e.g., encephalitis, meningitis, malaria). Control subjects were combat veterans who had suffered gunshot wounds, but who had no history of febrile illness. Pyrexic patients performed worse than controls on a variety of measures including language, memory, concentration, and word finding as well as failing a test of dichotic listening for words.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare and potentially dangerous autoimmune neuromuscular disease, which affects the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle. lt is characterized by fluctuating weakness and fatigue of the ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles and initial symptoms are usually ptosis and diplopia. Over half of patients with MG will initially experience isolated ocular symptoms in one eye or both eyes, which are called ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG). OMG’s diverse symptoms may readily masquerade as other neurological conditions, posing a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Case presentation: A 49-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a seven-day history of unilateral persistent ptosis with inflexible eye movement, concerning for oculomotor nerve paralysis initially. However, cranial CTA found no evidence of stroke or any other central etiology. Routine laboratory testing was unremarkable. Neurology was consulted and neurologist recommended sending tensilon testing (pharmacologically induced improvement in symptoms using the anticholinesterase inhibitor) and electromyographic testing. At the patient’s subsequent hospitalization in neurology department, these tests were found to be abnormal. The patient underwent complete ophthalmic examination and medical history review, was diagnosed of ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) eventually. The patient subsequently underwent hormone and immunosuppressive therapy with obvious improvement in her symptoms. Conclusions MG may present as unilateral ptosis or diplopia with the hallmark characteristic of fluctuating muscle weakness. Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of MG improve long term prognosis and remission rates. Prednisone is the most commonly used immune modulator for the treatment of MG. Emergency physicians should consider myasthenia gravis in cases of ocular symptoms after ruling-out emergent central etiologies.",

Vitamin deficiencies can also cause memory loss (especially vitamin B12, B1, and D). Hormonal imbalances, particularly thyroid disorders, can mimic memory disorders. Memory problems can also come from bodily stress, infections, and diseases (including Lyme disease, COVID-19, encephalitis, diabetes, major surgeries and anesthesia, organ failure, and poor sleep). Many neurologic disorders can cause memory problems, particularly if the hippocampus, frontal lobes, or temporal lobes are involved. Neurologic disorders include brain tumors, epilepsy and seizures, multiple sclerosis, strokes, transient global amnesia, and traumatic brain injury.

      "abstract": "Immune-mediate neuropathies, or inflammatory neuropathies are neuropathies due to the dysregulation of the immune system. The injury to peripheral nerves can be divided into two phases: an early stage of immune injury, and a later stage of structural damage. The overall effects are axonal degeneration or demyelination depending on the target of immunological attacks. According to time course, there are two major types: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Clinical manifestations of both diseases include progressive motor weakness and sensory disturbance with some variations among different patients. The major findings of nerve conduction studies on GBS patients are prolonged distal motor latencies and minimal F-wave latencies with variable reduction of nerve conduction velocities. In CIDP patients, slowed nerve conduction velocities are the usual findings in addition to prolongation of distal motor latencies and minimal F-wave latencies. Certain subtypes of immune-mediated neuropathies are associated with high titers of anti-gangliosdie antibodies. Patients with GBS and CIDP can benefit from immunotherapy. For GBS, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are equally effective in reducing complications and neurological disability. Steroid of high dose is, however, harmful to GBS. Plasma exchange and IVIG can alleviate neurological deficits of CIDP with steroid to maintain the effects of plasma exchange and IVIG. In conclusion, careful clinical observations and judgment are the most important issue to manage patients with immune-mediated neuropathies.",

      "abstract": "MONONEUROPATHY multiplex is a syndrome characterized by simultaneous or successive dysfunction of several peripheral nerve trunks remote from one another. It thus differs from polyneuropathy which implies a more diffuse and symmetrical disorder. The causes of mononeuropathy multiplex include polyarteritis nodosa, disseminated lupus erythematosis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemophilia, leprosy, trauma, and involvement of nerve by tumor. It also occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus, and when no other cause is found, it is attributed to the diabetes and is classified among the diabetic neuropathies. However, its relationship to the other forms of diabetic neuropathy is unclear, and as is the case for all of them, the pathology and the pathogenesis are unsettled. Diabetic mononeuropathy multiplex tends to affect elderly patients with mild, or undiscovered, diabetes. It has an acute or subacute onset with a tendency to recover over a period of months, and usually causes a painful, asymmetrical, often proximal",

Some patients deteriorate rapidly while others live for years, even after an illness that defines the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The reasons for these different rates of decline are not known, but psychosocial variables have been put on the list of possible host factors.<sup>1</sup>The notion has been that one's adaptive coping or fighting spirit might somehow delay or even prevent HIV's inexorable attack—and conversely, that distress and despair might measurably accelerate progression of the disease. See also pp 2563 and 2568. Such a notion is based on more than the understandable hope that one's mind can prevail over an illness with no known medical cure. Accumulating evidence supports the belief held since Hippocrates that vigor, resilience, and perceived support are associated with more favorable medical outcomes.<sup>2</sup>Furthermore, stress and depression have been shown to affect the immune",

Deficits characteristic of both cortical and subcortical dementias, depending on the location and extent of cerebrovascular lesions, may occur. Numerous neuropsychiatric sequelae are associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), making it difficult to identify a well-defined syndrome. Thorough psychiatric and medical histories are critical in diagnosing patients who present with agitation and cognitive changes. Laboratory and neuroimaging studies are of variable utility in evaluating for reversible causes of altered mental status. A number of medications have been studied for their effects on dementia-related agitation. The most common categories include antipsychotics, antiepileptic medications, antidepressants, and cognitive enhancers. Controlled studies on pharmacologic treatment for agitation in Huntington's disease are rare.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune multifocal inflammatory demyelinating disease with secondary neurodegeneration affecting predominantly females between 20-40 years. The clinical course over years is very variable. Milder cognitive dysfunctions in various conditions are very frequent in acute stage and in the further courses of the disease. Dementia is reported as a rare condition in MS. Rodriguez et al found in 1994 an incidence of 3,7 %. Over a period of 10 years we have investigated in our outpatient MS center the cognitive state of more than 400 MS patients for dementia according to the DSM IV classification and its correlation to MS. The main neuropsychological instrument was the Minimental Status Examination (MMSE). The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of our patients ranged from 0 (no signs, no disability) to 9 (bed ridden, helpless). In our data we classified 3 subtypes of dementia in MS (DMS). In DMS type 1 the cognitive decline is one of the main symptoms and develops early in the disease without marked motor symptoms. The DMS type 2 is associated with an malignant or chronic progressive course of MS itself. Therefore DMS type 2 developed in association with marked motor impairement later in the clinical course. In DMS type 1 and 2 a marked demyelination of the white matter and/or cortical involvement with brain atrophy, demonstrated by magnetic resonanz imaging is present. DMS type 3 is associated with older age with or without major motor disability. In these cases we found no clear correlation between the course and severity of MS and the dementia syndrome itself. In ptients with MS the development of dementia is very heterogenous. DMS type 1 and 2 are directly associated with the progression of the chronic autoimmune disease and the involvement of cortical and/or white matter structures. In DMS type 3 cases a comorbid condition with Alzheimer Dementia is discussed. It seems as DMS is not as rare as described in literature. Further epidemiologic studies are necessary to evaluate the incidence of DMS in a greater population",

Epilepsy patients identified with TBC1D24 compound heterozygous mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS) epilepsy panel or whole exome sequencing (WES) were enrolled. The enrolled patients were followed up to summarize the clinical features.ResultsNineteen patients were identified with TBC1D24 compound heterozygous mutations. Nine patients carried the same pathogenic variant c.241_252del. The seizure onset age ranged from 1 day to 8 months of age (median age 75 days). The most prominent features were multifocal myoclonus and epilepsia partialis continua (EPC). Myoclonus could be triggered by fever or infection in 15 patients, and could be terminated by sleep or sedation drugs. Psychomotor developmental delay was presented in 11 patients. Six patients exhibited hearing loss. Brain MRIs were abnormal in eight patients. Twelve patients were diagnosed with epilepsy syndromes including one patient who was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. Two patients died due to status epilepticus at 4 months and 19 months of age, respectively.ConclusionTBC1D24 mutation related epilepsy was drug-resistant. Multifocal myoclonus, EPC, and fever-induced seizures were common clinical features. Most patients presented psychomotor developmental delay. The neuroimaging abnormality and hearing loss could exacerbate during follow-up.",

In the chronic stage, many months or years after the initial infection, other neurologic complications may occur, such as encephalomyelitis, epileptic crises, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety, panick attacks, catatonia, psychosis etc. Some patient continue to experience symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or psychiatric disorder in the post borrelia syndrome. We describe here a patient with a triad of unusual symptoms in chronic LNB including tremor, seizures and psychosis. Standardized medical interview, neurologic examination, neuroimaging, serum and CSF serology as well as EEG and EMNG evaluation were performed. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and doxycycline and responded with rapid clinical and functional improvement. Newertheless, he suffered from multiple systemic and neurologic sequelas that influenced his daily activities in post treatment period. Emphasis is placed on the atypical onset and evolution, the difficulties encountered in formulating diagnosis, early treatment and the uncertainties concerning the sequelae after treatment.

Disorders to be included in the differential diagnosis are caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy, canine distemper virus meningoencephalomyelitis, other nervous system infections or inflammations and spinal cord neoplasia. All diagnostic tests including myelography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electrodiagnos‐tic testing and serum and cerebrospinal fluid titres for canine distemper virus are normal in NAD and LEM. There is no treatment for either disease and neurological signs progressively deteriorate. Eventually neurological deficits develop besides ataxia and these help differentiate NAD from LEM. Dogs with NAD develop head tremors and nystagmus while dogs with LEM develop conscious proprioceptive deficits and quadriparesis; the short term prognosis for NAD is better than LEM. Most dogs with LEM are euthanased because of non‐ambulatory tetraparesis within one year. The histopathological lesions associated with NAD include axonal spheroids in many spinal cord and caudal brainstem nuclei and reduced numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, while in LEM, multifocal areas of demyelination and malacia of the spinal cord and brainstem are the primary histopathological lesions. Both NAD and LEM are suspected to have an autosomal recessive genetic transmission.",

Кратко рассмотрены механизмы ЦА; приводятся данные о пирролах и пиролурии. Описаны основные неврологические и психиатрические проявления ЦА и пиролурии, а также подходы к их лечению.Отмечено, что имеются все основания полагать, что механизмы возникновения ЦА не имеют существенных отличий от таковых при формировании других аллергических реакций (при пищевой аллергии), основанных на двух основных типах иммунного ответа (сопряженных с избыточной выработкой IgE или с тучными клетками). Симптомы ЦА многочисленны и многообразны. Они зависят от возраста пациентов и могут манифестировать в чрезвычайно широких пределах. Спектр проявлений ЦА варьирует от приступов потери сознания и/или головных болей в сочетании с крапивницей, зудом и нарушениями зрения или транзиторных нарушений речи (афазия и т. д.) до одностороннего онемения конечностей и/или языка, сонливости, ступора, бессонницы, неспособности к концентрации, раздражительности, возбудимости, депрессии, тревожности, головокружения, мышечных проявлений. Проявления ЦА обычно находят выражение в форме конкретных психических нарушений (шизофрения, депрессия, галлюцинации, бред, кататония, эпилепсия, аутизм и т. д.).Указывается, что стандартных методов терапии для ЦА и пиролурии не разработано. Существующие подходы частично являются эмпирическими, а частично теоретически обоснованными. Обычно детям с церебральными проявлениями аллергии назначается гипоаллергенная (элиминационная) диета различной степени интенсивности. При необходимости такая диета может достигать уровня олигоантигенной.",

The neurological complications like encephalopathy or encephalitis or immune-mediated neurological syndromes are uncommon though. Discrete neuroimaging findings in this setting are even rarer. We report a case of dengue encephalitis with uncommon MRI features in a young female.The patient presented with complains of fever, vomiting, weakness in all limbs and difficulty in speech. Neurological examination revealed bilateral horizontal gaze palsy with impaired oculo-cephalic reflex, bulbar dysarthria and quadriplegia with bilateral planters up-going. Laboratory reported anemia, thrombocytopenia and positive NS1 antigen while excluding other tropical and immunological diseases. Brain MRI revealed extensive thalamic involvement as unique \"double-doughnut\" sign along with lesions in brainstem. The patient received supportive treatment in intensive unit and was discharged following improvement in clinical condition and laboratory reports.Dengue can infect the central nervous system directly as encephalitis or can have neurological consequences following multi-organ dysfunction and shock as encephalopathy or post-infection immunological syndromes as Guillain-Barré Syndrome or cerebrovascular complications or dengue muscle dysfunction. The MRI appearance of \"double-doughnut\" sign points towards dengue encephalitis in appropriate setting.A high index of suspicion is required to make a diagnosis of dengue encephalitis. The \"double-doughnut\" sign in MRI sequences has the potential to become a diagnostic marker for dengue encephalitis.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have shown no increased risk of epilepsy after mild head injury (i.e., brief loss of consciousness or amnesia). Twelve cases of newonset epilepsy occurring ⩽6 months after mild head injury were identified. None of the patients had other risk factors for epilepsy. There was no loss of consciousness in three cases; in the remaining nine, the duration of posttraumatic unconsciousness was ⩽10 min. Nine patients had epileptiform activity or video-EEG documented epileptic seizures; two other patients had focal slowing on the EEG. Eight patients have medically refractory epilepsy, probably reflecting the selection bias. These cases suggest that in certain instances mild head trauma may cause epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is an inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorder that usually presents as steroid responsive encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, or meningoencephalomyelitis. Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is an uncommon disorder that causes a localized or diffuse thickening of the dura mater. Depending on the etiology, HP can be idiopathic or secondary to a wide variety of other diseases. There are no reports of autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy presenting as HP. Methods In this case report, we describe a rare case of pediatric HP possibly associated with anti-GFAP antibody. Results A 13-year-old previously healthy girl presented with headache for nearly 8 months with left-sided peripheral facial palsy and left-sided abductor nerve palsy in the second month of course. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed contrast enhancement of hypertrophic dura mater. Anti-GFAPα antibodies were positive in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient improved clinically after steroid treatment with partial resolution of abnormal intracranial MRI lesions. Conclusion The present study suggests that HP may be one of the clinical phenotypes for autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy or GFAP antibody is a biomarker for HP.",

      "abstract": "Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and tendon areflexia, is generally considered as a clinical variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However some features of the disease are still debated, particularly regarding possible central nervous system involvement. After presenting two new cases of MFS, the authors provide a critical review of the literature and discuss the nosographical position of the disease. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: MFS is a predominantly axonal inflammatory neuropathy with prevailing involvement of oculomotor nerves. It is associated to spinal multi or polyneuropathy, which in mildly affected cases is manifested by areflexia, while in severe ones it can be responsible of sense and/or motor impairment. In addition to peripheral neuropathy CNS involvement, exclusive or more marked in posterior fossa, occurs not infrequently. The prognosis of the disease is often benign, but disabling or even fatal outcome is possible. Corticosteroid treatment, possibly because of antiinflammatory and/or immunosuppressive action, could be effective in some patients. Finally, in spite of some similarities with GBS, MFS should be considered as a separate entity with its own nosographical position.",

Peripheral neuropathies affect the cell body and the axon (neuropathy, axonopathy) or the myelin sheath (demyelinating neuropathy/neurapraxia). Neuropathies affect sensory, motor, autonomic nerves, or a combination. Pregnancy exacerbates some neuropathies, while pregnancy or parturition may be a direct or indirect cause of a variety of mononeuropathies and plexopathies.

Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

One-third of the patients have psychotic disorders, frequently followed by developmental regression and long-term cognitive disturbances. Despite humoral and cellular immunodeficiency are common in 22q11DS, it is associated with an increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, likely due to immune dysregulations associated with thymic abnormalities, which plays a major role in self-tolerance. We report an unique case of a 14-year-old girl with 22q11DS that presented with subacute psychotic symptoms, intolerance to antipsychotics, CSF pleocytosis, and EEG abnormalities, that was successfully treated with empiric immunotherapy after fulfilling criteria for probable seronegative autoimmune encephalitis and probable autoimmune psychosis. The autoimmune etiology of these clinical features of 22q11DS has never been postulated despite the predisposition of this syndrome to present autoimmune disorders. We suggest the systematic evaluation with serum and CSF neuronal antibodies, MRI, and EEG of patients with 22q11DS that develop subacute psychotic symptoms or rapidly progressive cognitive decline. Early immunomodulatory therapies should be carefully considered if criteria of probable autoimmune psychosis or possible autoimmune encephalitis are fulfilled, as it may prevent long-term disabilities. Further studies are required to assess the autoimmune origin of psychosis and cognitive impairment associated with 22q11DS.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics DCX-related disorders include the neuronal migration disorders: Classic thick lissencephaly (more severe anteriorly), usually in males Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), primarily in females Males with classic DCX-related lissencephaly typically have early and profound cognitive and language impairment, cerebral palsy, and epileptic seizures. The clinical phenotype in females with SBH varies widely with cognitive abilities that range from average or mild cognitive impairment to severe intellectual disability and language impairment. Seizures, which frequently are refractory to antiepileptic medication, may be either focal or generalized and behavioral problems may also be observed. In DCX-related lissencephaly and SBH the severity of the clinical manifestation correlates roughly with the degree of the underlying brain malformation as observed in cerebral imaging. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of a DCX-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a DCX pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Antiepileptic drugs for epileptic seizures; deep brain stimulation may improve the seizure disorder in individuals with SBH; special feeding strategies in newborns with poor suck; physical therapy to promote mobility and prevent contractures; special adaptive chairs or positioners as needed; occupational therapy to improve fine motor skills and oral-motor control; participation in speech therapy, educational training, and enrichment programs. Surveillance: Regular neurologic examination and monitoring of seizure activity, EEG, and antiepileptic drug levels; regular measurement of height, weight, and head circumference; evaluation of feeding and nutrition status; assessment of psychomotor, speech, and cognitive development; prompt consultation in the event of novel neurologic findings or deterioration, aspiration, or infections; monitoring for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity or scoliosis. Genetic counseling DCX-related disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Up to10% of unaffected mothers of children with a DCX pathogenic variant are presumed to have germline mosaicism with or without somatic mosaicism. A woman who is heterozygous for a DCX pathogenic variant has a 50% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Hemizygous male offspring usually manifest DCX-related classic lissencephaly, while heterozygous female offspring may be asymptomatic or more frequently manifest a wide phenotypic spectrum of SBH. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, testing to determine the genetic status of at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of residual cerebral dysfunction in the post-traumatic patient poses considerable problems particularly when the neurological examination yields minimal or equivocal findings. The clinical picture is frequently complicated by emotional disturbance not easily differentiated from \"post-traumatic neurosis.\" This report describes such a patient whose disorder was elicidated by neuropsychological testing. Numerous studies have established the validity of neuropsychological tests particularly when they are interpreted by psychologists specifically trained in their use. These procedures are also useful in differentiating patients with neurologic complaints of a nonorganic etiology from patients with similar complaints secondary to confirmed brain lesions. Although the findings reported here pertain to a patient exhibiting a rare neurologic consequence of closed head injury, the methods employed are applicable to subtle behavioral manifestations of diverse etiologies. Neurophyshological findings in a patient unable to recognize faces of familiar persons (prosopagnosia) disclosed a severe impairment of visual perception despite intact visual acuity and fields. The prosopagnosia was also associated with a pervasive memory deficit without dementia. Our results challenge current concepts of prosopagnosia and support the need for neuropsychological evaluation of post-traumatic patients.",

      "title": "547: CEREBRAL EDEMA IN MOG ANTIBODY DISEASE TREATED WITH INVASIVE MULTIMODAL NEUROMONITORING",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a neuroinflammatory disorder with a range of clinical phenotypes. MOGAD is typically steroid-responsive, with more refractory cases receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis. Invasive multimodal neuromonitoring provides real-time measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2) and may be accomplished via insertion of an intraparenchymal probe, also known as a “bolt”. It is becoming an important strategy in the management of patients with traumatic brain injury but is less well described in other acute neurological conditions associated with increased ICP. We describe a case of MOGAD in a child that presented as life-threatening cerebral edema, in which invasive multimodal neuromonitoring with ICP- and PbtO2-directed therapy was employed. This child ultimately survived with some persistent neurological deficits but with normal mood and affect and the ability to eat, drink, and ambulate independently. Description: A 7-year old boy presented with headaches, nausea and somnolence and was found to have increased ICP of unclear etiology. He then progressed to develop exam findings consistent with herniation. He received emergent medical therapies including hypertonic (3%) saline, hyperventilation, and sedation. A bolt was placed for invasive neuromonitoring, which guided treatment based on real-time measurements of ICP and PbtO2. Workup for the etiology of his severe cerebral edema revealed serum MOG antibodies. He received immunomodulatory therapies including steroids, plasmapheresis, and tocilizumab. He was discharged two months later with expressive and receptive aphasia and mild gait imbalance, but with recovered bowel and bladder continence, independent ambulation, and the ability to eat, drink, and interact socially with a normal mood and affect. Discussion: We describe a child who presented with cerebral edema and herniation due to MOGAD. He was managed with invasive multimodal neuromonitoring in addition to standard immunomodulatory treatments and had a favorable outcome. While further data is needed, invasive multimodal neuromonitoring may have utility as an adjunct to standard therapy in children with MOGAD and severe cerebral edema.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Neuroleptics can induce not only physical adverse effects but also mental effects that produce deficit status in thought, affect, cognition, and behavior. This condition is known as neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome (NIDS), which includes apathy, lack of initiative, anhedonia, indifference, blunted affect, and reduced insight into disease. Although this old concept now appears almost forgotten, neuroleptics, whether typical or atypical, can make depression or bipolar disorder resemble other more refractory conditions, readily leading to mistaken diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The authors describe three cases of NIDS superimposed on depressive phase in bipolar disorder with psychosis, where the attending psychiatrist’s failure to recognize NIDS prevented patients from receiving effective treatment and achieving remission. All cases achieved remission after reduction of neuroleptics and intensive therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy, for bipolar depression. The concept of NIDS was originally introduced for schizophrenia, and it has rarely been highlighted in other diseases. In recent years, however, atypical antipsychotics are being more often administered to patients with bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists, therefore, should also remember and exercise caution regarding NIDS in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder with and without psychosis. The authors believe that the concept of NIDS needs to be reappraised in current psychiatry.

      "title": "Characterization of Neuropathology and Neuroinflammatory Cascades after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Swine",
      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) often results in prolonged or permanent brain dysfunction with over 2.8 million affected annually in the U.S., including over 56,000 deaths, with over 5 million total survivors exhibiting chronic deficits. Mild TBI (also known as concussion) accounts for over 75% of all TBIs every year. Mild TBI is a heterogeneous disorder, and long-term outcomes are dependent on the type and severity of the initial physical event and compounded by secondary pathophysiological consequences such as neuroinflammation, reactive astrocytosis, edema, hypoxia, and excitotoxicity. Neuroinflammation has gained increasing attention for its role in secondary TBI injury as it can have both detrimental and beneficial roles. For example, microglia - the resident immune cell of the central nervous system (CNS) - mediate cell death and may contribute to progressive neurodegeneration but also aid in debris clearance and regeneration. However, prior to the following work microglia had not been studied after diffuse mild TBI in a clinically relevant large animal model at chronic time points. Replicating the injury biomechanics of human mild TBI in animal models presents a substantial challenge, particularly with regards to addressing brain size, neuroanatomy, and acceleration parameters. To address this challenge, our lab uses a swine model of diffuse closed-head TBI that accurately replicates human mild TBI mechanisms and manifestations due to the neuroanatomical similarities between humans and pigs (large gyrencephalic brains with high white to grey matter ratios) that are not present in small animals. This well-characterized model subjects the head to rapid angular acceleration, inducing inertial forces common in human TBI resulting from falls, collisions, or blunt impacts. This injury model has been shown to produce acute and chronic pathologies in patterns that mirror those seen in humans. Therefore, using this rotation-acceleration model of closed-head TBI in pigs, the goal of the studies reported herein was to elucidate the role of microglia and the neuroinflammatory response to single mild TBI out to 1 year post injury through in-depth histological profiling in discrete neuroanatomical regions across three specific aims. First, we assessed the relationship between the hallmark axonal pathology of diffuse TBI and alterations in glial cell activation or morphology. Then, we examined neuroinflammatory and synaptic changes in sub-regions of the dentate gyrus following a single mild TBI, as the hippocampus is notably susceptible to damage post-TBI and microglia may play a role in synaptic remodeling. Finally, we assessed gray matter neuropathology and neuroinflammation in response to a novel mechanism of immediate neuronal membrane disruption following TBI. These studies will inform future work to characterize the underlying molecular and neurophysiological alterations post-TBI, as well as potential contributions to neurological deficits. It is hoped that these aims will translate to advances in the treatment and prevention of the long-term consequences of TBI in people.",

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system of childhood is a reversible cause of severe neurological impairment, including acute ischemic stroke, intractable seizures, and cognitive decline. The first line therapy of CNS vasculitides is mainly based on corticosteroids and immunosuppressor drugs. Other strategies include plasmapheresis, immunoglobulins, and biologic drugs.

Immunologically, there are abnormalities in lymphocyte count and function, mainly NK-cells; elevated levels of certain cytokines and autoantibodies may be observed.

Overall, the most common form of CNS dysfunction is diffuse cerebral atrophy pathologically characterized by neuronal loss, glial nodules, and microfocal demyelination. Consequent neuropsychological deficits present an insidious course initially typified by poor memory and concentration, along with psychomotor retardation and blunted affect which resembles psychological depression. Gradually over several weeks to months, patients exhibit marked global cognitive impairment and can become severely disoriented and delusional.

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Sequelae of Dengue: A Review of the Interface",
      "abstract": "Dengue is one of the major public health concerns in tropical and subtropical countries. In addition to neurological sequelae which are well documented, emerging evidence suggests that dengue may also lead to psychiatric sequelae including mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety, and body dysmorphic disorder. This narrative review aims to synthesize the existing literature to explore the psychiatric manifestations and postulated pathophysiological mechanisms and identify predictors and treatment of psychiatric sequelae in dengue. This review identified 30 studies including observational studies, case reports, and case series. The immune‐inflammatory responses due to cytokine dysregulation, blood–brain barrier disruption, direct viral effects, and epigenetic mechanisms with histone deacetylase activation are possible contributors to psychiatric sequelae in dengue. The main predictors include severity of dengue, thrombocytopenia, central nervous system involvement, febrile and critical phase of illness, specific dengue virus serotypes (DENV‐2 and DENV‐3), and stress due to hospitalization. Psychiatric symptoms often persist beyond the acute phase, highlighting the importance of long‐term follow‐up to evaluate the impact of dengue on mental health. Additionally, comparisons with other Flaviviridae viruses, such as Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, reveal both shared and distinct psychiatric implications, suggesting potential virus‐specific mechanisms. The current treatment approaches are largely extrapolated from general psychiatric practice, with limited research on targeted interventions. Future research should focus on standardized diagnostic assessment, longitudinal follow‐up, diagnostic biomarkers, and developing targeted treatment strategies to improve clinical outcomes. With rising cases of dengue, integrating psychiatric screening into routine dengue management may enhance early recognition and intervention. Hence, a multidisciplinary research approach involving psychiatrists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, immunologists, and policymakers is crucial for addressing psychiatric sequelae in dengue fever and mitigating the detrimental implications on public health.",

Over the period of two years 51 patients were studied prospectively with this infestation, paying particular attention to the duration and severity of the illness, clinical course, CT findings and therapeutic modalities. Patients with parenchymal cysts or calcification without hydrocephalus had a benign disorder presenting commonly with seizures. This type of infestation usually is long-standing, almost never requires surgical treatment, responds to praziquantel therapy and has a good prognosis. In contrast, patients who present with hydrocephalus, large supratentorial cysts, multiple granulomata with cerebral oedema or with vasculitis and cerebral infarction, have an aggressive, acute or subacute illness, presenting with raised intracranial pressure, gait disturbances, mental changes, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, hemisphere syndromes, chronic meningitis and stroke. This malignant form usually requires surgical therapy, does not respond to praziquantel and may produce a fatal outcome or serious sequelae.",

      "title": "Topical Review: Encephalopathy Associated With Hashimoto Thyroiditis: Pediatric Perspective",
      "abstract": "In recent years, neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis have been increasingly recognized in both adult and pediatric patients. This neurologic complication has been termed “Hashimoto encephalopathy,” and it can begin abruptly, in the form of seizures or agitation, with or without other neurologic complaints, or it can develop gradually, in a relapsing-remiting manner, including, among others, cognitive deterioration and psychiatric illness. The occurrence of Hashimoto encephalopathy is unrelated to the patient's thyroid function status. Although the pathogenesis of this encephalopathy is not fully understood, evidence for both autoimmune and vasculitic mechanisms exists. Owing to a low index of suspicion, this encephalopathy is very likely underdiagnosed in children. The diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy is based on detecting antithyroid antibodies in these patients, although there is no correlation between antibody levels and the severity of the illness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging studies do not show consistent findings to support the diagnosis. Physicians' awareness of this complication is of great importance because most patients respond dramatically to corticosteroid therapy. Moreover, early recognition might also avoid an expensive diagnostic work-up in patients with unexplained encephalopathy ( J Child Neurol 2006;21:1—5).",

Brain death is the irreversible cessation of whole-brain function, which would be followed by the cessation of cardiopulmonary function without the institution of artificial measures. Recognition of the vegetative state (VS) entails a clinical diagnosis. The VS is likely to be permanent 12 months after traumatic brain injury and 3 months after nontraumatic injury in children. Minimally conscious state (MCS) is considered by some to be a neurological state whose recognition allows special legal and moral consideration. The interpretation of \"minimal\" becomes \"hardly different from vegetative\".",

The neurological manifestations of this pathology are infrequent, and may arise from direct invasion of neoplastic cells to the nervous system, or indirectly, through paraneoplastic syndromes or as a complication of treatment. Among the neurological paraneoplastic syndromes that affect patients with HL, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is the most common. Other few cases include limbic encephalitis, sensory, motor, and autonomic neuronopathy. These syndromes can be the initial manifestation of neoplastic disease, and the lack of information regarding this association can lead to a delay in diagnosis and consequently in the initiation of therapy worsening the prognosis. We report the case of awoman with HL who presented sensory and autonomic neuronopathy at the onset of her disease as paraneoplastic neurological manifestations. After the initiation of the specific treatment for the lymphoma, the autonomic neuronopathy had almost complete resolution, unlike the sensory neuronopathy, which showed limited recovery.El linfoma de Hodgkin (LH) comprende un grupo heterogéneo de neoplasias linfoides cuyo origen radica en linfocitos B.

      "abstract": "HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a common complication of HIV and remains highly prevalent even with modern HIV management strategies, causing debilitating pain in millions globally. We review HIV-SN diagnosis and management. We suggest most HIV-SN cases are easily recognized using clinical screening tools, with physician assessment and/or specialized testing prioritized for atypical cases. Management aims to prevent further nerve damage and optimize symptom control. Symptom relief is difficult and rarely complete, with a lack of proven pharmacological strategies. Work is needed to clarify optimal use of available medications. This includes understanding the marked placebo effect in HIV-SN analgesic trials and exploring 'responder phenotypes'. Limited data support nondrug strategies including hypnosis, meditation, psychology, physical activity and a positive therapeutic relationship.",

With the improvement in prehospital emergency systems, larger numbers of people are resuscitated from cardiac arrests, although with the increased prospect of neurological sequelae. Neurological impairment after cardiac arrest is dependent on the degree of brain damage suffered during the arrest. Although the duration and severity of brain ischemia is often difficult to determine, clinicians are often faced with difficult issues related to predicting outcome related to awakening and long-term neurological deficits after the arrest. Neurological impairments range from mild cognitive deficits to severe motor and cognitive deficits that preclude independence in many activities of daily living. Several neurological syndromes have been described in patients who awaken from hypoxic-ischemic coma with lasting motor and cognitive deficits. This review will address many of the common syndromes after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including persistent vegetative states, seizures, myoclonus, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and other neurological abnormalities.",

      "title": "The Enigma That Is ROHHAD Syndrome: Challenges and Future Strategies",
      "abstract": "Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare syndrome presenting in early childhood associated with a high risk of mortality between 50 and 60%. It is characterised by rapid, early onset of obesity between 1.5-7 years, along with central hypoventilation and hypothalamic dysfunction, such as central hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, disorders of sodium and water balance, growth hormone deficiency, adrenocortical insufficiency, or disorders of puberty and features of autonomic dysregulation. Up to half of cases have neural crest tumours, most commonly ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas. The incidence of ROHHAD syndrome in any population is unknown. Currently, there is no specific diagnostic or genetic biomarker for ROHHAD, and diagnosis is based on clinical signs and symptoms, which is often challenging, and consequently may be delayed or unrecognised. Early diagnosis is important, as without intervention, ROHHAD is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Aetiology remains unclear; an autoimmune origin has been postulated, with immunosuppressive agents being used with variable benefit. With no cure, multidisciplinary management is largely supportive. Therefore, there are many unanswered questions in ROHHAD syndrome. In this review article, we outline the challenges posed by ROHHAD syndrome, including aetiology, genetics, diagnosis, screening, management, and prognosis. We present research priorities to tackle these issues to improve outcomes.",

Recent studies suggest that these crises could be caused by an excess of pro-inflammatory molecules following a viral infection of the brain; however no evidence confirming this hypothesis has been demonstrated to date. Patients with NORSE are in the vast majority treated in intensive care units for several weeks or even months; despite the use of aggressive treatments such as therapeutic coma, and also immunotherapy, patients with NORSE face a high rate of complications and mortality; however a significant proportion of them eventually recover.

      "title": "Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the leading cause of death in comatose patients after cardiac arrest resuscitation. Poor neurological outcome is defined as death from neurological cause, persistent vegetative state, or severe neurological disability which is predicted in these patients by assessing the severity of HIE. Background: The most commonly used indicators of severe HIE include a bilateral absence of corneal and pupillary reflexes, bilateral absence of N2O waves of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials, high blood concentrations of neuron-specific enolase, unfavorable patterns on electroencephalogram, and signs of diffuse HIE on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Current guidelines recommend performing prognostication no earlier than 72 hours after return of spontaneous circulation in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain, after having excluded confounders such as residual sedation that may interfere with clinical examination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests are recommended so that the risk of a false prediction can be minimized. Materials: Neuroprognostication is vital and yet continues to be one of the most controversial topics in post-resuscitation care. Specifically, concerning HIE, the 2006 practice parameters of the American Academy of Neurology provide specific recommendations for the prognostication of neurologic outcomes for cardiac arrest survivors not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). To date, there is no adequate paradigm for prognostication in HIE treated with TH. Clinical examination including the presence or absence of brainstem reflexes, motor responses and absence of myoclonus were traditionally used to predict a favorable prognosis. Electrophysiologic testing in the form of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), the serum biomarker neuron-specific enolase (NSE), as well as neuroimaging, have been employed as additional tests to attempt to improve the predictive accuracy of neuroprognostication. However, what limited certainty these tests and parameters provided has become even more questionable in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia. The use of sedatives and analgesics adds a degree of uncertainty given unpredictable drug effects on patients’ neurologic status. EEG, SSEP are the most common electrophysiological modalities utilized in neuroprognostication. EEG has been evaluated in the prognostication of cardiac arrest survivors and has also led to some essential clinical discoveries. The 2006 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameters assign EEG a false-positive rate (FPR) of 3% with a CI of 0.9; making it the least predictive method to determine neurologic outcomes. Abend et al., pooled four existing studies on EEG in cardiac arrest (CA) patients who had undergone therapeutic hypothermia and found that 29% of these patients had acute electrographic non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Conclusion: There is no good evidence from well-designed studies to support substantial accuracy of early prognostication ( &lt; 72 hours post-arrest) in cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Given our lack of understanding of how therapeutic hypothermia improves outcomes, as well as its effects on emergence from the coma and its well-described effects in altering drug metabolism and clearance, it is prudent to be more conservative in approaching prognostication. Patients should be observed for a minimum of 72 hours post-arrest. However, 5-7 or more days of observation may be necessary to fully account for the effects of therapeutic hypothermia.",

PANS incluye síntomas como el inicio abrupto de Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo (TOC) y otros síntomas neuropsiquiátricos graves. Presentación del caso: Se describe el caso de un adolescente de 15 años con leucemia linfoblástica aguda de células B, que tras recibir tratamiento quimioterápico, desarrolla un cuadro neuropsiquiátrico complejo. El paciente presentó síntomas como hiporexia, elevación de bilirrubina y enzimas hepáticas, junto con síntomas obsesivo-compulsivos, ansiedad, irritabilidad y clínica psicótica. Tras la administración de diversos tratamientos, incluyendo antibióticos, antivirales y psicofármacos, se observó una mejoría significativa en los síntomas neuropsiquiátricos y hepáticos. Discusión: El caso plantea un desafío diagnóstico, ya que la sintomatología presentada podría ser compatible con varias condiciones, incluyendo encefalitis límbica y otros trastornos neuropsiquiátricos. Se descartaron infecciones virales y alteraciones autoinmunes mediante estudios específicos, sugiriendo que los síntomas neuropsiquiátricos podrían estar relacionados con una respuesta autoinmune o inflamatoria en el contexto del tratamiento quimioterápico. Conclusiones: Este caso destaca la importancia de un enfoque multidisciplinario para el diagnóstico y manejo de PANS, subrayando la necesidad de descartar otros trastornos antes de llegar a un diagnóstico definitivo. La evolución positiva del paciente tras un tratamiento dirigido respalda la hipótesis de una etiología autoinmune o inflamatoria subyacente.",

      "title": "Mortality Determinants in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury with Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is defined as an acute brain injury caused by mechanical forces to the head, excluding those related to drugs, alcohol, medications, or other conditions, such as systemic injuries, psychological trauma, or coexisting medical issues. TBI is a global public health issue responsible for significant disability and mortality, with an estimated global incidence of 69 to over 100 million new cases annually. This burden may be higher due to underreporting, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Several methods have been established to classify TBI, one of them is based on its severity with the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Pneumonia is a frequent complication in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, especially those on prolonged mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia could be classified based on the source of infection into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Objective: To evaluate the mortality and risk factors of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) with pneumonia. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study with observational analytical investigations. The sample of this study is sTBI patients who were treated in Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital in 2023. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the patients' characteristics. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to find relationship between factors that increase the risk of death and the development of pneumonia. Results: In 2023, we documented 832 TBI cases, of these, 479 cases (57.6%) were mild TBI, 273 cases (32.8%) were moderate brain injuries, while severe brain injuries (sTBI) with 80 cases (9.6%). Our study shows that 50% of patients with sTBI have pneumonia, and VAP itself is one of the contributing factors to mortality in this population (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Of all types of pneumonia in this study, there is a statistical correlation between mortality and VAP in sTBI patients.",

      "title": "When Sick Brain and Hopelessness Meet: Some Aspects of Suicidality in the Neurological Patient",
      "abstract": ": Neurological diseases expose individuals to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, including completed suicides and suicide attempts. They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

      "abstract": "Lissencephaly is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. It is characterized by a cerebral malformation due to deficient neuronal migration, which occurs between the 12th and 16th weeks of gestation. This deficient migration can generate changes in the cerebral parenchyma like agyria, pachigyria or heterotopic band. Due to the difficulty of clinical suspicion, it is essential to perform diagnostic imaging tests. It is a pathology with a poor prognosis that requires strict monitoring with a multidisciplinary team. It may be associated with West Syndrome (SW), which is characterized as an epileptic encephalopathy based on a triad: epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG) and developmental arrest or psychomotor delay. The highest incidence is in males and between 3 and 12 months, being more common in the first two years of life. This syndrome is epileptogenic and can be etiologically classified as cryptogenic and symptomatic, the latter has a structural cause in the central nervous system, such as lissencephaly. The diagnosis of SW is made by the union between clinical characteristics, electroencephalographic findings (EEG) and imaging tests. Treatment, due to the difficult control of seizures, is usually done with combination of multiple antiepileptics. The case described here reports the clinical evolution of a pediatric patient with lissencephaly associated with West syndrome, highlighting the main milestones of his clinical evolution until diagnosis.",

This chapter describes and illustrates the clinical syndromes and the neuropathological basis for the syndromes in a wide range of systemic acquired metabolic diseases. Systemic cardiorespiratory disease is commonly associated with hypoxic and ischemic injuries of the nervous system, either from arrest of flow (ischemia) or from hypoxic and hypoperfusion syndromes. These are associated with specific neuropathologic changes, with certain hypoxic–ischemic injuries associated with specific systemic cardiorespiratory changes. Hypoglycemia, hyperthermia, serum electrolytes disturbances, vitamin deficiencies, and exogenous intoxications, particularly alcoholism and intoxications by drugs, methanol, and heavy metals, are all discussed along with their specific neuropathologic changes. Hepatic encephalopathy, multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, and paraneoplastic encephalomyelopathies are discussed and illustrated, including the recently defined paraneoplastic syndromes and serum immunoglobulin markers.",

      "title": "Cognitive and emotional impairment in patients with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency",
      "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease is one of the most important problems of clinical neurology, which is a significant cause of cognitive impairment and depression. Chronic forms of cerebrovascular insufficiency are most often associated with cerebral microangiopathy or a disease of small vessels, which is characterized by the presence of lacunae, microinfarction and microbleeding, leukoaraiosis and dilated perivascular spaces. One of the main and most common clinical symptoms is vascular cognitive impairment. They are characterized by extremely variable cognitive deficits, highly dependent on the location and severity of vascular damage. However, clinical manifestations associated with impaired frontal circulation are usually observed. Recent international criteria for vascular cognitive impairment presented by the VASCOG (International Society for Vascular Behavioral and Cognitive Disorders) working group emphasize the particular importance of impaired information processing speed, attention, and/or frontal regulatory functions, often in combination with personality or emotional disorders. The frequency of vascular depression in chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency reaches 70%. The addition of affective disorders significantly aggravates the existing cognitive deficit, increases the risk of dementia. This is due to the fact that depression itself leads to the development of cognitive impairment, causes multiple functional disorders of cerebral microcirculation and a number of other mechanisms. The presence of cerebral microangiopathy underlying this pathology makes the use of drugs with vascular effects in the treatment of these patients. The use of preparations with multimodal action, in particular the combined drug and, is most preferable.",

      "abstract": "Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv amyloidosis) is predominantly a disease of the peripheral nerves, heart, kidney, and eye. CNS involvement has been a marginal issue in research and the clinical setting until recently. Growing evidence shows that leptomeningeal amyloid accumulation is frequent and present from early stages of ATTRv amyloidosis. Several recent studies show CNS symptoms arise as a common late complication in patients with the V30M mutation after at least 14 years of symptomatic peripheral nerve disease. Conversely, in non-V30M patients, there are several descriptions, mostly case reports, of patients presenting with severe phenotypes of ocular and CNS dysfunction (oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis), with little systemic involvement. This phenotype is found in rare families worldwide, associated with at least 14 mutations. In both patients with late and early onset CNS dysfunction, symptoms include transient focal neurologic episodes, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, cognitive decline, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Pathologically, there is severe amyloid deposition in the leptomeninges and cerebral amyloid angiopathy of leptomeningeal and penetrating vessels. These amyloid aggregates are formed mostly by CSF-produced transthyretin (TTR) and seem resistant to the available ATTRv therapies that increase the stability or reduce the production of plasma TTR. This indicates that CNS involvement will become a meaningful issue in patient management in upcoming years.",

      "title": "Neuroprotective Effects of Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Induced by Repetitive Head Collisions: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "The repeated head impacts experienced by athletes have attracted significant interest from both the public and the scientific community; however, the neurobiological effects following the games are not well understood. For example, a single football match carries the risk of repeated concussive and subconcussive head impacts, which can increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is one of the neurodegenerative conditions athletes often face or are unaware of. However, addressing the disease progression in CTE is difficult to determine due to several reasons, such as the failure to identify risk factors, difficulty in differentiating CTE from other neurodegenerative diseases, and the lack of a specific mechanism by which CTE leads to tau protein accumulation. In addition, CTE symptoms overlap with other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), which poses a challenge to producing specific targeted therapy. In this case, ultrasound represents a promising non-invasive technique that enables clear visualization of brain structures and may modulate neuronal activity. The term ultrasound encompasses various modalities; for example, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) employs thermal energy to ablate cells, whereas low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) delivers mechanical energy that activates molecular signaling pathways to impede the progression of CTE. Therefore, the LIPUS application could potentially minimize the risk of damage in the surrounding tissues of the brain and reduce the disease progression in individuals with CTE. Nevertheless, limited studies have been reported in the literature, with a poor mechanistic approach. Hence, this review aims to highlight the molecular signaling pathways, such as AKT, MAPK, and ERK, affected by LIPUS and emphasize the need for additional research to clarify its mechanistic effects in CTE management. Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of LIPUS as a therapeutic strategy in addressing the complexities of CTE and its associated neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Physio-Cognitive Decline Syndrome as the Phenotype and Treatment Target of Unhealthy Aging",
      "abstract": "In this era of unprecedented longevity, healthy aging is an important public health priority. Avoiding or shortening the period of disability or dementia before death is critical to achieving the defining objectives of healthy aging, namely to develop and maintain functional capabilities that enable wellbeing in older age. The first step is to identify people who are at risk and then to implement effective primary interventions. Geriatricians have identified a distinct clinical phenotype of concurrent physical frailty and cognitive impairment, which predicts high risk of incident dementia and disability and is potentially reversible. Differing operational definitions for this phenotype include \"cognitive frailty\", \"motoric cognitive risk syndrome\" and the recently proposed \"physio-cognitive decline syndrome (PCDS)\". PCDS is defined as concurrent mobility impairment no disability (MIND: slow gait or/and weak handgrip) and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND: ≥1.5 SD below the mean for age-, sex-, and education-matched norms in any cognitive domain but without dementia). By these criteria, PCDS has a prevalence of 10-15% among community-dwelling older persons without dementia or disability, who are at increased risk for incident disability (HR 3.9, 95% CI 3.0-5.1), incident dementia (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.4-5.0) and all-cause mortality (HR 6.7, 95% CI 1.8-26.1). Moreover, PCDS is associated with characteristic neuroanatomic changes in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and their neurocircuitry, which are distinct from neuroimaging features in normal aging and common dementia syndromes. Basic research and longitudinal clinical studies also implicate a hypothetical muscle-brain axis in the pathoetiology of PCDS. Most important, community-dwelling elders with PCDS who participated in a multidomain intervention had significant improvements in global cognitive function, and especially in the subdomains of naming and concentration. Our proposed operational definition of PCDS successfully identifies an appreciable population of at-risk older people, establishes a distinct phenotype with an apparently unique pathoetiology, and is potentially reversible. We now need further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of PCDS, to validate neuroimaging features and muscle-secreted microRNA biomarkers, and to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained multidomain interventions.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background and Aims</h3> Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by high levels of autoantibodies and multi-organ tissue damage including damage of the central system. Nerve system disease in SLE includes neurologic and psychiatric events, collectively termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). Currently, the pathogenesis of NPSLE is unclear. We investigated pathogenesis of NPSLE in this study. <h3>Methods</h3> To understand the pathogenesis of NPSLE, we analysed the medical records of 1131 patients with SLE, and conducted experiments by using lupus-prone mice and mice with intracisternal injections of lupus serum containing high level of autoantibody and mice with gene deficiency. <h3>Results</h3> There are 59 patients with NPSLE clinical manifestation including headaches, seizure disorder, cognitive dysfunction, cerebrovascular disease, etc. MRI examination in 14 patients with NPSLE indicates 50% normal and 50% abnormal signals. Lupus-prone mice spontaneously develop meningitis. Meningitis was developed in normal mice with intracisternal injection of lupus serum but not healthy serum; IgG is a major contributor in this meningitis. Monocyte/macrophage, complement and selectin are involved in the development of meningitis induced by lupus serum. This meningitis is dependent on dose of IgG but not associated with kinds of autoantibodies and systemic disease activity. Severity of meningitis induced by lupus serum IgG was significantly reduced in TNF deficient mice compared to wild mice. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The deposited IgG or IgG contained immune complex in brain tissue exerts an important role in the pathogenesis of meningitis. This finding will promote development of effective therapeutic strategy to patients with NPSLE.",

      "title": "Management of Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Current Approaches and Future Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a generic definition referring to a series of neurological and psychiatric symptoms directly related to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). NPSLE includes heterogeneous and rare neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. Due to the lack of a gold standard, the attribution of NP symptoms to SLE represents a clinical challenge that obligates the strict exclusion of any other potential cause. In the acute setting, management of these patients does not differ from other non-SLE subjects presenting with the same NP manifestation. Afterwards, an individualized therapeutic strategy, depending on the presenting manifestation and severity of symptoms, must be started. Clinical trials in NPSLE are scarce and most of the data are extracted from case series and case reports. High-dose glucocorticoids and intravenous cyclophosphamide remain the cornerstone for patients with severe symptoms that are thought to reflect inflammation or an underlying autoimmune process. Rituximab, intravenous immunoglobulins, or plasmapheresis may be used if response is not achieved. When patients present with mild to moderate NP manifestations, or when maintenance therapy is warranted, azathioprine and mycophenolate may be considered. When symptoms are thought to reflect a thrombotic underlying process, anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are the mainstay of therapy, especially if antiphospholipid antibodies or antiphospholipid syndrome are present. Recent trials on SLE using new biologicals, based on newly understood SLE mechanisms, have shown promising results. Based on what we currently know about its pathogenesis, it is tempting to speculate how these new therapies may affect the management of NPSLE patients. This article provides a comprehensive and critical review of the literature on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of NPSLE. We describe the most common pharmacological treatments used in NPSLE, based on both a literature search and our expert opinion. The extent to which new drugs in the advanced development of SLE, or the blockade of new targets, may impact future treatment of NPSLE will also be discussed.",

Most patients respond well to standard medical management for Graves' disease, although there exists a small subset of people who do not. There are few cases describing patients with psychosis without underlying psychiatric disorders who require intensive care admission and thyroidectomy for necessary management of refractory psychosis secondary to thyrotoxicosis.

      "abstract": "Brain injury in the perinatal period occurs in many clinical settings, e.g. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in term infants, neonatal stroke, encephalopathy of prematurity, and infections. These insults often result in life-long disabilities including cerebral palsy, cognitive deficits, visual dysfunction, hearing impairments, and epilepsy. However, the success of clinical implementation of a broad array of potential neuroprotective strategies tested experimentally has been limited with the exception of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) used within hours of birth in term human babies with mild to moderate HIE. There is an extensive search for adjuvant therapeutic approaches to enhance the outcomes. One strategy is to modify susceptibility in the developing CNS by means of preconditioning or postconditioning using sublethal stress. The pre-clinical and clinical literature has shown that CNS immaturity at the time of ischemic insult plays a central role in the response to injury. Thus, better understanding of the molecular regulation of the endogenous vulnerability of the immature brain is needed. Further, the use of sublethal stressors of different origin may help shed light on mechanistic similarities and distinctions beween conditioning strategies. In this review we discuss the mechanisms of protection that are achieved by an interplay of changes on the systemic level and brain level, and via changes of intracellular and mitochondrial signaling. We also discuss the barriers to improving our understanding of how brain immaturity and the type of insult-hypoxic, ischemic or inflammatory-affect the efficacy of conditioning efforts in the immature brain.",

      "abstract": "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) or Ondine's curse is a very rare sleep disorder that is the result of a congenital failure of the autonomic control of ventilation caused by insensitivity of the chemoreceptor to hypercapnea during sleep. Gastrointestinal motility disorders, particularly a congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung disease) is often combined with CCHS. This combination can be explained by a defect in the migration of neuronal cells from the neural crest (neurocristopathy) during the intrauterine period. A diagnosis of CCHS is made by confirming the failure of adequate ventilation in response to hypercapnea and hypoxia during sleep and the exclusion of other diseases. Young infants frequently show atypical clinical courses, and their conditions are frequently complicated with the long-term sequela of hypoxemic episodes. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and active treatment with mechanical ventilation are important for reducing recurrent hypoxemic episodes in the neonatal period. This paper reports the follow up of a case of CCHS in a neonate who showed frequent intractable apnea and cyanosis and was given artificial mechanical ventilation during sleep.",

      "title": "A RARE CASE OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY WITH CONCURRENT ABDOMINAL TUBERCULOSIS",
      "abstract": "Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare, immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by progressive or relapsing motor and sensory dysfunction due to peripheral nerve demyelination. CIDP can be associated with autoimmune conditions, infections, or vaccines. The coexistence of CIDPwith abdominal tuberculosis (TB) is extremely uncommon and poses a diagnostic challenge due to overlapping symptoms with more common diseases and neuropathies. We report the case of a 17-year-old female with a history of abdominal TB who presented with progressive bilateral lower limb weakness and difficulty walking for one month. Neurological evaluation revealed decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower limbs, diminished deep tendon reflexes, but preserved superficial and cortical sensations. Nerve conduction studies and MRI supported the diagnosis of CIDP. Differential diagnoses including diabetic neuropathy, Guillain-Barré Syndrome, paraneoplastic neuropathy, and hereditary motor-sensory neuropathies were considered and excluded based on clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed elevated protein without pleocytosis, further supporting CIDP. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin therapy, resulting in clinical improvement. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing CIDPin patients with atypical presentations, especially when coexisting with infections like abdominal TB. Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment, worsening outcomes. Acomprehensive diagnostic approach including clinical examination, electrophysiological studies, CSF analysis, and imaging is essential to distinguish CIDP from other demyelinating neuropathies. Early recognition and timely initiation of immunomodulatory treatment are crucial to prevent complications and improve prognosis. Our report adds to the limited literature on CIDP with abdominal TB and also highlights the need for increased clinical awareness of this rare but treatable neurological condition.",

      "abstract": "Transient and hardly traceable signs of diminished consciousness might be the only signs that are apparent and reported during the scrutinous care of intensive care unit (ICU) staff. Unfortunately, most transient loss of consciousness (TLoC) episodes occur elsewhere. This review aims to help recognize TLoC and identify situations when these conditions mean that certain legal privileges should be held. With this aim, the current literature was scoped for conceptualizing consciousness, its alterations, and loss as regarded in the legal system. This review was partly inceptive for increasing the use of unconsciousness as a defense against criminal charges. This paper tackles working ability and the legal liability of individuals suffering from TLoC. What has been most discussed is so-called syncope—a TLoC without actual focal neurological deficit which occurs due to hypoperfusion of the brain. Therefore, it is a symptom of the nervous system indicating a cardiovascular condition. Unlike stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), hypoperfusion affects the entire brain. The sudden loss of consciousness in everyday workplace situations can lead to dangerous situations. Likewise, as a result of avoiding these situations, being aware of the possible loss of consciousness can preclude a patient from performing the duties of occupation—or any activity.",

In cases of NORSE in which an etiology is found, antibody-mediated disorders are the most common cause.

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy in the late preterm and term infant is an important clinical condition because it can be associated with death or poor neurodevelopment in early childhood. Stages of encephalopathy (mild, moderate, and severe) soon after birth have value in predicting outcome during early infancy and even at early school-age. Prompt recognition after birth of the subset of infants in whom encephalopathy is associated with hypoxia-ischemia (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [HIE]) is critical because the outcome is potentially modifiable with therapeutic hypothermia. A series of large randomized clinical trials have provided better estimates of the outcomes of moderate and severe HIE compared with the era before the hypothermia trials. Therapeutic hypothermia reduces the composite outcome of death or a major disability at 18 months to 2 years of age among term infants who have moderate or severe encephalopathy. School-age follow-up of a limited number of infants from these trials indicates that death is reduced without any evidence that the percentage of brain-injured infants is increased. Practitioners need to be aware, however, that poor outcomes among infants who have HIE who have received hypothermia treatment is common, and many gaps persist regarding the outcome of these infants at school-age and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) syndromes are a group of genetically defined diseases characterized by the association of red blood cell acanthocytosis and progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia. NA syndromes are exceptionally rare with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 to 5 per 1'000'000 inhabitants for each disorder. The core NA syndromes include autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis and X-linked McLeod syndrome which have a Huntington's disease-like phenotype consisting of a choreatic movement disorder, psychiatric manifestations and cognitive decline, and additional multi-system features including myopathy and axonal neuropathy. In addition, cardiomyopathy may occur in McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes are also found in a proportion of patients with autosomal dominant Huntington's disease-like 2, autosomal recessive pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration and several inherited disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, namely abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) and hypobetalipoproteinemia leading to vitamin E malabsorption. The latter disorders are characterized by a peripheral neuropathy and sensory ataxia due to dorsal column degeneration, but movement disorders and cognitive impairment are not present. NA syndromes are caused by disease-specific genetic mutations. The mechanism by which these mutations cause neurodegeneration is not known. The association of the acanthocytic membrane abnormality with selective degeneration of the basal ganglia, however, suggests a common pathogenetic pathway. Laboratory tests include blood smears to detect acanthocytosis and determination of serum creatine kinase. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging may demonstrate striatal atrophy. Kell and Kx blood group antigens are reduced or absent in McLeod syndrome. Western blot for chorein demonstrates absence of this protein in red blood cells of chorea-acanthocytosis patients. Specific genetic testing is possible in all NA syndromes. Differential diagnoses include Huntington disease and other causes of progressive hyperkinetic movement disorders. There are no curative therapies for NA syndromes. Regular cardiologic studies and avoidance of transfusion complications are mandatory in McLeod syndrome. The hyperkinetic movement disorder may be treated as in Huntington disease. Other symptoms including psychiatric manifestations should be managed in a symptom-oriented manner. NA syndromes have a relentlessly progressive course usually over two to three decades.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) (previously frontal lobe epilepsy) is a rare seizure disorder commonly misdiagnosed or unrecognized, causing negative patient sequelae. While usually reported in familial studies, it is more commonly acquired. Diagnosis is a challenge due to its low incidence in comparison with the more common sleep disorders or psychogenic etiologies in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is scaled on degree of certainty based on described or clinically documented semiology, with video EEG as a helpful, but not necessary, adjunct. Current treatment is similar to other focal epilepsies. We studied a 36-year-old active duty male soldier who presented with 2 years of predominantly sleep related, abrupt, short, and anamnestic hyperkinetic movements with unstructured vocalizations. Prior workup included non-contributory video electroencephalograph (EEG) and polysomnography as well as normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatments for presumed psychiatric and parasomnia disturbances were not effective in establishing diagnosis or relief. Evaluation at our tertiary, multidisciplinary care institution recorded events consistent with the diagnosis of clinical SHE. He was enrolled in an advanced multishell diffusion-weighted imaging MRI research study to evaluate white matter tracts, given his history of mild, repetitive, non-penetrating traumatic brain injury, not otherwise requiring hospitalization. Multishell diffusion MRI tractography found changes not previously described in the right frontal lobe white matter tracts. These changes were consistent with neurological localization and serve as a potential nidus for this patient's seizure disorder. Misdiagnosis of SHE can result in detrimental biopsychosocial sequelae of untreated epilepsy, unnecessary or harmful intervention, or the stigmata of a behavioral disorder. Further investigation into diagnosis and etiology of acquired SHE is needed. Assessment for white matter abnormalities can potentially provide information into pathogenesis of epilepsy disorders.",

      "title": "Critical Illness Weakness, Polyneuropathy and Myopathy: Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term outcomes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Severe weakness associated with critical illness (CIW) is common. This narrative review summarizes the latest scientific insights and proposes a guide for clinicians to optimize the diagnosis and management of the CIW during the various stages of the disease from the ICU to the community stage. Main body CIW arises as diffuse, symmetrical weakness after ICU admission, which is an important differentiating factor from other diseases causing non-symmetrical muscle weakness or paralysis. In patients with adequate cognitive function, CIW can be easily diagnosed at the bedside using manual muscle testing, which should be routinely conducted until ICU discharge. In patients with delirium or coma or those with prolonged, severe weakness, specific neurophysiological investigations and, in selected cases, muscle biopsy are recommended. With these exams, CIW can be differentiated into critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy, which often coexist. On the general ward, CIW is seen in patients with prolonged previous ICU treatment, or in those developing a new sepsis. Respiratory muscle weakness can cause neuromuscular respiratory failure, which needs prompt recognition and rapid treatment to avoid life-threatening situations. Active rehabilitation should be reassessed and tailored to the new patient’s condition to reduce the risk of disease progression. CIW is associated with long-term physical, cognitive and mental impairments, which emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary model of care. Follow-up clinics for patients surviving critical illness may serve this purpose by providing direct clinical support to patients, managing referrals to other specialists and general practitioners, and serving as a platform for research to describe the natural history of post-intensive care syndrome and to identify new therapeutic interventions. This surveillance should include an assessment of the activities of daily living, mood, and functional mobility. Finally, nutritional status should be longitudinally assessed in all ICU survivors and incorporated into a patient-centered nutritional approach guided by a dietician. Conclusions Early ICU mobilization combined with the best evidence-based ICU practices can effectively reduce short-term weakness. Multi-professional collaborations are needed to guarantee a multi-dimensional evaluation and unitary community care programs for survivors of critical illnesses.",

      "title": "Diabetic Proximal Neuropathy: Therapy and Prognosis",
      "abstract": "Diabetic proximal neuropathy goes by a bewildering variety of names: diabetic femoral neuropathy, amyotrophy, neuropathic cachexia, anterior neuronopathy, polyradiculopathy, myopathy, mononeuritis multiplex or lumbar plexopathy. We are all familiar with the typical syndrome in elderly in Type 2 diabetics who develop severe unilateral anterior thigh pain followed by wasting and weakness of the quadriceps muscle with loss of the knee jerk [1]. This soon becomes bilateral in roughly 50 per cent of patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been identified. It is presumed that peripheral nerve infarcts are responsible for those cases which develop acutely over a few days. However, an earlier report of small peripheral nerve infarcts in an autopsy study [2] has been tempered by subsequent recognition that such lesions can be difficult to distinguish from Renaut bodies, a non-specific histopathological finding [3]. Furthermore, any theory that proximal diabetic neuropathy represents nerve infarction due to diabetic microvascular disease would have to account for the rarity with which it is accompanied by diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy, [4] the excellent recovery achieved by many patients, and the marked tendency for abnormalities to develop symmetrically on the two sides within a few weeks of one another [4, 5]. The other end of the clinical spectrum is less well recognized: symmetrical proximal muscle weakness of slow onset, which is relatively painless and is presumed to be metabolic in origin [6-8]. A paper in this issue of the journal by Coppack and Watkins [5] addresses two important issues concerning the treatment and prognosis of diabetic proximal neuropathy. First, does hypoglycaemic therapy really aid recovery of the leg weakness? Second, to what extent do these patients ultimately recover from disability which may be seriously incapacitating for many months? There is no doubt that many patients with diabetic proximal neuropathy do recover. Few physicians can resist the temptation to improve glycaemic control in patients who develop diabetic proximal neuropathy and most feel this action is responsible for recovery when it occurs. But is hypoglycaemic therapy itself really responsible for recovery, or is recovery merely part of the natural history of diabetic proximal neuropathy? Garland [9] stated that 'the only treatment necessary is full diabetic control. . . the use of insulins is almost invariably essential' a view supported by Casey and Harrison [10]. However it is clear that diabetic proximal neuropathy can develop in patients with rather mild glucose intolerance, and that recovery can coincide merely with the institution of a low calorie diet, without additional hypoglycaemic medication [7, 10].",

Pregnancy and childbirth proceeded without features and the early stages of cognitive-motor development were marked as normative, with the exception of a single epileptic seizure at the age of 3 years (according to the description of the parents). Until the age of 16, the patient was not under the supervision of a neurologist or psychiatrist, developed on a par with his peers, successfully attended school with high marks in the exact sciences, and went in for sports. Methods Case report Results Case report Conclusions A patient is considered with a non-standard course of psychosis and epilepsy, which was accompanied by multiple neurological and psychiatric symptoms.In Israel there are only 13 patients with a resemble clinical picture and there is no diagnosis or group of diagnoses in ICD, DSM or any neulogical classificatin tha can describe his disease.",

      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo. Conclusion. El tratamiento de los ninos en los que coexiste un trastorno del neurodesarrollo con la epilepsia es un problema dificil que requiere un planteamiento multidisciplinario que aborde tanto la epilepsia como el problema especifico cognitivo o conductual y que se adapte a las necesidades de cada nino.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

Research regarding the potential treatment of MCI is reviewed. Current research suggests that neurocognitive decline associated with MCI that may evolve into a dementia syndrome is potentially managed by treating cardiovascular risk factors, appropriate diet and physical exercise, challenging mental activity, intervention for any neuropsychiatric issues, and encouraging meaningful psychosocial relationships. Recent research also suggests potentially better effect on neuropsychological functioning when medication such as donepezil is used to manage both dementia and MCI.",

      "abstract": "Lissencephaly is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. It is characterized by a cerebral malformation due to deficient neuronal migration, which occurs between the 12th and 16th weeks of gestation. This deficient migration can generate changes in the cerebral parenchyma like agyria, pachigyria or heterotopic band. Due to the difficulty of clinical suspicion, it is essential to perform diagnostic imaging tests. It is a pathology with a poor prognosis that requires strict monitoring with a multidisciplinary team. It may be associated with West Syndrome (SW), which is characterized as an epileptic encephalopathy based on a triad: epileptic spasms, hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG) and developmental arrest or psychomotor delay. The highest incidence is in males and between 3 and 12 months, being more common in the first two years of life. This syndrome is epileptogenic and can be etiologically classified as cryptogenic and symptomatic, the latter has a structural cause in the central nervous system, such as lissencephaly. The diagnosis of SW is made by the union between clinical characteristics, electroencephalographic findings (EEG) and imaging tests. Treatment, due to the difficult control of seizures, is usually done with combination of multiple antiepileptics. The case described here reports the clinical evolution of a pediatric patient with lissencephaly associated with West syndrome, highlighting the main milestones of his clinical evolution until diagnosis.",

This case report presents a young patient initially diagnosed with hemiplegic migraine, having a normal brain CT, with focal cerebral perfusion mismatch not restricted to a single vascular territory on CT angiography. Brain MRI revealed a cytotoxic lesion of the splenium in the corpus callosum (CLOCC), a feature also reported in migraine. However, recurrent headaches with neurological deficits prompted further investigations with CSF analysis and brain MRI, confirming HaNDL and demonstrating reversibility of CLOCC. Recognising HaNDL as a differential diagnosis is essential in patients with recurrent headaches with focal neurological deficits, given the differences in therapeutic approach. The relationship between migraine and HaNDL is not fully understood, but they may share a pathophysiological link. Awareness of this is crucial for accurate diagnosis.",

As well as in other organic psychosyndromes hallucinations and confabulations can be present in the same time deficits of attention, emotions, psychomotor behavior, memory, or inversion of sleep wake cycle, which can lead to hepatic coma. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy behavior disturbances are usually present, therefore are treated with tranquillizers, especially benzodiazepine anxiolitycs which could precipitate cerebral dysfunction. It is of importance to stress that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are highly susceptible to exogenous and endogenous benzodiazepines, which Is one of the factors of disability of neurotransmission balance. Therefore use of benzodiazepines with long half life in plasma and active metabolites, is contraindicated in the patients with, liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, because of the possibility of progression toward hepatic coma. On the basis of gabaergic hypothesis of pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine antagonists could be useful in the treatment.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune condition caused by antibodies against the post-synaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junction, leading to fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles. Bulbar symptoms are less prevalent than ocular symptoms or limb weakness but can be particularly morbid. Non-neurologists are more likely to be the first providers to evaluate patients with dysphagia and should be familiar with MG.

It is remarkable that an immune-mediated encephalitis triggered by a confirmed subacute bacterial meningitis is documented, and this is the case we will present. Clinical Case A 22-year-old woman with no previous medical history, immunocompetent, with three months of behavioral, affective and cognitive symptoms with subsequent compromise of sensory perception and psychosis. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid showed inflammatory signs with positive FilmArray© for Streptococcus pneumoniae. She received anti-psychotic and antibiotic treatment for 2 weeks without clinical improvement. Postencephalitic syndrome with immune-mediated psychosis was considered as a diagnosis, and immunosuppressive management with corticosteroid and plasmapheresis was initiated with complete resolution of symptoms. After one year of follow-up no neurological relapse has been identified. Discussion Encephalitis is a neurological syndrome due to brain parenchymal damage that can result in psychiatric symptoms including psychosis and behavioral changes. Its causes are usually infectious (usually viral) or autoimmune (Anti NMDA, AMPA, LGI1 or others). A psychiatric condition in bacterial meningitis without improvement with antibiotic treatment is remarkable, its presence should suggest an immune-mediated post-infectious syndrome that may respond to the use of immunomodulators even in the absence of identification of autoimmune encephalitis-associated antibodies. No similar cases have been reported in the literature. Conclusion Immune-mediated psychosis may be a manifestation of post-encephalitic syndrome associated with bacterial meningitis and its treatment with immunosuppressants may offer benefit in cases where the use of antipsychotics and antibiotics shows no improvement.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

The sleep and wake cycles are controlled by the pacemaker activity of the superchiasmic nucleus in the hypothalamus but can be disrupted by diseases of the nervous system causing disordered sleep. A lack of sleep has been associated with an increase in all–cause mortality. Likewise, sleep disturbances and sleep disorders may disrupt neuronal pathways and have an impact on neurological diseases. Sleep deprivation studies in normal subjects demonstrate that a lack of sleep can cause attention and working memory impairment. Moreover, if untreated sleep disturbances and sleep disorders such as Obstructive Sleep Apnoe (OSA) can also lead to cognitive impairment. Poor sleep and sleep disorders may present a significant risk factor for the development of dementia. In this review, the underlying mechanisms and the role of sleep and sleep disorders in the development of neurocognitive disorders (dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) and, how the presence of sleep disorders could direct the process of diagnosis and management of neurocognitive disorders will be discussed.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Demyelinating and Degenerative Disorders",
      "abstract": "The terms demyelinating and degenerative have been used to classify two groups of disorders that have distinct neuropathological features. The disorders that compose these categories, and particularly the degenerative category, are quite diverse. As the term implies, degenerative is used to classify a group of disorders that involve degeneration of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Degenerative disorders include Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Pick's disease, among others. The etiology of many degenerative disorders is unknown and there are no identified antecedents to their onset. Rather, degenerative disorders begin insidiously and progress slowly, often over the course of many years. Typically, neuronal degeneration is bilateral. For many of these disorders, specific neuronal systems or neuroanatomical areas are affected more so than others. On the other hand, demyelinating disorders are grouped together because myelin destruction is their defining characteristic. Generally, the nerve cell itself is spared. Examples of demyelinating disorders include multiple sclerosis (MS), leukoencephalopathy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. While the etiology of some demyelinating disorders is known, for many the etiology is not known. The course of demyelinating diseases is varied. In some cases the disease can begin insidiously and then progress either gradually or quickly. In other cases, there appears to be only one or two exacerbations during the entire course of the disorder and little or no cognitive or physical disability.",

In some countries, brain stem death is equivalent to brain death. In others, including the Netherlands, in addition to the determination of brain stem death, an EEG must also be carried out to rule out cortex activity according to the criteria of \"whole brain death\". However, this does not prove that there is complete failure of all brain functions; indeed, EEG does not examine the subcortical brain. The Dutch Health Board has established that brain death is ruled out by rest activity in the cortex, but not by persistent subcortical activity. This is conceptually incorrect. The criteria for brain stem death fit better in practice than the criteria for whole brain death. Taking an EEG should therefore no longer be an obligation in establishing brain death, as is the case in many other countries.",

      "abstract": "People with severe mental illness are often overlooked in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. For a long time it was assumed that those with schizophrenia, the most common diagnosis in public treatment settings, were too disorganized or withdrawn to engage in the drug use and sexual behaviors related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure (Carmen and Brady 1990). The extent of these risk behaviors was unknown and uninvestigated. Unfortunately, this inattention may have facilitated the spread of HIV infection among people with the most severe psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular adverse events (AEs) in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are characterized by diverse clinical subsets. The general features of neuromuscular AEs have remained elusive due to its low frequency, ranging from 1-2% of cancer patients undergoing ICIs therapy. The diseases affect the central nervous system, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscle. Disease onset and progression may be rapid with a critical clinical course. The clinical presentation may differ from that of patients whose symptoms are unrelated to drugs. Headache, dizziness, and dysgeusia are relatively common and mild treatment-related AEs. In contrast, immune-related AEs, such as autoimmune encephalitis, demyelinating polyneuropathy, myasthenia, and myositis are more serious conditions. There is a strong correlation between ICIs and myasthenia, myositis, and myocarditis. Immune-modulating medication is generally effective for neuromuscular AEs. However, there are guidelines for treatment, and checkpoint inhibitor therapy should be withheld until the pathophysiology of the AEs is defined. Both CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular AEs. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of neuromuscular AEs is necessary to alleviate the symptoms associated with ICIs therapy in cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To demonstrate a case report of vertebrobasilar insufficiency caused by disseminated Coccidioidomycosis with central nervous system (CNS) involvement Background: Extrapulmonary disseminated CNS Coccidioidomycosis is a rare condition. However, CNS Coccidioidomycosis has a high mortality and relapse rate if untreated. The most common manifestations include nonspecific symptoms of headache, altered mental status and unexplained nausea/vomiting. Neuroimaging typically detects leptomeningeal enhancement of basilar cistern, sylvian fissure and pericallosal regions. Without adequate treatment, clinical course can be complicated by hydrocephalus, cranial neuropathy or arachnoiditis. We illustrate a rare example of CNS coccidioidomycosis resulting in vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Design/Methods: A case report Results: A case of 70 years old Hispanic male with diabetes mellitus presented with a 2-day history of recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness with transient binocular visual disturbance. Family denied seizure like activity, incontinence, or confusion. Neurological exam showed no focal neurological deficits or meningeal irritation signs. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium of brain showed an enhancement along the basal cistern, prechiasmatic optic nerve, optic chiasm, hypothalamus and encasement of vertebrobasilar arteries from the extra-axial pathology along the basal cistern which was confirmed by computed tomography angiography. Continuous electroencephalography could capture a typical event. There was generalized slow activities without epileptiform discharge which was suggestive of cerebral hypoperfusion. Serum 1,3 beta-d-Glucan level was elevated (389 pg/mL). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) manifested lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein (WBC 171cell/mm3 Lymphocyte 40% glucose 76mg/dL and protein 409mg/dL). Brain biopsy revealed acute inflammation. Elevation of CSF complement fixation for IgG of Coccidioides titer of 1:4 confirmed the diagnosis of Coccidioidal meningitis. Amphotericin B was initiated for 2 weeks and oral Fluconazole was continued for infinite. After treatment, patient had no further episodes of loss of consciousness or visual disturbances. Conclusions: CNS Coccidioidomycosis can present as vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Early recognition, prompt diagnosis and effective treatment reduces mortality and prevent complications.

Its management options are still inadequately optimized due to its challenging diversity in presentation, reflecting a range of different pathogenic mechanisms. A better understanding of SLE presentation might improve the present options for managing NPSLE. Here we report a series of five female patients with NPSLE. Out of the five presented cases, four patients have neurological features as an initial manifestation of SLE, which is considered uncommon. The first case of a 50-year-old female patient who had aseptic meningitis presented with headache, back pain, and lower limb weakness associated with numbness after 11 years of being diagnosed with SLE. The second case is of a 20-year-old female patient who had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with the acute manifestation of hypertensive urgency and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) as an initial manifestation of SLE. The third case is of a 38-year-old female patient who presented with an acute focal seizure as an initial manifestation of SLE. In the last two cases, a 38-year-old and a 19-year-old female patient presented with an ischemic stroke as the initial manifestation of SLE. On a final note, clinicians should always have SLE in mind as a differential diagnosis when it comes to acute neurological features presenting in any patient with SLE manifestations.",

Cases. Herein we present two cases of AHT (7-month-old boy, 7-month-old girl) according to forensic analysis, and discuss them in light of the current literature and share our experience. Inconsistency between the presenting history and the clinical findings were typical in both cases; follow-up histories and detailed workup revealed the diagnosis of AHT.

Many experts suggest that this syndrome is the late-20th-century formulation of an illness that has been described under various designations in medical literature for centuries, such as febricula (“little fevers”) in the 18th century, neurasthenia in the 19th century, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), in Great Britain and Canada, or chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS), in the United States, during the late 20th century. The designation chronic fatigue syndrome was adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) because this name does not assume a direct role for infection, inflammation, or immune system dysfunction in the genesis of the symptoms. Indeed, an abundance of research has failed to attribute the syndrome to any specific infection or immunologic disturbance. Nevertheless, CFS concerns infectious disease physicians because it is frequently recognized as a sequel of infection, ie, as postviral or postinfectious fatigue.",

      "abstract": "We read with interest the case of dengue encephalopathy by Kanade and Shah1 and have the following comments to offer: The authors have correctly listed the three types of neurological manifestations associated with dengue infection1. We would like to add ‘acute disseminated encephalomyelitis’ (ADEM) to the list of post-infection neurological manifestation of dengue fever. ADEM is a monophasic, post-infectious or post-vaccine acute inflammatory demyelinating disorder of central nervous system2. The pathophysiology involves transient autoimmune response directed at myelin or other self-antigens, possibly by molecular mimicry or by non-specific activation of autoreactive T-cell clones2. ADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection; usually in the form of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection3. Neurologic symptoms of ADEM commonly appear 4 to 13 days after the infection. ADEM can affect any part of the nervous system and thus the clinical presentation is variable. Patients can present with altered mental status, seizures, pyramidal dysfunction, cerebellar ataxia, brainstem syndromes, optic neuritis, myelitis, and rarely myeloradiculopathy and extrapyramidal syndromes2. The diagnosis of ADEM is based on clinical presentation and neuroimaging2,3. ADEM following dengue infection has been described in literature4,5. Although, ADEM following dengue infections is rare, it deserves mention as the management and prognosis depend on early recognition and treatment. It has been seen that the recovery is incomplete in patients with ADEM not receiving any form of immune modulation treatment (high dose methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis)2,3. The clinical presentation of the infant and cerebrospinal fluid analysis described by Kanade and Shah1 is similar to that of ADEM. However, the normal magnetic resonance imaging findings and the complete recovery without immune modulation treatment goes against ADEM. In conclusion, we would like to highlight that ADEM should be suspected in a child who develops multifocal neurologic abnormalities with encephalopathy, especially if onset occurs one to two weeks after dengue fever.

      "title": "Place du syndrome confusionnel en psychiatrie : une revue de littérature",
      "abstract": "Ce travail est une revue de litterature sur la place du delirium en psychiatrie. Le delirium (ou confusion ou syndrome confusionnel) est une affection neuropsychiatrique reconnue dans le DSM5 et la CIM-lO. Il est caracterise par une apparition brutale, une fluctuation clinique importante, des troubles de la cognition et de la vigilance. Selon le degre d'excitation psychomotrice, differentes formes de syndrome confusionnel sont distinguees dans la litterature actuelle : hypoactive, hyperactive ou mixte. Le trouble affecte preferentiellement les sujets âges, vulnerables du fait d'un grand nombre de facteurs de risque predisposants. H est frequemment sous diagnostique, touchant 14 a 24% de la population generale hospitaliere au moment de son admission. Il est associe a un mauvais pronostic, evoluant frequemment vers la demence, avec une mortalite elevee. Son etude est compliquee par sa fluctuation symptomatique, la variete de ses formes, la diversite de ses facteurs precipitants, et la difficile distinction entre les effets du trouble en lui-meme et ceux de ses etiologies. Malgre cela, des outils standardises (comme la CAM) existent permettant une demarche diagnostique rationnelle. Des biomarqueurs tels que la CRP et l'hemoglobinemie pourraient participer a l'evaluation du trouble mais ils sont cependant non specifiques. Le delirium semble pouvoir beneficier d'un traitement qui lui est propre : outre les mesures de prevention non-medicamenteuses, les neuroleptiques a dose relativement faibles, et peut etre la melatonine, pourraient etre efficaces quelle que soit l'etiologie. La physiopathologie du delirium est complexe mais semble caracterisee par une voie metabolique finale commune associant le plus souvent et principalement une hyperdopaminergie, un deficit en acethyl-choline et une hyperglutamatergie. Ce dernier mecanisme pourrait expliquer la neurotoxicite du syndrome confusionnel et son pronostic mediocre sur le plan cognitif. D'autres phenomenes, inflammatoires ou neuroendocriniens, pourraient etre aussi impliques. Cette revue de litterature amene a differentes conclusions et constatations : • Le delirium malgre sa complexite clinique, est une entite certes transnosographique, mais qui a une reelle coherence, tant sur le plan semiologique, que neurobiologique ou bien encore genetique. • Le delirium se rattache aux pathologies habituellement prises en charge en psychiatrie, par sa clinique, ses traitements, sa physiopathologie, sa genetique, mais il s'en distingue par ses facteurs precipitants. • La litterature scientifique actuelle n'apporte que peu d'elements sur la realite de « confusions psychiatriques » et sur l'interet d'une prise en charge psychiatrique de la confusion. ▪ Les troubles psychiatriques pourraient etre integres au modele general de vulnerabilite du delirium. Loin de lever l'ambiguite qui associe historiquement le syndrome confusionnel a la psychiatrie, ce travail amene a souhaiter sur le sujet, une meilleure diffusion dans le corps medical des connaissances, et un renforcement de l'interdisciplinarite des soins. Cette revue de la litterature a ouvert la voie a d'autres etudes qui pourraient par exemple comparer l'impact pronostic des patients confus en psychiatrie et en services conventionnels de soins.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury alone is a disability that takes all an individual's strength, both mental and physical, to overcome. Even after months of hard work by the SCI individual and health care professionals, there are still those who do not cope with or successfully overcome this disability. As the number of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases and these persons continue to remain typically asymptomatic for indefinite periods of time before they develop AIDS, it is reasonable to think that they will have the same incidence of traumatic injuries and illnesses (such as SCI) that others of the same group will have. The high cost of SCI rehabilitation is already exceeding the available funding. The practicality of attempting to rehabilitate an SCI patient who is perhaps unable to fully participate in the standardized, vigorous program because of another debilitating disease, AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), has yet to be decided. It follows that this will create a dilemma for the health care population that may be one of this nation's worst and potentially unsolvable problems.",

Heterotopia can be unilateral or bilateral, subependymal or subcortical, or it can extend from the subependymal region to the subcortex.1 Most individuals with heterotopia come to medical attention because of epileptic seizures, although the spectrum of clinical presentation is wide.2\n\nA lingering question concerns precisely how impairments in neuronal migration give rise to diverse syndromes. For instance, the most notable feature of lissencephaly, subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), and nodular heterotopia (NH) is a failure in the migration of early postmitotic neurons from their site of birth in the ventricular zone to the cortical plate. This migration failure results in the thickened and abnormally laminated cerebral cortex found in lissencephaly, the abnormal band of neurons found beneath the cerebral cortex in SBH, and the neuronal nodules lining the ventricular zone or just beneath a normal-appearing cerebral cortex in NH.3 As yet undetermined is whether other cellular defects occur in these syndromes, in addition to the migration defects.\n\nA better understanding of the functional organization of heterotopic nodules could also have practical implications for the planning of surgical treatment for the associated epilepsy.

      "abstract": "Work-related diseases of the musculoskeletal and the peripheral nervous system are classified as overload cumulative microtrauma diseases, resulting from chronic overload and/or damage of specific neuromusculoskeletal structures. Occupational activities which predispose to them are characterised by monotypy (repetition of movements during a significant part of the working shift). Authors described 4 cases of women with musculoskeletal and peripheral nervous system disorders qualified as occupational background just in the 2nd instance of medical certification. Detailed analysis of occupational exposure and medical interview with individual diagnostic approach allowed to determine the occupational etiology of diseases, regardless of non-occupational risk factors in some cases, even if the workstation was not common. Difficulties in estimating the probability of disease process induction on the background of occupational exposure are caused by frequent coexistence of non-occupational risk factors.

Magnitude and characteristics of subjective cognitive deficits, however, often receive less attention in this population at risk for developing dementia.We investigated predictors of subjective cognitive deficits in patients with MCI, using a detailed assessment for such impairments associated with different cognitive domains, as well as demographic and clinical variables including magnetic resonance imaging data.The strongest predictor for subjective memory deficits was depressed mood, whereas subjective performance issues associated with attention or executive functions also corresponded to measurable impairments in the respective cognitive domains. Reduced hippocampal thickness and hemispheric entorhinal cortex thickness asymmetry were associated with objective memory impairment but not with subjective deficits or symptoms of depression.Whereas low objective memory performance and reduced cortical thickness within medial temporal lobe subregions could be associated with neurodegeneration, greater subjective memory deficits in patients with MCI may indicate psychological burden.",

Focal neurologic signs are sometimes subtle and, as they point to dangerous causes, must be searched for. The acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) is most frequently caused by vestibular neuritis (VN) or ischaemic stroke in the brainstem or cerebellum. More than half of patients presenting with AVS due to ischaemic stroke lack obvious focal neurological signs, closely mimicking benign peripheral vestibular disorders (‘vestibular pseudoneuritis’). A careful bedside ocular motor examination—HINTS (Head Impulse test, Nystagmus and Test of Skew)—reliably identifies cerebellar stroke. Transient acute vertigo and dizziness are frequently caused by peripheral entities such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Menière’s disease (MD).",

Presence of hallucinations is one of the main risk factors associated with dementia, and severity progression of VH mainly contributes to impaired quality of life in PD. The neuropsychological features associated with severity progression of VH are unknown and might help to detect patients at risk of a more severe outcome. We aimed to explore the neuropsychological deficits associated with the different types of VH observed in PD, from minor hallucinations to well‐formed VH with loss of insight. Prospective study of 57 PD patients with (n = 29) and without VH (n = 28) matched for age, education, antiparkinsonian medications, and disease duration. Description of VH was assessed by the Hallucinations and Psychosis item of the MDS‐UPDRS. Cognition was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease‐Cognitive Rating Scale (PD‐CRS) and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Patients with minor VH did not differ from patients without VH in any cognitive domain. PD patients with major VH and insight retained performed worse on the action verbal fluency task ( P &lt; 0.04), and patients with VH and loss of insight showed a greater impairment on the PD‐CRS posterior cortical score ( P = 0.021) and the clock copying item ( P = 0.01). A double dissociation was found in the neuropsychological profile of patients with VH with and without loss of insight. While the presence of major VH with insight retained appeared related to a predominant frontal‐striatal impairment, loss of insight was characterized by further impairment of cognitive functions related to posterior cortical areas. A comprehensible continuum pattern of clinical relationships emerged among VH and cognitive functioning in PD. © 2010 Movement Disorder Society.",

      "abstract": "A group of chronic alcoholics were classified as Primary or Secondary alcoholics according to a self-administering questionnaire. Primary, compared to Secondary, alcoholics claimed a significantly higher number of childhood symptoms associated with the Hyperkinetic and/or the Minimal Brain Dysfunction (Hk/MBD) Syndromes. Primary alcoholics also performed significantly poorer on the Shipley and Raven tests than Secondary alcoholics and had more severe alcoholic dependence scores. High Hk/MBD patients performed more poorly than Low Hk/MBD patients on the Shipley ard Raven tests. The results support the hypothesis that a childhood history of Hk/MBD might be a predisposing factor to a more severe type of alcoholism. The results also suggest that certain alcoholics may have premorbid deficits in cognitive functions.",

Idiopathic hypersomnia and Kleine–Levin syndrome have attracted much interest in recent years, and an overview of recent progresses is presented in this chapter. The symptomatic hypersomnias are less well known to sleep physicians and often neglected by specialists, either internists or psychiatrists, although they may seriously impact the quality of life of patients",

However, loss of vision due to a lesion involving the lateral geniculate body alone is unusual. We report one such case of a young female who developed acute bilateral painless loss of vision without any other symptom during postpartum period. MRI brain showed features of PRES involving bilateral lateral geniculate body, hippocampus and brainstem. There was no involvement of retrogeniculate visual pathway, i.e. parieto-occipital cortex.

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can occur in the absence of any other obvious asso- ciated neurologic disorder or in association with a neurodegenerative disease, in which case it is considered as symptomatic RBD. RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

The key to understanding the nature of aphasic symptoms is the neuro‐anatomical site of brain damage, and not the causative agent. However, because Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis infection usually affects the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures and hippocampal tissue, the link between aphasia and HSV encephalitis is investigated in this article, based on the neuro‐anatomical site of brain damage caused by such infection. A longitudinal case study of a patient with HSV encephalitis infection suggested the presence of fluent, conduction aphasia. The features included fluent conversational speech, superior comprehension of spoken language, and normal to good comprehension of reading matter, but defective handwriting, impaired reading aloud, circumlocution, visual field loss, poor auditory memory and repetition.

      "abstract": "Acute adrenal cortex insufficiency is a rare disease, which is hard to diagnose because of its diffuse symptoms. Symptoms, such as general weakness, nausea or vomiting, fatigue, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia and pronounced hypotension up to shock can be crucial in the diagnosis of an adrenal cortex crisis. The underlying disease of adrenal cortex insufficiency is also characterized by not always obvious symptoms, which are differently expressed depending on whether it is the primary or secondary type.After the diagnosis is made it is important to educate the patients, determine the optimal dosage of the substitution and ensure the compliance of the patients to optimize the further process and avoid an adrenal crisis. An adrenal crisis is one of the reasons for a higher mortality of these patients, which is well-described in the current literature. Descriptions of fatal courses and their reasons are rare; however, knowledge of the disease and the importance of rapid intervention is very important, especially for physicians who work in the emergency room or intensive care unit (ICU).This article reports about a female patient with a known secondary adrenal cortex insufficiency who developed the complete picture of an adrenal crisis. Despite rapid diagnosis and initiation of treatment massive brain damage could not be averted due to hypoxia and hypoglycemia. This case report demonstrates the potential symptoms, in particular a massive hypoglycemia and an initial shock refractory to catecholamine. It also shows the severity of that disease and the importance of rapid treatment even though it is difficult to make the diagnosis.Die akute Nebennierenrindeninsuffizienz (NNRI) ist eine seltene Erkrankung, welche aufgrund ihrer diffusen Symptomatik oft schwer zu diagnostizieren ist. Symptome wie allgemeine Schwäche, Übelkeit/Erbrechen, Müdigkeit, Hyponatriämie, Hyperkaliämie, Hypoglykämie sowie ausgeprägte Hypotonie bis zum Schock können in der Diagnosestellung einer Nebennierenrindenkrise wegweisend sein. Die Grunderkrankung der NNRI ist ebenso von nicht immer eindeutigen Symptomen geprägt und je nach primärer oder sekundärer Form unterschiedlich ausgeprägt.Nach der Diagnosestellung sind die Patientenschulung, die richtige Dosierung der Substitutionsmedikation und die Adhärenz der Patienten entscheidend für den weiteren Verlauf, insbesondere für die Vermeidung einer Nebennierenkrise. Diese stellt eine Ursache der erhöhten Mortalität betroffener Patienten dar, was in der aktuellen Literatur häufig beschrieben ist. Jedoch zeigt sich in der Literaturrecherche, dass der Verlauf solcher Krisen bzw. die Kausalität von letalen Verläufen selten thematisiert wird, obwohl das Wissen um die Erkrankung und ein damit verbundenes, rasches Handeln v. a. für in der Notaufnahme und auf der Intensivstation tätige Ärzte von großer Bedeutung sind.Berichtet wird über eine Patientin, die bei bekannter sekundärer NNRI das Vollbild einer Nebennierenkrise entwickelte. Trotz rascher Diagnosestellung sowie Therapieeinleitung war infolge von prolongierter Hypoxie und Hypoglykämie ein massiver Hirnschaden unabwendbar. Der Fallbericht zeigt die mögliche Symptomatik, v. a. eine massive Hypoglykämie und einen initial katecholaminrefraktären Schock. Außerdem zeigt er die Schwere des Krankheitsbildes und stellt die Bedeutung einer schnellen Therapie trotz erschwerter Diagnosestellung dar.",

According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3), narcolepsy is typically associated with cataplexy and/or other REM sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Narcolepsy is not an uncommon disorder, but is under-recognized. The age of onset shows two peaks of presentation: in childhood and in adults. Both genetics and environmental factors may be involved in the development of narcolepsy. The history, combined with polysomnography and MSLT, remain the current gold standard in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The levels of Hypocretin-1 are undetectable in the cerebrospinal fluid in most patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Early recognition and treatment can greatly improve the quality of life of patients with narcolepsy. Treatment of narcolepsy includes non-pharmacological treatment (life style changes) and pharmacological (stimulants, modafinil, sodium oxybate) against hypersomnia and anticataplectic drugs (antidepressants and sodium oxybate).",

      "abstract": "Persistence of symptoms beyond the initial 3 to 4 weeks after infection is defined as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). A wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and cognitive disturbances have been observed in PACS. The review was conducted based on PRISMA-S guidelines for literature search strategy for systematic reviews. A cytokine storm in COVID-19 may cause a breach in the blood brain barrier leading to cytokine and SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain. This triggers an immune response in the brain by activating microglia, astrocytes, and other immune cells leading to neuroinflammation. Various inflammatory biomarkers like inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, acute phase proteins and adhesion molecules have been implicated in psychiatric disorders and play a major role in the precipitation of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Impaired adult neurogenesis has been linked with a variety of disorders like depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, and dementia. Persistence of neuroinflammation was observed in COVID-19 survivors 3 months after recovery. Chronic neuroinflammation alters adult neurogenesis with pro-inflammatory cytokines supressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines favouring adult neurogenesis. Based on the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms/disorders in PACS, there is more possibility for a potential impairment in adult neurogenesis in COVID-19 survivors. This narrative review aims to discuss the various neuroinflammatory processes during PACS and its effect on adult neurogenesis.",

It is caused by severe hypothyroidism, resulting in multiorgan failure with features including adrenal insufficiency, thermal dysregulation, and altered mentation. Generally, it is observed in untreated and poorly managed cases of hypothyroidism. However, stress from infections, surgical procedures, and medical comorbidities may precipitate this condition. It is particularly uncommon to see MC arise in the setting of ESS, especially in a patient with no history of thyroid disease, which makes this diagnosis easy to miss. In our case, a 36-year-old female presented with septic shock and was admitted to the ICU, where she subsequently developed ESS and features of MC. This case report aims to explore the risk factors, features, and diagnostic and therapeutic management of these conditions, as well as the diagnostic challenges that arise when these diseases present simultaneously.",

      "abstract": "The major cognitive impairment in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is frontal lobe symptoms, such as psychomotor slowing and impairment of attention, working memory, verbal fluency and executive function. Compared with Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontal lobe symptoms are disproportionately severe and the impairment of memory and orientation is disproportionately mild in patients with iNPH. Concerning memory impairment, recognition memory is relatively preserved compared with recall in iNPH. The cognitive impairment of iNPH could be classified into subcortical dementia type. However, compared with Binswanger's disease, impairment of memory and visuospatial attention in NPH may be more severe. Agraphia is also found in some iNPH patients. Thus, iNPH patients could have not only cognitive impairment of subcortical but also cortical types. After shunt operation, cognitive impairment improves but marked improvement in cognitive functions is less frequent than that of the gait disorder. The impairment of memory, working memory and visuoconstructive and psychomotor slowing appears likely to respond shunt surgery. However, in iNPH patients with impairment of memory and either of visuoconstructive or executive function, improvement of overall cognitive deficits after shunt surgery is less, suggesting that a higher degree of neural impairment may identify less reversible injury or that superimposed AD might limit the potential to show improvement. Neuroanatomical bases of cognitive impairment of iNPH are not well documented. However, damage of periventricular structures, such as corpus callosum, frontal subcortical and cortical areas, thalamus, basal ganglia and hippocampus, could be associated with cognitive impairment of iNPH.",

      "abstract": "A woman with a seventeen-year history of HIV infection on effective antiretroviral therapy presented with signs and symptoms of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP). She developed significant side effects (dizziness, nausea, edema) with medications for pain management. Chart review revealed a history of similar intolerance to multiple antiretrovirals, which was not explained by known cardiac or gastrointestinal disease or psychological factors. Specialized testing revealed the presence of an autonomic neuropathy, which provided an explanation for her medication intolerance. The patient was educated on the symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and its relationship to DSP and subsequent symptomatic medications were initiated at the lowest possible doses. Although symptom management remained challenging, the patient exhibited lower frustration and greater acceptance of medication trials. Review of 168 advanced stage HIV infected individuals demonstrated that 81% experienced at least one, and 33% three or more, symptoms potentially attributable to autonomic neuropathy. Potentially autonomic symptoms were significantly associated with the presence of symptomatic DSP. Autonomic neuropathy is difficult to diagnose without specialized testing, as its symptoms are non-specific and overlap with a large number of somatic disorders. The high prevalence of autonomic-type symptoms in chronic HIV, and their association with peripheral neuropathy, may warrant further investigation of the potential for autonomic dysfunction in individuals with HIV-related symptomatic DSP.",

Results 69.9% of cases had LowP, 22.7% had PurP, and 7.5% had mixed SevP. Additional LowP increased the likelihood of having mild dementia versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by almost 20‐fold (odds ratio = 19.5). Discussion Most aged individuals have multiple brain pathologies. The presence of one additional LowP can significantly worsen cognitive decline, increasing the risk of transitioning from MCI to dementia 20‐fold.

It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is.

The literature provides case reports to the course of adults. The term has been used first in 1996 by Hinchey on the occasion of a series of 15 cases. Those patients exhibited a reversible syndrome with headache, neuropsychological distinctive features, visual abnormalities (blurry gaze, visual hallucinations, visual neglect, hemianopia, and cortical blindness) and seizures. The posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is known under merely different designations and a misnomer, because it is not reversible in all of the cases, not always limited to the posterior regions of the brain and the gray matter often is affected too. The causes are versatile. Triggers primarily are chemotherapeutic agents and immunosuppressive drugs, renal diseases as well as accelerated blood pressure with hypertensive crises. These are responsible for the development of a vasogenic edema. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is the favored modality of investigation. Cerebral edema involving the posterior regions of the cerebral hemispheres, particularly the posterior parietal and occipital lobes, is seen as increased T2 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient maps show increased signal, and diffusion weighted imaging images normal or decreased signal intensity of lesions. These features can differentiate between vasogenic cerebral edema in PRES. Prognostic crucial is a rapid start of an efficient therapy (decline of the hypertension and stop of the responsible medication). We report the case of a 14-year-old boy with PRES within the frame work of an unknown hypertension before admission to the hospital and a girl aged 16 years with unknown origin who also presented with PRES. Furthermore, we want to give an overview of the literature with a special attention to the publications to PRES in children.",

      "abstract": "Neuroacanthocytosis is an inclusive term for a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the association of neurological abnormalities with red cell acanthocytosis. In the late 1960s, Levine et al. reported a family with a syndrome of neurological deficits such as choreiform involuntary movements, epileptic seizures, intellectual impairment, and paranoid ideation along with acanthocytosis without any disturbance in either alpha- or beta-lipoproteins nor retinitis pigmentosa. Critchley et al. also reported familial cases with acanthocytosis and neurological disorders without beta-lipoproteinemia. These cases have been classified as the Levine-Critchley syndrome of neuroacanthocytosis. Cases of neuroacanthocytosis have been classified into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of movement disorders such as chorea. One group comprises the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes in which neurodegeneration occurs primarily in the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum, causing movement disorders. The core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes mainly comprise of the two diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and the McLeod syndrome. Huntington's disease-like 2, and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) are very rare but these diseases can also be included in this group of syndromes. Advances in molecular genetics have enabled us to distinguish between these diseases. Recently, the hypoprebetalipoproteinemia, acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa and pallidal degeneration syndrome (HARP syndrome) has been genetically shown to be an allelic form of PKAN. The second group of neuroacanthocytosis syndromes includes abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig disease) and hypobetalipoproteinemia that are characterized by the abnormal decay of lipoprotein with the intestinal malabsorption of fat leading to neurological abnormalities and acanthocytosis. In this type of neuroacanthocytosis shows a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia with peripheral neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa are observed, but movement disorders are not seen.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

      "title": "Autoimmune mediated suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "There is a known autoimmune disease, which is called ‘anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis’, or ‘Dalmau encephalitis’ (named after its discoverer). It is associated with the presence of high titers of antibodies to a certain epitope of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the blood and/or in the cerebrospinal fluid. This disease in its classic form is accompanied by severe mental (depression, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, catatonia, etc.) and neurological (convulsions, dyskinesias) symptoms, disturbances of consciousness and autonomic regulation (regulation of respiration, temperature, blood pressure, heart rhythm), as well as with suicidality, which seems to be disproportionate to the severity of mental disturbances. However, there are also ‘non-classical’ forms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. These can manifest with exclusively psychiatric symptoms (for example, depression, psychosis, suicidal behavior), without characteristic neurological symptoms and/or disorders of autonomic regulation. In some of these cases, the correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was delayed by months, years or even decades. In addition, in recent decades, increasing evidence had accumulated that in some patients with so-called ‘classical’ mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive disorders – and especially in those who show resistance to traditional psychopharmacotherapy – elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in their blood and/or in their cerebrospinal fluid. It has also been shown that elevated blood titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are often detected in post-mortem examinations of suicide victims. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody titers in psychiatric patients correlate well with a recent history of suicide attempts and/or with current active suicidal ideation. Some of these patients may benefit from aggressive immunosuppressive therapy that is similar to the regimens normally used to treat ‘classical’ anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with neurological and autonomic manifestations. This might stop their suicidal ideation and/or help in overcoming their resistance to psychopharmacotherapy. This article presents a description and analysis of three clinical cases of patients with various mental disorders, acute suicidality and elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, in whom such therapy has been effective.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "Epidemiology and clinical features of HIV‐1 associated neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral neuropathy is common in human immunodeficiency virus type‐1 (HIV‐1) infection. Peripheral neuropathies complicate all stages of the HIV‐1 disease and cause considerable morbidity and disability in HIV‐1 infected individuals and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Whereas symptomatic neuropathies occur in approximately 10% to 15% of HIV‐1‐infected patients overall, pathologic evidence of peripheral nerve involvement is present in virtually all end‐stage AIDS patients. There are 6 major clinical types of HIV‐associated neuropathies that are regularly seen in large HIV‐1 clinics. Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common among the HIV‐1‐associated neuropathies. DSP generally occurs in later stages of HIV‐1 infection and it follows an indolent and protracted clinical course. The dominant clinical features in DSP include distal pain, paresthesia and numbness in a typical length‐dependent fashion with proximal to distal gradient. Whereas toxic neuropathies—secondary to certain antiretroviral agents—are clinically similar to DSP, their temporal relation to neurotoxic medication helps distinguish them from other HIV‐1‐associated neuropathies. DSP and toxic neuropathy may coexist in a single patient. Acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies (AIDP and CIDP) produce global limb weakness. AIDP may occur at seroconversion and it can therefore be the initial manifestation of HIV‐1 infection. CIDP generally occurs in the mid to late stages of HIV‐1 infection. Progressive polyradiculopathy (PP) occurs in patients with advanced immunodeficiency and is generally caused by the opportunist cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Mononeuropathy multiplex (MM) in early stages of HIV‐1 infection is immune mediated, whereas in advanced AIDS it is caused by the CMV infection. Finally, subclinical autonomic nervous system involvement is common in all stages of HIV‐1 infection. Because HIV‐1‐associated neuropathies are diverse in their etiology and pathogenesis, a precise clinical diagnosis is required to formulate a rational therapeutic intervention.",

In a most recent careful follow-up study, so-called isolated DVM was associated with minor neurologic abnormalities. This association implies that there may be some underlying neurologic defect that causes DVM, but whether DVM is due to a delay in sensory development or a delay in motor fixation is unknown. Optic nerve hypoplasia, atrophy, and coloboma have all been reported in children exposed to cocaine in utero. Optic nerve hypoplasia is a condition in which the optic nerves fail to develop a normal number of axons.

      "title": "Syndrome III: Epileptic Syndromes III: Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsies and Photosensitivity (with Special Regards to Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy and Epilepsy with Eye‐Closure–Triggered Paroxysmal Activity as Neurobehavioral Syndromes)",
      "abstract": "The basic mechanisms underlying interictal behavioral problems in patients with epilepsy remain mostly speculative. The most prevailing view is that the long-standing effect of clinical or subclinical seizure discharges culminates in some structural modification of the neural network, which finally leads to persistent behavioral problems in some patients, although in a quite unpredictable manner. The theory of temporal-limbic hyperconnection in temporal lobe epilepsy, which was once in vogue, is a representative explanation along these lines. The two papers reviewed in this section address unique interictal neurobehavioral problems, which apparently require another type of explanation for their pathogenesis. The case presented by Termine and coworkers was closely related to the type of cognitive decline otherwise characteristic of CSWS or LKS. These striking epileptic syndromes, the former of which was initially described by Tassinari and colleagues in Bologna, added greatly to our knowledge of behavioral or cognitive disorders as a result of epilepsy by proving that epilepsy per se causes lasting cognitive damage, independent of the direct effects of seizure discharge at a given time. However, it remains to be shown whether such conspicuous cognitive consequences are rare exceptions, strictly limited to CSWS and LKS. Many of the papers in this supplement appear to confirm rather subtle, yet definite, cognitive alterations in children with BECT. Considering the close relationship between the age-dependent localization-related epilepsy of BECTS and CSWS/LKS, this is perhaps not surprising. The report by Termine et al., though only a preliminary case study, has opened a new dimension to this question, because eye-closure–triggered paroxysmal activity is quite new as a possible cause of slowly progressive intellectual decline apparently secondary to continuous spike wave complexes that appear only in strictly limited circumstances. The unique finding of Janz that JME is closely coupled with an “evening type” behavioral pattern has seldom been regarded as a subject for scientific reappraisal. However, in the second part of their presentation, Pung and Schmitz concluded that circadian dysrhythmia is a symptom of JME rather than a condition that facilitates the manifestation of seizures. This conclusion was based on data accumulated with a specially designed questionnaire. They also suggested that circadian dysrhythmia and seizures are independent manifestations of a common underlying frontal dysregulation in JME, which is a genetically determined predisposition. In conclusion, this section has shown multiple routes by which clinical seizures and behavioral features in patients with epilepsy are coupled. As Pung and Schmitz noted, these findings may help to facilitate a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying a variety of complex neurobehavioral syndromes in epilepsy.",

Over half of these patients either survived for five to 16 months or died without exhibiting systemic manifestations of AIDS.

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives A neuropsychological case study of Late-Onset Multiple Sclerosis (LOMS). Cognitive impairment often accompanies Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Depending on disease phase/type, 40–65% of MS patients develop various degrees of cognitive impairment. LOMS is a rare branch of Multiple Sclerosis with an onset of 50 years or older. Like MS it has demyelinating qualities, however it typically has a neurodegenerative course rather than inflammatory properties. Additionally, unlike traditional MS, LOMS presents with greater motor and cognitive dysfunction. Methods The patient, a 61-year-old, Caucasian, right-handed male, 18 years of education initially presented with acute onset of vague cognitive changes along with significant motor dysfunction. A cerebral MRI revealed white matter disease in the cerebral hemispheres with the largest lesion adjacent to the right frontal horn. Lesions involved bifrontal/parietal lobes, specific lesion posteriorly in the left centrum and right caudate head. Results Patient was administered the Meyers Neuropsychological Battery (MNB). Findings were consistent with level one central processing deficits with attention/concentration and processing speed. Deficits were noted with primary and psychomotor abilities. Patient’s premorbid estimate was T-58. Overall Test Battery Mean (T-52) and Domain Test Battery Mean (T-51) were generally within the expected range. Remaining neuropsychological abilities were relatively intact (e.g., memory, abstraction, language, spatial). Conclusions Consistent with the literature, higher-order cognitive abilities were relatively intact. LOMS mirrored early-onset MS in this case. However, a significant risk factor for LOMS is the possibility of co-occurring neurodegenerative disease. This underscores the need for comprehensive neuropsychological assessment that includes motor testing for MS.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

The cases include unusual emergency presentations such as posterior circulation stroke and non-convulsive status epilepticus, as well as important conditions that are less familiar such as dystonia, viral or autoimmune encephalitis, and neuromyelitis optica. The book covers neurological subspecialties including stroke, epilepsy, dementia, demyelination, movement disorders, infectious diseases, neuromuscular disorders, sleep disorders, uroneurology, and neurogenetics. Allied specialty cases include neurosurgery, neuro-ophthalmology, and rehabilitation medicine. Each case begins with a case history before a discussion of the topic and relevant up-to-date evidence for diagnosis, investigations, and management. Landmark trials, clinical tips, and key learning points are interspersed in the case, as well as commentaries by leading experts in the field. Figures range from photographs of anti-epileptic drug cutaneous reactions and fundi to neuroimaging and electroencephalograms. Investigations such as visual perimetry, audiograms, and sleep actigraphy are also explained to readers. The book is aimed at trainees in neurology, neurophysiology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neuropathology, and internal medicine.",

Psychogenic non'epileptic seizures (PNES) do occur in people with ID, particularly in those within the mild range of ID and with associated epilepsy. Two epilepsy syndromes that are strongly associated with ID have been the subject of several drug trials: infantile spasms and Lennox'Gastaut syndrome. The chapter chronologically addresses the newer drugs according to their year of global licensing. An increasing number of specific treatments are now available in various genetic disorders with ID and epilepsy. Phenylketonuria (PKU), the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, is a model disorder. Oromucosal (or nasal) delivery of midazolam may be a more convenient and socially acceptable method for acute seizure treatment.",

Schizophrenia, depression, developmental disorders, acquired brain disorders (traumatic brain injury and stroke), and neurodegenerative disorders all have cognitive impairment as a manifestation. Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

Ser sem-abrigo resulta de um fenómeno heterogéneo e multidimensional, que pode afetar não só os indivíduos mais vulneráveis, como também aqueles que se encontram numa situação económica e social estável. A relação entre ser sem-abrigo e ter doença psiquiátrica é há muito conhecida. Há uma maior prevalência de todas as patologias mentais em sem-abrigo em relação à população geral, situando-se entre os 25 a 50%. O risco de ficar em situação de sem-abrigo para pessoas diagnosticadas com doenças mentais é dez vezes maior do que para a população em geral, na medida em que a funcionalidade e a autonomia dos indivíduos podem ficar altamente afetadas. Além disso, as adversidades associadas a tornar-se e a permanecer sem-abrigo são complexas e podem também elas criar combinações únicas de fatores de stresse para problemas de saúde mental. Trabalhar com pessoas em situação de sem-abrigo e, especialmente com doença mental, é um trabalho exigente. O problema central nos sem-abrigo com doenças mentais é a falta de acessibilidade aos tratamentos na comunidade e de habitação adequada. As políticas sociais devem ser abrangentes e ter em consideração a heterogeneidade da população sem-abrigo, desenvolvendo estratégias ajustadas às diferentes necessidades, flexíveis e adaptadas a cada pessoa.",

      "title": "Electrodiagnostic Evaluation Of Critical Illness Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "As medicine advances, more critically ill patients are surviving longer ICU admissions. Patients with sepsis, multi-organ failure, severe burns, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and polypharmacy often develop profound neuromuscular weakness during their hospitalization despite appropriate medical interventions and treatments. Often referred to as “intensive care unit acquired weakness” (ICUAW) this underdiagnosed condition most commonly results from a spectrum of critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), critical illness myopathy (CIM), or a combination of both. While CIP and CIM often occur simultaneously, it is important to understand the key features of each condition to ensure prompt recognition, prevent further disability, and ensure better patient outcomes. While the conditions are often underdiagnosed, studies show that the incidence of ICUAW in patients with greater than seven days of mechanical ventilation may range from 25% to 83%. Critical illness neuropathy may be evident as a patient fails to wean off the ventilator or if the patient has profound weakness or numbness in extremities upon awakening from sedation. A physical exam may also reveal diminished deep tendon reflexes, possible muscle atrophy, or balance impairment upon leaving the ICU. Bulbar and extraocular muscles will often be spared in CIP. Laboratory studies such as cerebrospinal fluid will usually be normal; this may help differentiate the condition from other illnesses with similar presentations, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) will be within normal limits in CIP and can become elevated in CIM. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis is the most frequent underlying factor in CIP (as opposed to the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids, which predominate in CIM).Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of critical illness neuropathy remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography. It should be noted that while EMG is the optimal way to make a diagnosis of CIP, there are many challenges to performing a complete study in ICU conditions, including electrical interference, anasarca, hypothermia, peripheral edema, or limited patient participation in the exam. Nevertheless, in the evaluation of profound weakness in the ICU setting, electrodiagnostic testing is an essential tool that can direct the clinical team in determining further management. Pathophysiology of CIP/CIM Etiology is not entirely clear, but it is though to be complex and multi-factorial in nature. Ultimately it lead to axonal dysfunction, ischemia, and degeneration necessitating aggressive treatment of underlying medical causes and physical neurorehabilitation. It is thought to be related to abnormal vascular, metabolic, and electrical processes leading to motor and/or sensory neuron abnormalities: Vascular autoregulation-leading to increase microvascular permeability (e.g. dilation of vessels) which can result in edema, hypoxemia, pro-inflammatory invasion of leukocytes and cytokines, and occlusion within the muscle-neuron units Metabolic-generation of reactive oxygen and nitric oxide species, failure of mitochondrial repair, neuronal hyperglycemic damage, and hypoalbuminemia Electrical-disruption of sodium and calcium channels and loss of cellular excitability Summary of clinical and histopathological features of CIP/CIM 1. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy Predisposing factors: sepsis with concurrent encephalopathy, recurrent exposure to non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, and multi-organ failure Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more distal than proximal with preserved muscle bulk or mild atrophy Early loss of deep tendon reflexes or areflexia Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy 2. Critical Illness Myopathy Predisposing factors: recurrent exposure to neuromuscular blocking agents, severe asthma, pneumonia, prolonged acidemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, prolonged high dose corticosteroid use, prolonged use of aminoglycosides, sepsis, multi-organ failure, and organ transplantation Presence of diffuse paraparesis and/or paraplegia, more proximal than distal with severe atrophy Delayed loss of deep tendon reflexes Long-standing difficulty weaning mechanical ventilation after exclusion of cardiopulmonary etiologies Electrodiagnostic evidence of motor unit and recruitment abnormalities as well as an absence of excitability with muscle stimulation, with possible preservation of sensory potentials Biopsy: Type II atrophic myofibers on H&E and myofiber necrosis",

Clinically, patients present with multifocal neurologic abnormalities reflecting the widespread involvement in central nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid may be normal or may show a mild pleocytosis with or without elevated protein levels. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) shows multiple demyelinating lesions. The diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis requires both multifocal involvement and encephalopathy by consensus criteria. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis typically has a monophasic course with a favorable prognosis. Multiphasic forms have been reported, resulting in diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing these cases from multiple sclerosis. In addition, many inflammatory disorders may have a similar presentation with frequent occurrence of encephalopathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.",

Als solcher wird Rückenschmerz definiert, der ohne identifizierbare anatomische und/oder neurophysiologische Faktoren auftritt. Davon abzugrenzen sind Rückenschmerzen bei Irritationen der Nervenwurzeln und anderen spinalen neurologischen Prozessen wie beispielsweise Tumorleiden oder entzündliche Prozesse. Als spezifische Rückenschmerzursachen können Faktoren identifiziert werden, wie Bandscheibenherniation, Spondylolisthesis, Spinalstenosen, Instabilität der Wirbelsäule, Wirbelfrakturen, Wirbeltumore, Infektionen oder entzündliche Erkrankungen. Patienten mit einer neurologisch identifizierbaren Lumboischialgie mit klarer radikulärer Ausbreitung gehören zur Gruppe der Patienten mit spezifischen Rückenschmerzen. Gemäß aktueller epidemiologischer Daten sind jedoch nur maximal 150/0 der Patienten mit Rückenschmerzen in diese bekannten spezifischen Ursachengruppen einzuordnen, der übergroße Teil von rund 850/0 der Rückenschmerzpatienten leidet an unspezifischen Rückenschmerzen.",

      "abstract": "The term Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) was initially used in the 1950s [1]. ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

      "abstract": "Infections can be the cause of emotional disturbances. The psychological aspects related to them have been studied for decades with more emphasis in tuberculosis. On the most recent time scale COVID has been the virus most profoundly and published studies on psychological disorder manifestations. Indications for psychotherapy have multiplied during the COVID pandemic. Also noteworthy are all other infections, such as mPOX, brucellosis, verminosis, influenza etc. Many individuals in contact with virus carriers, such as flu, do not acquire the virus infection while others, per example tuberculosis patients do not become infected by Koch's bacillus. In some patients the symptoms of the infection may disappear in a matter of days, while others even present longer clinical evolution as a neurotropism allergy to brucellosis. This suggests an interrelationship between infections and immune defenses, mainly due to psychic factors influencing the hypothalamic-adrenal axis and producing the relative insufficiency of the adrenal cortex. The attitude of affection and interest adopted by the physician and auxiliary person is of paramount importance, as a form of labor therapy, in an adequate work and subsequent feeling of usefulness. In conclusion, the proper health education related to the illness and treatment plan should be provided to the patients along with their family members. There is a need to improve access to counseling and mental healthcare among patients living with infections.",

      "title": "Mixed dementia and hyperactive delirium: a diagnostic challenge",
      "abstract": "It is well recognised that acute confusion or delirium complicates up to 10% of acute medical admissions. Disorientation in time and place with an impaired short-term memory and conscious level are the hallmarks of an acute confusion. In delirium, disorders of perception may produce restlessness and agitation. A similar state during the final days of life is termed ‘terminal delirium’. Less than 10% of affected individuals will have a primary neurological disorder, for example, dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with varying aetiologies. Currently there are at least 50 million people globally suffering from dementia rendering it a global healthcare problem. Mixed dementia (MD) can be defined as a cognitive decline sufficient to impair independent functioning in daily life resulting from the coexistence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology. MD occurs in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder, such as AD, Lewy body or Pick’s disease and additionally cerebrovascular disease. The mechanistic synergisms between the coexisting pathologies affecting dementia risk, progression and the ultimate clinical manifestations remain elusive. Although AD can be diagnosed with a considerable degree of accuracy, the distinction between isolated AD, vascular dementia and MD, when both pathologies coexist in the same patient remains one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges because their clinical presentation can overlap. Neuropathological studies indicate that mixed vascular Alzheimer’s dementia (MD) has a prevalence of 22% in the elderly. The authors present the case of a 78-year-old man with a diagnosis of MD presenting to the emergency department with delirium, a common but serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with the core features of inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. This case demonstrates the challenges in establishing a diagnosis in patients presenting with MD and shows that a cognitive assessment at presentation in a delirious state offers very little diagnostic information. It is therefore suggested to conduct a routine cognitive function examination on patients with dementia to anticipate new neurological signs and/or symptoms thus allowing earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, a baseline cognitive assessment when the patient was well, duration and nature of deterioration as well as collateral history will help differentiate delirium from an underlying dementia.",

It is often claimed that MDD is a “brain disease.” What would it mean for MDD to be a brain disease? I argue that the best interpretation of this claim is as offering a substantive empirical hypothesis about the causes of the syndrome of depression. This syndrome-causal conception of disease, combined with the idea that MDD is a disease of the brain, commits the brain disease conception of MDD to the claim that brain dysfunction causes the symptoms of MDD. I argue that this consequence of the brain disease conception of MDD is false. It incorrectly rules out genuine instances of content-sensitive causation between adverse conditions in the world and the characteristic symptoms of MDD. Empirical evidence shows that the major causes of depression are genuinely psychological causes of the symptoms of MDD. This rules out, in many cases, the “brute” causation required by the brain disease conception. The existence of cases of MDD with non-brute causes supports the reinstatement of the old nosological distinction between endogenous and exogenous depression.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

Medical technological advances have improved central nervous system monitoring in critically ill patients, allowing quick and reliable diagnosis neurologic dysfunction such as delirium, sensory processing deficits, seizures, and encephalopathy to name a few. A number of neurologic evaluation tools are available to assess the neurologic status of critically ill patients both acutely, as well as longterm. Each tool provides unique information regarding neurologic status and has associated strengths and weakness. Identification of neurologic dysfunction allows for the development of working plans for prognostication, therapeutics, and rehabilitation that address the needs of each ICU survivor. This review focuses on the evaluation of neurologic sequelae during critical illness and long-term neurologic outcomes in survivors of critical illness.

      "abstract": "Abstract As the information in Chapter 15 indicates, cognitive dysfunction and dementia are the most frequently recognized neurobehavioral syndromes encountered in patients with white matter disorders of the brain. In contrast, focal syndromes are relatively rare. Three major factors help explain these observations. First, the neuropathology involvement of most diseases and injuries of the white matter tends to be diffuse or multifocal, so that isolated lesions that might give rise to focal syndromes are relatively uncommon. Second, the neurobehavioral syndrome might occur only transiently and never come to clinical attention, and the patient recovers before a precise clinical-pathologic correlation can be made. Finally, focal syndromes, even when present, may be underappreciated because of the attention focused on other clinical and basic aspects of the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Introduction and aim Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a subtle but significant brain dysfunction resulting from chronic liver damage, with symptoms that can be difficult to detect. It affects patients' quality of life by causing problems with concentration, memory, and motor coordination. Untreated MHE may progress to more severe neurological disorders, such as overt hepatic encephalopathy. The importance of this condition lies in its impact on patients' daily functioning and the increased risk of accidents, particularly in situations requiring quick responses, such as driving.Neurological symptoms caused by the disease are potentially reversible with treatment. Materials and Methods Available literature from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was reviewed using the following keywords: \"minimal hepatic encephalopathy,\" \"hepatic encephalopathy,\" \"cirrhosis,\" and \"SIBO.\" Conclusion The significance of Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy is crucial from the perspective of preventing further progression and the onset of overt hepatic encephalopathy, as well as improving the quality of life for our patients. Patients and their families are often unaware of the condition, and the cognitive impairments are frequently underestimated. Enhancing diagnostic methods would enable physicians to identify these patients more promptly.",

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

Patients showed substantial neuropsychological deficits, fragmented nocturnal sleep and, in half the patients, sleep apnea and/or hypopnea both mainly of central type. There was no statistically significant correlation between the degree of daytime cognitive deficit and the degree of sleep fragmentation or of respiratory problems at night. It was concluded that the neuropsychological deficit in mytonic dystrophy cannot be attributed to a secondary effect of nocturnal sleep apnea or sleep disruption but probably represents a direct effect of CNS lesions.",

      "abstract": "Several cases of COVID-19-related mental disorders have emerged during the pandemic. In a case of femicide that occurred in Italy during the first phase of the pandemic, coinciding with a national lockdown, a discrepancy arose among forensic psychiatry experts, particularly toward the diagnosis of Brief Psychotic Disorder (BPD) related to COVID-19. We aimed to discuss the evaluation of the case through an integration of information and a literature review on comparable reported cases. An analysis of the diagnosis of brief acute psychosis was then performed, as well as a mini-review on cases of COVID-19-related psychosis. Results showed that psychotic symptomatology was characterized by polythematic delusions that always involved a SARS-CoV-2 infection. To a lesser extent, the delusions were accompanied by hallucinations, bizarre cognitive and associative alterations, insomnia, hyporexia, dysphoria, and suicidal behavior. No particularly violent acts with related injury or death of the victim were described. Finally, we could hypothesize that our case was better represented by a diagnosis of personality with predominantly narcissistic and partly psychopathic traits. The present case highlighted the importance, in the context of forensic psychiatry, of integrating assessments with the crime perpetrators, namely through accurate clinical interviews, neuropsychological tests, diachronic observations, and comparison with similar cases present in the literature. Such an integrated approach allows precise evaluation and reduces the odds of errors in a field, such as forensic psychiatry, where a diagnostic decision can be decisive in the judgment of criminal responsibility. Moreover, discerning forensics from health cases represents an important issue in risk management.",

      "abstract": "The fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) seems an unlikely candidate for classification as a neuropathic pain. The disorder is diagnosed based on a compatible history and the presence of multiple areas of musculoskeletal tenderness. A consistent pathology in either the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) has not been demonstrated in patients with FM, and they are not at higher risk for diseases of the CNS such as multiple sclerosis or of the peripheral nervous system such as peripheral neuropathy. A large proportion of FM sufferers have accompanying symptoms and signs of uncertain etiology, such as chronic fatigue, sleep disturbance, and bowel/bladder irritability. With the exception of migraine headaches and possibly irritable bowel syndrome, the accompanying disorders are clearly not neurological in origin. The impetus to classify the FM as a neuropathic pain comes from multiple lines of research suggesting widespread pain and tenderness are associated with chronic sensitization of the CNS. An examination of how the term neuropathic pain is defined reveals a conceptual split into 2 partially overlapping groups of disorders: those with demonstrable pathology in the nervous system and those characterized primarily by enduring dysfunction in the nervous system. Requiring demonstrable pathology in the nervous system in the definition of neuropathic pain is the traditional approach. The expansion of the definition to require only enduring nervous system dysfunction is less palatable because it opens the classification to many disorders of uncertain etiology, including complex regional pain syndrome. As it is uncertain which of the many different chronic pain syndromes include an enduring component of central sensitization, restricting the term \"neuropathic pain\" to those disorders with a primary etiology clearly related to the peripheral or CNS is prudent and consistent with clinical practice.",

These psychiatric conditions can broadly be classified either as primary, meaning the syndrome preceded the date of infection, or secondary, suggesting that the condition is directly or indirectly attributable to HIV itself, to cofactors associated with HIV infection, or to HIV treatments. The most prevalent primary disorders are mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder), alcohol and substance abuse (particularly abuse of injection drugs and stimulants), schizophrenia, and personality disorders. The most prevalent secondary conditions are mood syndromes (either depressive or manic) and deliria. Primary disorders may be associated with increased risk of infection, whereas both primary and secondary disorders may impact life-quality, functioning, medical compliance, and perhaps survival.",
