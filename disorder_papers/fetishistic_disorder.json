      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‐11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Normal sexual function is a bio-psycho-social process which is significantly related to the quality of life (QOL). Any disturbance in one of the components can be a disaster in sexual life. Erectile dysfunction is a disability to get an erection or to maintain the erection well enough for a sexual intercourse, which persists or recurs at least three months conse-cutively due to either psychogenic or organic disturbances, or both. Some psychogenic dis-turbances especially depression, anxiety, and relational distress, play some important roles in ED. Besides that, aging, low testoteron level, physical diseases, and some certain medicines have to be included. Key words: erection, erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulus, depression. Abstract: Fungsi seksual yang normal merupakan suatu proses biopsikososial yang berkaitan langsung dengan kualitas hidup. Adanya gangguan pada salah satu komponen dapat menjadi malapetaka bagi kehidupan seksual. Disfungsi ereksi dapat dedefinisikan sebagai suatu keti-dakmampuan untuk ereksi atau mempertahankan ereksi yang cukup untuk melakukan hu-bungan seksual yang memuaskan, yang menetap atau berulang paling tidak selama tiga bulan berturut-turut. Gangguan psikogenik khususnya sindroma depresi, ankietas, dan distres relasional berperan penting dalam hal terjadinya disfungsi ereksi. Disamping itu usia lanjut, rendahnya kadar testoteron, penyakit fisik, dan beberapa jenis obat perlu diperhitungkan. Kata kunci: fisiologi ereksi, disfungsi ereksi, stimulus seksual, depresi.",

      "title": "Addiction sexuelle ou hypersexualité : 2 termes différents pour une même pathologie ?",
      "abstract": "L’addiction sexuelle débute à l’âge adulte jeune avec un ratio hommes/femmes variant de 2 à 5/1. Le nombre de consultation pour ce motif a augmenté en France mais à ce jour, aucune étude épidémiologique n’a été menée. Différents facteurs déclenchent le comportement addictif sexuel (émotions positives, négatives, circonstances environnementales). La consommation sexuelle est excessive et concerne différents supports sexuels. Il y a au moins un orgasme quotidien pendant au moins 6 mois mais celui-ci s’accompagne toujours d’une perte contrôle, d’une perte de temps à préparer le comportement, le réaliser ou à récupérer de ses effets. Les patients dépendants au sexe se construisent une deuxième vie et sont dans la crainte permanente que cette vie, toujours dissociée de l’amour, soit découverte. La réalisation fréquente du comportement sexuel addictif altère les obligations professionnelles, familiales ou sociales. La notion de trouble hypersexualité repose sur des critères cliniques suffisamment fréquents et intenses pour entraîner des altérations du fonctionnement personnel et social sur une période d’au moins 6 mois : perte de temps ; comportements répétitifs, réalisés en réponse à un état dépressif, anxieux, à un ennui, à des événements de vie stressants ; difficultés répétées pour contrôler ou réduire de manière significative des fantasmes/envies/activités sexuelles ; engagement répétitif dans des activités sexuelles en dépit du risque de conséquences physiques ou émotionnelles pour soi ou pour les autres ; fréquence et intensité importantes des comportements sexuels. Il existe différentes formes cliniques qui sont la masturbation compulsive, la consommation compulsive de pornographie, le cybersexe, les conversations érotiques au téléphone, la fréquentation compulsive de clubs, et la séduction compulsive. Les complications de cette pathologie peuvent être d’ordre somatique, psychologique et social. La prise en charge doit être intégrée et multimodale en combinant thérapie cognitive et comportementale, soutien, approche pharmacologique, thérapie de couple et groupes d’auto-support.",

Legal definitions distinguish between quid pro quo sexual harassment, where putting up with these behaviors is a condition of work, and behaviors that create an intimidating, offensive, hostile environment for the victim. Its forms can be physical, verbal, gestural, visual, or graphic. Behaviors that can be perceived as sexual harassment include unwelcome (sexual) jokes, remarks with sexual connotations or about private lives, gossip, repeated requests to go out, and any form of unwanted touching or invasion of personal space, as well as sexual advances or assault.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Child sexual abuse is typically defined as any sort of sexual contact between a child and an adult (or significantly older teenager), including sexual solicitation of, or exposure to, a child by an older person. It may include unwanted and inappropriate physical contact with the child's genitals; sexual touching, manipulation, or fondling; penetration in terms of vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse or attempted intercourse; as well as exposing children to sexual images or forcing them to watch pornography or to witness adult sexual acts. Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‐term psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‐esteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

The physiological sexual response depends not only on intact vascular, endocrine and neurological pathways, but also on sensory input. During sexual penetration the vagina lengthens, the labia increase in fullness, the uterus draws back and the clitoris retracts. In a population-based survey, vaginismus was seen in 6 percent of the 37.9 percent of women who reported sexual problems. Primary vaginismus is diagnosed when nothing has ever entered the vagina. Secondary vaginismus occurs often after vulvovaginal trauma such as infection, childbirth, malignancy or its treatment, or sexual trauma such as rape or abuse. Dyspareunia is pain on sexual intercourse. This applies to any form of sexual vaginal penetration, not only with the penis, but other objects such as fingers or sex toys.",

Focus in fetishism is on sexual objects closely related to the human body (shoes, gloves, stockings, slippers, etc.). This case chooses the human ejaculate different from those objects used often. Moreover, he cannot help himself from spreading it, which is bought from young men, on his genital area.

      "abstract": "Considerable ambiguity surrounds both scientific and popular attempts to define the term “late‐life sexuality.” Agreement as to when “late life” begins increasingly has moved upward over the last century with the lengthening of the average life course in most industrial societies. Meanwhile, the term “sexuality” has come to connote a wide variety of human sociobiological responses that range from varying levels of social attraction or physiological arousal to intimate body contact that may or may not include physical penetration. The failure of research scientists to define what they mean by “sexuality,” “sexual behavior,” or “late life” when designing studies or publishing their results complicates attempts to compare research findings within older age groups and across societies and sociocultural environments. Still, at least five themes emerge as constant premises in the literature concerning sexual desire and activity in later life as defined by some form of mental and/or physical sexual response at age 50 or older.",

      "title": "Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual desire is typically viewed as an interest in sexual objects or activities. Although sexual desire is often confused with sex drive, these are fundamentally different constructs. Whereas sex drive represents a basic, biologically mediated motivation to seek out sexual activity and/or sexual gratification (and hence is traitlike in nature), sexual desire is a specific state of sexual interest that typically has a specific target and/or trigger. Sexual desire can be elicited by a large variety of cues and situations, private thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, erotic materials (such as books, movies, photographs), and a variety of erotic environments, situations, or social interactions. Researchers have increasingly come to acknowledge that there are different forms of sexual desire. One useful distinction, first advanced in the context of research on nonhuman primates, is that between proceptivity and receptivity. Proceptivity refers to a basic urge to seek out and initiate sexual activity and is regulated by gonadal hormones (e.g., testosterone in men and estrogen in women). Receptivity, sometimes called arousability, represents the capacity to become sexually interested or aroused upon exposure to certain environmental or situational stimuli. Unlike proceptivity, arousability is not hormone‐dependent; in fact, even individuals with no circulating gonadal hormones show arousability to erotic stimuli, although they are not typically motivated to seek out sexual gratification.",

      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses.

The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "title": "Female sexual dysfunction",
      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in the context of sexuality, excludes the mere absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. Thus a woman’s sexual function encompasses many areas; the construct of a normal function as a quality of life indicator often but not always conforms to the sexual response cycle, which is an endogenous process contributed by hormonal, vascular, neuronal, and psycho-emotional factors. Clinical and scientific evidence abounds about the physiological role of sex steroids viz. oestrogen, testosterone, and also progesterone in facilitating and maintaining the woman’s sexual parameters. The neurophysiology extends from the central and peripheral nervous systems to the targeted genital structures resulting in coordinated vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle relaxation, to be accompanied by pelvic vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication, and labial and clitoral engorgement. Any detrimental impact on this normal cycle of concerted responses can result in a functional impairment or ‘female sexual dysfunction’ (FSD). Sexual changes, psychogenic or organic, are common in women at any age; such complaints are frequently accompanied by quality-of-life concerns, varying levels of personal distress, anxiety, depression, and also fertility concerns in younger women. With FSD as a medically diagnosable entity, fewer drugs have met the safety and efficacy criteria for global approval and clinical utility. In order to appreciate the diverse range of FSD and the extent of its physical, physiological, and psychological implications, it is important to understand the fundamentals as well as the changing paradigms in a woman’s sexual functioning.",

      "title": "Primary femininity.",
      "abstract": "In Freud's theory of the origins of femininity in females, there is a stage unaccounted for in the chronology of the little girl's development: the first many months of life are not considered. We know by now that castration anxiety, penis envy, and the traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair. The factors that make up this stage, with examples, are reviewed: (1) a biological \"force\": the effect of circulating fetal sex hormones on the brain of the fetus; (2) sex assignment: the announcement at the time of birth to the parents that they have had a boy or a girl (or a hermaphrodite); (3) parental attitudes: the effects of the sex assignment on parents, then reflected back onto the infant; (4) \"biopsychic\" phenomena: early postnatal effects caused by certain habitual patterns of handling the infant-conditioning, imprinting(?), or other forms of nonconflictual learning; (5) developing body ego: sensations, especially from the genitals, that define the child's dimensions. I suggest that one can divide the development of femininity in females into two phases, both of which lead to adult femininity, but each of which contributes in a different manner. The first, nonconflictual in origin, contributes a sense of femaleness and some of what allows for one's looking feminine; the second, the result of conflict, especially oedipal, produces a richer and more complicated femininity, not merely one of appearances, but one enriched by desires to perform with the substance, rather than just the façade, of femininity.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN La creación de un estoma intestinal representa mucho más que un procedimiento quirúrgico funcional; constituye una transformación profunda que involucra la identidad corporal, esfera emocional, sexualidad y vida social del paciente. El impacto emocional puede ser profundo, y muchas veces subestimado por los equipos de salud, afectando la calidad de vida y el proceso de recuperación del paciente. En muchos casos, los pacientes reportan sentimientos de despersonalización y pérdida del atractivo físico, lo cual afecta su autoestima y sus relaciones interpersonales. Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de síntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirugía de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptación es también común, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentación, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo físico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminución del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones íntimas. Así mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en público. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta clínica que trascienda lo técnico y abrace la dimensión humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucción de la identidad psicológica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, será posible favorecer una adaptación saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena más allá de la ostomía.

Sexuality in fact includes the physiological, behavioural and relational aspects of human sexual life, which are variously influenced by psychological factors (e.g. sexual fantasies, desire, arousal, psychosexual orientation, and the choice of the sexual object), as well as social and organic (vascular, nervous, and endocrine) factors. From a functional point of view, a normal penile erection may be defined as an erection which permits the penetration of a lubricated vagina without additional assistance. Concerning the erectile mechanism, the haemodynamic changes in the penis require a high degree of central and peripheral nervous coordinated control and an unaffected endocrine system.",

      "title": "[Hypothesis of the pathology of mediation in surgery (3)].",
      "abstract": "There are three aspects to mediation: the first of these is purely physiological, or rather is concerned with performance of service functions such as ovulation, sexual activity, sleep, etc.; the second, strictly speaking, may be defined as pathophysiological, as its starting point is considered to be an aggressive event, even when a routine occurrence (in the stomach, for instance, aggression is a constant feature, even when of only slight intensity, as produced by the physical characteristics of the enormous quantities of food transiting the stomach and by particular environmental conditions; the third aspect is distinctly pathological, in that it constitutes the basis for the aggravation of a pathological situation already in progress, sometimes according to the logic of plain addition, but more often according to a more catastrophic process of multiplication (less frequently it takes the form of induction of a prevalent or independent disease condition). This break-down of mediation into distinct types, though necessary from the point of view of academic classification, proves extremely difficult to apply in practice. The validity of this latter consideration obviously depends on the specific area we are tackling. As regards the sex glands and male genital organ, the service role is unquestionable; elsewhere, we can be equally sure that we faced with pathophysiological aspects. In the stomach, for example, the difference between \"normality\" and \"disease\" does not lie so much in the absence, as opposed to the presence, of lesions, but rather in their extent and duration. This makes it extremely difficult to draw the line between physiology and pathology, and at the same time suggests that the state of health may be an unstable equilibrium phase somewhere midway between divergent forces belonging to the same mechanism. This latter mechanism may therefore be the key factor both in vital performance and in disease processes, whereas the \"classic\" aetiological factor may actually be relegated to a secondary role, at least in most cases.",

Effects of sexual music videos on viewers' gender schemasResearch suggests that music videos with sexual content have an effect on viewers' attitudes towards gender roles, including gender roles in the context of a sexual relationship [11,7,5].These findings are explained by two theories of cognition, namely, the Social Learning Theory and the Priming Theory.The Social Learning Theory claims that individuals learn from modeled behaviors [12].In this view, the repetition of stereotyped depictions of men and women in the media help shape children's gender schemas, leading children to perceive masculinity and femininity in more traditional and rigid ways [13].Priming may also play a role in how viewers perceive the sexual content of a music video.According to Priming Theory, different stimuli activate different schemas, or blueprints of a construct, which can influence cognition or behavior [14].If audiences consider music videos to be a heavily sexualized media overall, or a particular artist to have a hypersexual persona, they may view individual videos with sex-related schemas already Identifying sexual content in music videosResearch has shown that music video imagery has often been",

      "abstract": "Abstract The complexities of women's sexual response preclude useful management strategies which are modelled only on the traditional human sex response cycle beginning with sexual desire rather than other motivations. Both biological and psychological parameters affecting women's sexual motivation and arousability can be depicted in alternative models. These reflect that motivations to begin a sexual experience, although varied, are most often intimacy-based in women. The key role of subjective sexual arousal, which often precedes and then accompanies sexual desire, is clarified. A positive outcome emotionally and physically is necessary to achieve the original goal of enhancing emotional closeness, sense of being attracted and attractive, committed, loved—together with the goal (accessed en route) of sexual satisfaction. Innate, spontaneous desire may only occasionally augment the intimacy-based motivation. Thus therapy for 'desire disorders' may more profitably focus on the woman's problematic motivation, inadequate sexual stimuli and context, diminished arousability and/or unsatisfactory outcome to an experience. A model of subjective sexual arousal reflects the ongoing affective and cognitive modulation and variable input from physical genital congestion. Awareness of the poor correlation between genital vasocongestion and the subjective experience allows subtyping of arousal problems in order to facilitate their management.",

Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

In addition, there are three general categories of difficulties: disorders of desire, disorders of arousal, and difficulty attaining orgasm. Many medications, including psychoactive medications, can affect sexual appetite and/or sexual performance significantly. Healthcare professionals should look up the possible sexual side effects of each medication that a patient is taking. The evaluation of an individual with sexual problems requires a sophisticated integration of knowledge from many areas, as biological, psychological, and social forces all strongly influence sexual functioning.

Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology.

      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment—almost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

The following disorders make up the new DSM-5 category of sexual dysfunctions: delayed ejaculation, erectile disorder, female orgasmic disorder, female sexual interest/arousal disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejaculation, substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual dysfunction, and unspecified sexual dysfunction. The five factors to be considered in addition to the criteria for a diagnosis of a sexual dysfunction include: partner factors—health status, any sexual dysfunctions; relationship factors—communication patterns, discrepancies in sexual desires; individual vulnerability factors—prior sexual trauma, poor body image, comorbid disorders, or emotional stressors; cultural or religious factors—attitudes or inhibitions toward sexuality; and medical factors—relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

The first type may be illustrated by TV soap operas or movies in which some of the scenes, although typically not a majority, include references to or actual portrayals of sexual interactions. Although varying in degree of sexual explicitness, these portrayals typically do not show explicit sexual acts or aroused genitals. Nor is the primary apparent purpose of the material that of continuous sexual stimulation and consequent arousal. The second category, typically referred to as “pornography,” or “sexually explicit material,” is primarily intended to sexually arouse the consumer and contains mostly sexual content with explicit sexual acts.",

People with low overall trait self-control and/or whose self-control strength had been depleted by recent, nonsexual acts were less likely than other people to stifle inappropriate sexual thoughts and to resist the temptation to engage in sexual activities with someone other than their primary relationship partner. They also engaged in more extensive sexual activity in the laboratory with their dating partner and they reported more undercontrolled or impulsive sexual behavior generally. Furthermore, there was some evidence that the effects of diminished self-control were strongest among those with the strongest sexual desires (men and sexually unrestricted individuals) and among couples with less sexual experience.",

Verringert sich auch mit zunehmendem Alter der Anteil derjenigen, die noch Geschlechtsverkehr ausüben, so bestehen neben anderen Praktiken (Selbstbefriedigung) weiterhin sexuelle Fantasien und Wünsche. Männer sind meist länger sexuell aktiv als Frauen. In Partnerschaften besteht eine größere sexuelle Aktivität als bei Alleinlebenden. Deutlich ist die Veränderung vom Geschlechtsverkehr hin zu Zärtlichkeit, Vertrauen und erfüllter Beziehung.Zahlreiche körperliche, psychische und soziale Faktoren beeinflussen die Sexualität im Alter. Bedeutsam sind die physiologischen Veränderungen und deren Auswirkungen beim Altern. Vielfältige Erkrankungen, Medikamente und Folgen von Operationen (reale oder mit Angst besetzte) erschweren oder verunmöglichen eine sexuelle Aktivität.Tauchen im ärztlichen Gespräch Hinweise auf eine sexuelle Problematik auf, so gilt es diese vorurteilsfrei aufzugreifen, abzuklären und nach Lösungsmöglichkeiten zu suchen. Häufig ist diese Problematik Symptom einer psychischen oder funktionellen Störung, die durch Beratungsgespräche oder eine gezielte Psychotherapie behandelt werden kann.",

Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

The intimate reciprocal relations of the brain, or cerebral centers, and the prostate gland are marked, both in health and in disease. In health, excessive mental taxation, as by study or business cares, will lessen the sexual appetite; while violent emotions, such as grief, fright or anxiety, will temporarily suspend all desire.

      "abstract": "Sexuality is a basic need of every human being. However, it can somrtimes become deviant. Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

However it occurs often in dynamically developing firms that ethical norms are not kept and this process is observed by lack of equal chances to get a job – people without connections remain without work. Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenceless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behaviour, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

      "abstract": "Sex assignment of children born with ambiguous genitalia is a difficult and responsible decision based on limited empirical evidence regarding future development of gender identity/role, sexual orientation, and sexual functioning. Sex of assignment and rearing has appeared to be a prognosticator of future gender identity, usually better than the other criteria of sex (chromosomes, gonadal tissue, prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles). The decision to assign a sex is guided by the prognosis of the ``optimal'' sex for the newborn, of which the elements are an overall sex-appropriate appearance with a stable gender identity; good sexual function, preferably combined with reproductive function if attainable; minimal medical procedures; and a reasonably happy life given the limitations. The limited follow-up studies indicate that this is a reasonable policy, although a limited number of subjects will experience gender dysphoria later in life and will cross over to the other sex. This is more often the case in subjects assigned to the female sex with considerable prenatal or postnatal androgen exposure. Children in this predicament must receive guidance well into adulthood. It may be difficult to engage in sexual relations when the anatomy of the genitalia (often operated upon) is not fully normal.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Sexual Deviance",
      "abstract": "There is one topic that is guaranteed to polarise any group that discusses it, and that is sex. The perception of what is sexually perverted shifts dependent on who is talking about it. A person’s profession, gender, age, race, proclivities, education and even which century they live in, have all effected the viewpoint on sex and sexual perversions. For example, homosexuality has long been stigmatised as sexually perverted, (and remains so among some portions of society), but psychological and medical professionals no longer consider it pathological. Even the term perversion is controversial. Psychologists generally refer to non-traditional sexual behaviour as sexual deviation or, in cases where the specific object of arousal is unusual, as paraphilia. There are a number of clinically recognised disorders of sexual or paraphiliac function, including fetishism (the object of sexual desire is either an inanimate object or a non-genital part of the human anatomy), voyeurism (the covert viewing of other individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaged in sexual activity) and chronophilia (the primary sexual attraction is to a particular age group). Many of these behaviours are punishable by law. Although rape is not classified as a paraphilia, it is a serious sexual deviance, and perhaps the most highly reviled form of sexual gratification. \r\nThis lecture will explore forms of sexual deviance and sexual violence that come to the attention of forensic psychology, and outline the psychological theories that attempt to explain why some people find sexual gratification in unusual and illegal ways. You may be surprised at the ways in which the law impinges upon sex.",

In these ways it can be recognised as a precursor of the disturbances of sexuality which have been more commonly studied as manifestations of adult emotional life. From the beginning of life physiological growth and functioning can be seen as interrelating with the growth of personality, sensory and sensual experience with infantile 'pre-genital' sexuality, and all linking in many complex ways with the development of character traits and personal relationships. Whereas infantile sexuality is characterised as being experimental and imitative in terms of phantasies about the parental relationship, and predominantly masturbatory in aim, adult sexuality is envisaged as essentially creative and reciprocal.",

      "title": "Section I: General Aspects",
      "abstract": "Normal male sexual function depends on the sexual response cycle, which consists of an anticipatory libidinous state (sexual motive or desire), effective vasocongestive arousal (erection), orgasm, and resolution (detumescence). Libido is defined as the biological need for sexual activity and frequently is expressed as sexseeking behavior. Its intensity is variable between individuals as well as within an individual over a given period of time. Little is known about the physiological basis of libido. Erection, however, is associated with significant psychological and physical changes. This is the ultimate response to multiple psychogenic and sensory stimuli from imaginative, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and genital reflexogenic sources, which trigger several neurological and vascular cascades that produce penile tumescence and rigidity sufficient for vaginal penetration. The sensation of orgasm is accompanied by two sequential functions: emission and ejaculation. Emission, mediated by contractions of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and urethra, produces a sensation of ejaculatory inevitability and deposition of semen in the posterior urethra. Generalized muscular tension, perineal contractions, and involuntary pelvic thrusting (every 0.8 seconds) usually follow and lead to the expulsion of semen from the urethral meatus. The resolution phase returns the penis to the flaccid state and provides a sense of general pleasure, well-being, and muscular relaxation. During this period, men are physiologically refractory to subsequent erection and orgasm for a variable amount of time. (For further information on normal male sex physiology, see Chapter 3.)Disorders of the sexual response may involve one or more of the cycle’s phases; these may be generalized or limited to certain situations or partners or may be lifelong (i.e., there has been no evidence of any effective sexual performance, generally due to persistent intrapsychic conflicts) or acquired (dysfunction arises after a period of normal function). Although there are no universally acknowledged defining criteria, a period of persistence over three months has been suggested as areasonable guideline for clinical concern. Isolated dysfunction of the erectile mechanism is the most common problem, but generally, disturbances may occur in some or all of the subjective components of desire, arousal, and pleasure and the objective components of performance, vasocongestion, and orgasm, although any of these may be affected independently.",

      "abstract": "The central premise is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In those ways, they are like more ordinary sexual preferences, generating sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect. Increase of sexual demands is rare and many behaviors considered as inappropriate or expressing hypersexuality actually express affective needs or result from cognitive disturbances. Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families.

      "abstract": "Masturbation is a topic of discussion among all the categories of people since ancient times. Masturbation refers to non-penetrative sexual stimulation of a person’s genitals, often to the point of orgasm. The stimulation can be performed manually, by other types of bodily contact (short of sexual contact), by use of objects or tools, or by some combination of these methods. Masturbatory habits amounting to masturbatory abnormalities are included in the Chapter V (F 65.8) of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems -10 under “Other disorders of sexual preference”. In later 1700, a forged association was made between masturbation and mental illness. Masturbation served for decades as catch all diagnosis for all types of medical complaints of uncertain etiology. During the late 19th century, investigations in psychology and sexology made it clear that masturbation is nearly universal. In Sanskrit, semen is known as ‘DHAT’; and in Susruta Samhita the disorder related to loss of this DHAT has been mentioned as ‘Shukrameha’ and also known as Dhat Syndrome. Kissing, masturbation and intercourse are the frequent sexual activities among adults. Even after a permanent sexual relationship has been established, masturbation remains as a healthy practice during the illness or absence of partner or when intercourse is unsatisfactory. In older age group Involuntary Masturbation may be a manifestation of stroke related Alien Hand Syndrome. Today, masturbatory act is considered as a healthy practice when done in private and an offence if done in the public in most of the countries.",

Sociosexual behavior takes place between individuals of various combinations of ages and sexes. In some species such as bonobos, sociosexual activity starts in infancy and can occur as many as 30 times a day, while in other species like chimpanzees, it starts later in life and is less frequent. Sociosexual behavior can take the form of sexual competition—competition between members of the same sex for a mate in the form of fighting or even blocking ovulation in less‐dominant individuals. Sociosexuality is interpreted as strengthening relationships, acts of dominance, reparation after fights, and reducing tension. Most data on nonhuman primate sociosexuality indicate that behaviors occurring outside of reproduction may increase future matings and/or reproductive success.",

Erotism is human sexuality freed of any project of reproduction, any compulsory genitality. It enables enjoyment to be independent of any biological function and makes it autonomous in such a way that all pleasure in eating, drinking, or working will arouse the suspicion of a hidden erotism.",

      "abstract": "Sexual disorders and/or problems are exceedingly common and they significantly affect a patient's quality of life. Sexual health problems can be caused by an ongoing illness, medication use, past surgery and/or relationship issues. The WHO has defined 'sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well being in relation to sexuality and it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity' [1]. Good sexual health comprises an absence of sexually transmitted disease (STD), fertility problems and unwanted pregnancies and also the ability to enjoy one's sexuality without abuse and/or oppression [1]. The topic of sex and sexuality in itself is now no longer confined to hushed discussions in the twenty-first century. Yet, there is still anxiety and abstinence when the topic of sex comes up for discussion, especially more so between the clinician and the patient [2, 3]. This leaves a tremendous void in the delivery of complete holistic healthcare.",

      "title": "Queering Performativity: Disability after Deleuze",
      "abstract": "In this paper I want to address the question of what it means to be a sexual subject, primarily as a matter of theory, but always keeping in mind the implications of that project for a set of material parameters that concern the notion of human flourishing. Given that for any postmodernist analysis the complex issue of sexual subjectivity is always open to question and uncertainty, then to read the specific problematic, as I intend, through the field of disability, where sexuality has scarcely been theorised at all, is even more troubling. The widespread western uneasiness in acknowledging or even recognising erotic desire, an uneasiness that can be seen at play in the attempted effacement of childhood sexuality, or in the consignment of older people to a sexual limbo, is most clearly mobilised where the form of embodiment itself contests, either deliberatively or accidentally, the standards of normative corporeality. Whether the body in question has been intentionally transformed as in transsexual surgery or enhanced by body-building drug regimes, or has suffered severe trauma such as amputation or spinal injury, then the attributions of sexual desire and practice are likely to invoke discomfort and confusion. Even more disturbing, however, to the point of denial of any sexuality at all are those modes of embodiment that are both radically anomalous and resistant either projectively or retrospectively to normative recuperation. The category of congenital or early onset disability is surely paradigmatic in that its exclusion from the very notion of sexual subjectivity is so unproblematised that it is taken almost as a natural fact. It is not necessary to re-essentialise sexuality, however, in order to contest the exclusionary violence of such a view. Following the phenomenological path taken by Foucault and Butler, it?s clear that what is at stake lies in the performitivity of sexuality, not as a potentially pleasurable bonus, but as a core element of self-becoming that infuses all aspects of the materiality of living in the world. As Merleau-Ponty (1963) suggests, sexuality is, quite simply, a modality of existence.",

      "abstract": "The concept of sexual harassment, in its modern understanding, is a relatively new one, dating from the 1970s onwards; although other related concepts have existed prior to this in many cultures. “Sexual Harassment” means behavior, including physical contact, advances, and comments in person, through an intermediary, and/or via phone, text message, email, social media, or other electronic medium, that is unwelcome; based on sex or gender stereotypes; and is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with a person's academic performance, employment or equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from college or University programs or activities or by creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working or educational environment. Students at academic institutions often sexually harass others by calling them “fag, ” “homo, ” “Hey, babe, ” “Hot stuff, ” or “Big stud” or other degrading terms that refer to sexual orientation. Additional types of sexual harassment include students starting or spreading sexual rumors, writing sexual graffiti on bathroom walls, sending crude e-mails or letters, and displaying sexual drawings or pornography. A person in a position of power may request sexual favors in return for a starting position on a college team, a higher grade, or access to a popular club or peer group. Individuals who experience sexual harassment feel fearful, intimidated, manipulated, and overpowered.",

      "abstract": "Sexual harassment refers to any unwanted or unwelcomed conduct of a sexual\r\nnature either by verbal, non-verbal, visual, psychological or physical harassment. As\r\nsexual harassment violates an individual's fundamental rights, the perpetrator may\r\nbe subject to criminal prosecution besides a range of disciplinary measures, up to and\r\nincluding dismissal from employment. Further, such ojfensive conduct has the\r\ntendency of creating an intimidating, hostile and ojfensive work environment\r\nwhich can adversely affect the industrial relations climate in the organisation.\r\nSexual harassment comes within the ambit of gender discrimination. In quid pro\r\nquo harassment, a tangible loss is involved where the superior with authority to\r\napprove job assignment, evaluation and benefits, solicits sexual favours as a\r\nprerequisite of getting such benefits. If the unfavourable treatment was due to the\r\nemployee's refusal to accede to the sexual demands, it may well fall within the scope\r\nof the gender discrimination. Similarly, terminating the victim's employment\r\ncontract merely because the victim could not withstand the conducts of sexual\r\nharassment at the workplace comes also within the scope of gender discrimination.\r\nHence, the issue of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the context of\r\nMalaysian law and practice forms the basis of this paper.",

And yet, with rare exceptions, the area of erotic transference/countertransference in the treatment of adolescents is largely ignored in analytic writing. The catastrophic prospect of boundary violations, particularly with minors, can lead to a timid avoidance of the erotic in the work with adolescents, yielding is term as ‘erotic insufficiency’. The body of the adolescent is changing radically before his or her own, as well as the eyes. The emerging bodily experiences of the adolescent (first menstruation, first wet dream, first masturbation to orgasm, etc.) are parts of a ‘virgin territory’. Timid avoidance of erotic feelings in the consulting room deprives adolescents of sincere adult thinking in relation to allowing and managing sexual feelings.",

      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

However, psychosocial and relational factors play a major role in sexual dysfunctions generally and at this age of the \"empty nest\" and a doctor-patient relationship based on trust may well help in coping with them. Finally, a (new?) understanding of genital sexuality as a concise body-language or literally an incarnation of the relationship is advocated and may add a new dimension and quality to a couple's sex life.",

Examples of the same sort of phenomena described by Kluft are repeatedly observed in therapy with members of this population, but usually not in a dramatic form. As might be anticipated, in order to survive, when an individual is closely attached to a long-term and extreme abuser, the sort of enduring ambivalence carried by the victim towards their primary abuser is manifested in compartmentalized states that wish their abuser dead, while other states in equally compartmentalized ways maintain the attachment via the use of sex-by continuing to be sexually involved with their primary abuser (usually their father), by fantasizing about sex with their abuser, by being sexually involved with those who co-abused with their father, or by staging reenactments with individuals whose sexual behavior re-evokes the abuse by the absent (or deceased) father. The process of healing means that inevitably some manifestations of the responses to such abuse spill over into therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction has become the catch-all for infidelity, cheating, promiscuity, and rape. Recently it has become the newest claim for rapists and child molesters. Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

      "title": "Human trafficking as a form of organized crime: Main phenomenological features",
      "abstract": "Human trafficking is a complex socio-pathological phenomenon based on (historical) institutions of slavery and exploitation, i.e. on treating a man as goods or a thing, in order to exploit his labor power, knowledge and skills, bodily and sexual integrity in order to satisfy one's own or someone else's instinct, health or emotional needs or in order to gain direct or indirect material profit for oneself or somebody else. Certain forms of slavery and exploitation of persons known from ancient times can be seen today in identical form (public selling of victims, working exploitation in agricultural and home sector, sexual exploitation, forced participation in armed conflicts) or in modified forms (working exploitation in industrial sector, illegal adoption), and there are completely new forms (trafficking in bodily organs or parts, performing medical experiments, forced pregnancy, and similar). On the other hand, manifesting forms of trafficking do not differ in practice from some other similar phenomena primarily smuggling of migrants, prostitution and work of illegal migrants in so-called black economy sector. This is why it has been pointed to the main features of this phenomenon. The conclusion is that trafficking is a multi-manifesting phenomenon, and this is why it is very difficult to come to a comprehensive, generally accepted classification of its manifesting forms. The offered classification of forms of trafficking according to the degree of social danger, geographical level of implementation, physical and biological characteristics of victims and relation of victim to his/her position, in principle, does not exclude the possibility of some other classification. The cases of trafficking in practice can almost always be identified as some of possible combination of previously mentioned forms and types. In addition to being a multi-manifesting, trafficking is also a multi-structural phenomenon. The process of its realization, in principle, consists of four stages with many sub-stages within each of them. The dominant moments in realization of trafficking are certainly recruiting of victims, their transport, exploitation and elimination. Finally, trafficking is exceptionally developed and represented activity of organized criminal groups, more and more oft en transnational in scope. Excessive demand for sexual services increased the excessive demand for the victims of trafficking, but also the division of jobs among criminal organizations, their specialization and tendency to create monopole position at human market, which is more and more characterized by marketing, work of agencies, rules of business operations and other epithets of modern economic management. There are huge possibilities of profit since the victims can be exploited in many various ways. The knowledge of the main characteristics of certain forms of trafficking is an important condition to identify these complex and dynamic phenomena in practice, then to distinguish the trafficking from other similar security problems as well as to identify active and passive subjects in trafficking.",

      "abstract": "Sexual deviations are disorders in which the individual has fantasies, sexual desires or behaviors that are repetitive and sexually provocative and often include inhumane issues for at least 6 months. Since these people   usually make various legal problems for both themselves and others, this disorder is of special interest. Different models have discussed on the etiology of sexual deviations among of which the special psychoanalysis of Freud have investigated this disorder more comprehensively. In Freudian’s psychoanalysis, sexual deviation has a neurosis structure and shows that sexual deviated has in fact accepted the deprivation of the mother,  but is still trying to return to the bosom of the mother and the denying father. Also, in self-psychology the sexual deviant who has had wrong repeating scenarios in regards to his/hers relationship with parents or as a sadistic seeks to create a temporary and false glorious sense of confidence, to create  a   grandiose self who is self- sufficient and does not need anyone. In many cases body organ justifications are also considered for sexual deviations. Among the examined patients in psychiatric clinics, 74% had hormone level disorders,  27% had neurologic symptoms, 24%, had chromosomal disorders, 9%  had epilepsy, 4% had abnormal EEG, 4% had major psychiatric disorders  , and 4% had mental retardation .Some sources propose 9 identifications for sexual deviation which include: Fetishism, Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Sexual Masochism, Sexual Sadism, Transvestic fetishism, Frotteurism and Paraphilias. The treatment of sexual deviations has great complexity due to its coincidnce with psychiatric disorders such as personality disorders, as well as other factors such as the patients’ shame and modesty and not stating their problems. The treatment of sexual deviation is considered to have four general purposes including a) reducing sexual desires b) giving insight and understanding to the patient c) controlling external stimuli d) treating concurrent disorders.The treatment of sexual deviation involves extensive ranges of biological therapies to mental therapies.  One of the major approaches to psychotherapy in the treatment of sexual deviations is the insight oriented approach that causes a person to improve his interpersonal skills and to find an acceptable method for sexual gratification. Treatment in groups through specific procedures and guidelines and practices can also help the patients. When a person has other psychiatric disorders, pharmacotherapy can treat concurrent biological problems of the individual as well as reducing sexual and obsessive desires. In rare cases where the problem is very serious or causes legal conflicts, surgical treatment is recommended. Keywords: Review, Paraphilias,  Transvestic, Justice, Frotteurism",

Analyses of sex and gender in the social sciences, though less likely to accept uncritically the naive biological determinism of the view just presented, often retain a conception of sex-linked behaviors and traits as essential properties of individuals. Gender may be routinely fashioned in a variety of situations that seem conventionally expressive to begin with, such as those that present “helpless” women next to heavy objects or flat tires. Many situations are not clearly sex categorized to begin with, nor is what transpires within them obviously gender relevant. Subsequently, little boys appropriate the gender ideal of “efficaciousness,” that is, being able to affect the physical and social environment through the exercise of physical strength or appropriate skills. Thus gender differences, or the sociocultural shaping of “essential female arid male natures,” achieve the status of objective facts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This species represents a typical example of protandric consecutive sexuality, the male phase becoming functional at a very early age, when the body has reached a length of only 3 to 7 mm. Those males which become functional earliest usually seek the association of older individuals in the female phase; others, maturing later, are more likely to remain solitary. Mated males have accentuated masculine characteristics and retain the male phase longer than solitary individuals or those that are isolated experimentally. Unfavorable environmental conditions postpone or prevent functional sexuality and terminate the male phase promptly without inaugurating the female phase. The influence of the female in accentuating the sexuality of the male is thought to be due to stimuli received by the latter through sense organs in tentacles and penis and mediated by the nervous system through hormonal secretions. Termination of the male phase and transition to the functional female are comparable to metamorphosis from the immature to the mature condition in other animals and, like metamorphosis, the primary (male) sexual phase can be abbreviated or prolonged experimentally, but the sequence cannot be reversed.",

Theories of sexual addiction suggest that these individuals regulate their emotions poorly, as evidenced by coactivation of positive and negative emotions during sexual stimulation. Men and women who either reported problems down-regulating their use of VSS (VSS-P, N = 71) or no problem regulating use of VSS (VSS-C, N = 49) watched a neutral film and a sexual film. They reported their positive and negative feelings after each film. Unexpectedly, the VSS-P group exhibited significantly less coactivation of positive and negative affect to the sexual film than VSS-C. This is inconsistent with emotion dysregulation, supposedly a key feature of “hypersexual disorder.” Affect regulation could be failing at a different stage of sexual stimulus processing not studied.

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

Data from two frequently used measures (Body Image Scale, Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1979; Body Satisfaction Scale, Berscheid, Walster & Bohrnstedt, 1973) provided an evaluation of the construct and the assessment of body image. Two studies are provided. The construct analyses suggest two contents for body attitude measures: a general factor of body, facial, and sexual (genital and breast) items, and a second factor assessing weight and/or its body correlates—the hips, thighs, and buttocks. Also, a method factor, a response style of negativity, may be important. Body image attitudes are correlated with some conceptually relevant criteria, such as interest in engaging in sexual activity; however, these relationships do not appear sufficiently strong to predict behavior, such as the occurrence or resolution of sexual dysfunction. Generalized body image disturbance as currently conceptualized and assessed may be difficult to document, particularly when item content and response styles are considered.",

Until recently, it has been considered that sexual activity in women is initiated by desire, which produces arousal. This leads to orgasm and resolution.1, 2 In practice, sexual desire and arousal are not isolated psychological and physiological states but interdigitate and feed back on each other. In a new relationship a woman's sexual desire is often spontaneous.3 In effect this means that thoughts of her partner or seeing him are sufficient to produce an urge to want sexual relations to take place. This produces both mental excitement and bodily arousal (for example, vaginal lubrication, uterine “tenting,” breast enlargement). These sensations (arousal) feed back to produce a greater desire for intercourse. However, it is also well recognised that women are less attentive to genital sensations than men, and indeed may lubricate and vasocongest in the vulva and vagina in the absence of mental sexual excitement.\n\nThe DSM IV definition of low sexual desire, or to be more precise, hypoactive sexual desire disorder is “persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. …",

The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

      "abstract": "Introduction.So far we have spoken about social norms and standards of sexual behaviour.However, how these standards are reflected in our minds, and what lies in the basis of the sexual motivation of the individual remain open questions.Criticism of the instinctivist model of libido does not mean denying the biological determinants of sexuality.In the mid-1960s, R. Whalen proposed to replace the abstract concept of \"power of desire\" with a more specific concept of sexual excitability, i.e., readiness to respond to a sexual situation sexually and erotically.Sexual excitability has great individual variations determined by the physiological state of the body (hormonal balance and such) as well as the life (sexual, emotional, and communicative) experience of the subject and their non-sexual motives.According to R. Whalen, sexual arousal, i.e., current, temporary psychophysiological state, is a function of stable excitability of the subject, and particular given external and internal situation.Modern psychological literature describes sexual motivation in terms of the theory of needs, the theory of emotion, and cognitive psychology alike.However, the most productive theory in terms of opportunities for integrating psychological and sociological data is the theory of \"sexual script\" suggested by William E. Simon and John Gagnon.Presenting main material.As the special studies show, erotic dreams, night dreams, and fantasies are an essential aspect of our sexuality.They do not only substitute actual sex life or fill in its deficit, as S. Freud believed, but also constantly accompany it.More sexually active people also have more intense erotic imagination that supports, encourages and diversifies their real experience.For those brought up in Victorian spirit, the words \"erotic\" and \"eroticism\" sound as offensive phrases denoting something \"animal\" and low.In fact, animals do not know what eroticism is.The ability to not only respond to erotic signs and images, but also create them implementing your imagination is an exclusively human property, inherent to us, as the history of art says, from ancient times.Erotic images perform four main functions.First, they are all tools of cognition, displaying and capturing sexually significant properties and experiences.Second, they serve as a kind of psychological stimulants of sexual arousal.Third, they expand the",

Mas que la diferencia de edad -factor, sin duda, fundamental que distorsiona toda posibilidad de relacion libremente consentida-, lo que define el abuso es la asimetria entre los implicados en la relacion y la presencia de coaccion -explicita o implicita(Lopez, 1997; Sosa y Capafons, 1996). No deja por ello de ser significativo que el 20 por ciento del abuso sexual infantil este provocado por otros menores. Las conductas abusivas incluyen un contacto fisico (genital, anal o bucal), o suponen una utilizacion del menor como objeto de estimulacion sexual del agresor (exhibicionismo o voyeurismo), o incluso de terceras personas, como cuando se utiliza a un nino para la produccion de pornografia (Madansky, 1996). . No es facil determinar la incidencia real de este problema en la poblacion porque ocurre habitualmente en un entorno privado -la familiay los menores pueden sentirse impotentes para revelar el abuso (Nogueral, 1997). Segun el informe de Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis y Smith (1990) -primera encuesta nacional de Estados Unidos, llevada a cabo en adultos, sobre la historia de abuso sexual-, un 27 por ciento de las mujeres y un 16 por ciento de los hombres reconocian, retrospectivamente, haber sido victimas de abusos sexuales en la infancia. En Espana, la frecuencia de los abusos, al menos en un sentido muy amplio del termino, puede afectar al 20 por ciento de la poblacion (23 por ciento de chicas y 15 por ciento de chicos). Al margen de esta tasa de prevalencia-ya de por si muy alta-, en el 44 por ciento de los casos el abuso no se ha limitado a un acto aislado (Lopez, 1995, 1997).",

In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

      "abstract": "1. This paper has dealt with the definition of the term sexual psychopath (and suggested alternatives), with special reference to the difficulties that have been encountered in applying it for legal purposes. 2. The range of psychiatric opinion as to the definition and possible applications of the term is so broad and the relevant scientific data and formulations so tentative, that the term is nearly meaningless for diagnostic purposes. 3. The term sexual psychopath is used by psychiatrists not as a specific diagnostic label, but as a descriptive term necessary for administrative purposes. Social maladjustment in the sexual sphere is the main criterion for application of the term. 4. Therefore, until psychiatric nomenclature is further refined, it is important that tentative, clinically useful terminology relating to sexual personality pattern disorders not be forced into legal statutes as final and definitive. 5. There is a distinction between psychiatric and legal concepts and definitions f sexual abnormality. While psychiatry is concerned with the entire range of sexual behavior as clinical phenomena, either overt behavior or latent or repressed tendencies, the law is concerned only with sexual behavior that is dangerous or morally offensive. 6. Legal definitions of sexual psychopath make use of both psychiatric and legal terms but these terms are not themselves specific enough to justify their use in legal finding. 7. The sexual psychopath laws, based on inexact psychiatric terminology, have proved to be as ineffective administratively as the criminal sex laws. 8. Efforts to correct current unsatisfactory sex legislation take 2 main forms: (a) clarification of definitions in present laws, and (b) formulation of new legislation that will provide psychiatric consultation but will not depend for its application upon precise diagnosis. 9. Even though psychiatric concepts and definitions in the area of antisocial sexual behavior are still in the formative stage, psychiatric consultative services appear to offer the most fruitful approach to the problem of the sex offender.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating sexual disorders in general and erectile dysfunction in particular tend to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life of all individuals and couples affected. The objective of this study was to identify the main characteristics and correlates of erectile dysfunction which are key elements in improving the diagnosis procedure, comorbidities prevention and the implementation of efficient treatment protocols, the aims of our main research project. Preliminary data of an erectile dysfunction screening in a Romanian population are discussed. Keywords: sexual disorders, erectile dysfunction, screening INTRODUCTION Sexual activity is very important for most individuals, regardless of age, sex or sexual orientation. However, throughout our lifespan, different changes at the physical or psychological level may influence, among others, our sex life. Moreover, most women and men occasionally experience sexual difficulties. If these sexual difficulties prevent the individual or couple from enjoying sexual activity during any phase of the sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and if they cause distress and interpersonal problems, sexual disorders are very likely to be present. Since people tend to avoid talking about their sexual problems, many people develop various myths about what is and what is not normal when it comes to sex life. Society, media or religion tend to shape unrealistic or dysfunctional images of sexual behavior. The lack of acknowledgement of certain disorders and over diagnosing others are, to a certain extent, common phenomena. Sexual disorders can also be often mistaken for various symptoms of several other mental disorders (such as affective and anxiety disorders) as they appear together quite frequently. The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating these disorders tends to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life. Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as (male) impotence, is one of the most frequent sexual disorders; ED is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient to permit a satisfactory sexual intercourse (Coman, 2004). Although ED is referred to as a benign pathology, it has a significant negative effect on the patients, their couple lives and their socioprofessional performances. The incidence and prevalence of ED have grown remarkably lately, not only because of the population aging effect and of the increasingly higher action of risk factors on the general population, but also because of the beginning of use, at the end of the last millennium, of oral medication against this pathology, medication that had the role to raise awareness of the masculine population regarding this pathology. The socio-cultural prejudice and the perception that ED is part of the aging process have led to a poor addressing of elderly men to doctors [contrary to the general perception, Helgason (1996) indicates that 13% of the patients aged 50 to 80 consider sexual activity to be very important, 29% see it as important, 41% consider occasional sexual acts to be pleasant and only 17% consider sex not to be important]. Most patients turn to medical assistance only in severe cases of the pathology, when the diagnosis and the treatment are more complex and costly. On a global level, the prevalence of ED is over 500 million men; estimative data (Ayac et al., 1999) predict a doubling of the prevalence of ED in 2025, this problem becoming thereby a serious public health issue. Among the Eastern European countries, Romania has the highest prevalence of ED, 25% in the general population, which means that one out of four men experience such difficulties. According to the CLOSER study (Porav-Hodade, et al., 2007) ED is even more frequent in older men; more than half of men over 50 years of age have different levels of ED. …",

Sexual functioning requires an integration of neurological, vascular and endocrine systems and interpretation in the brain. As a complex biopsychosocial process, in addition to the biological factors, including health and psychological status of the person/couple (mood, personality traits), and psychosocial factors like religious beliefs, personal experience, ethnicity and socio-demographic conditions play an important role in sexual functioning and satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that sexual satisfaction does not always correlate with sexual function. Furthermore, partnered sexual activity involves interpersonal relationships and the unique attitudes, needs and responses of each of the partners. A problem in any of these areas may lead to sexual complaints or dysfunctions [1].",

It drives our sexual fantasies, compels us to seek out and evaluate sexual incentives, regulates our levels of sexual arousal and desire, and enables us to masturbate, copulate, or engage in other forms of sex play. Although sexual motivation is often viewed as an internal process built upon neuroendocrine mechanisms, such as alterations in brain neurochemical function set forth by steroid hormone actions, it is also modulated by experiences and expectations, learned patterns of behavior and underlying neural activity related to sexual arousal, desire, reward, and inhibition. In turn, these aspects of sexual function feed back on mechanisms of motivation, either to increase (as in the case of arousal, desire, or reward, Fig. 3.1a) or decrease (as in the case of reward or inhibition, Fig. 3.1b) the expression of sexual interest or libido. Delineating the neural mechanisms that underlie these aspects of sexual function has been the focus of recent research in animals and humans.",

      "title": "Health-related behaviours in context",
      "abstract": "Health behaviours, sometimes referred to as (health) risk behaviours, theoretically refer to any practices, habits or actions which, either in the short or long term, have an effect on health, either positively or negatively. In medicine generally, and life-course epidemiology specifically, they are often conceptualized as components of an individual's lifestyle, or even as lifestyles themselves. By virtue of human agency, or at least the potential for agency, they are distinguished from social structure (e.g. social class) which is typically understood as an external (material and/or cultural) constraint. In most studies, they are usually represented by four behaviours; diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, and (increasingly) in the case of young people illicit drug use. Sexual behaviour is also referred to, but as the subject of another chapter, is not included here. From a sociological perspective, these behaviours are not so easily reducible to lifestylevariables, nor are they necessarily dis-embedded from social structure. Each is imbued with social meaning, both in the way they are socially constructed through, for example, advertising and the media and in the way they are consumed, and displayed by individuals. For young people, they are especially strong signifiers of identity since they are so closely connected with the youth-adult transition, minimum ages for the legal purchase of tobacco and alcohol marking stages in the achievement of adult status in most developed countries. They are also remarkably precise signifiers of youth identities, group membership and subcultures, as indicated by the way particular young people engage in physical activity (and which activities), whether they smoke or drink (and which brands they consume) or use illicit drugs (and which drugs). The extent to which such health behaviours continue to be shaped by social structures such as social class, and the extent to which they are lifestyle choices, is an important indicator of where any society is positioned in late modernity. This chapter begins with a brief overview of the social epidemiology of diet, physicalactivity, smoking, drinking and drug use among youth in developed societies, focusing on health consequences, prevalence issues, and age, gender and cross-national variations. A review of ethnic group and religious differences is beyond the scope of the chapterthough they are clearly important (e.g. for diet and alcohol). Developing from this, against the background of the structure/agency debate (Furlong and Cartmel 2007), and representing the former by young people's social class of origin, the latter by various lifestyles, an assessment is made of the relative importance of each for health behaviours in contemporary society. The chapter concludes with a closer look at the social contexts within which young people's health behaviours are developed, and the social processes involved. It is within these particular contexts, notably the school and the peer group, that the meaning of health behaviours for identity, group membership and lifestyles can best be understood. Because most research has been undertaken on young people of school-age, the focus is primarily on 'early youth' though the implications extend beyond school.",

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfillment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfillment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific element, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

Many individual or personal factors are associated with desire, including demographic attributes (e.g., chronological age, gender), mental and physical health variables (e.g., chronic illness, mood disorders), and hormonal processes (e.g., testosterone levels). Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

      "title": "Bye-bye, sexuality",
      "abstract": "The psychoanalytic concept of sexuality continues to be misunderstood and confused as something else. For Freud, sexuality does not offer any firm ground where the subject can stand up, walk steadily, move forward easily and travel comfortably to a given destination. It does not ever represent some \"thing\" that men and women can conquer and/or possess. As a concept, it cannot be compared to gender, which offers culturally and socially reassuring explanations. In contrast, Freudian sexuality, bisexuality and sexual difference cannot be fitted into any model; they do not constitute a guide or a map full of recognizable signs to follow, like heavenly bodies in the firmament. Just the opposite: they produce confusion, anxieties, uncertainty. Sexuality is problematic and conflicting; unconscious desires will never be fully realized. If anything could be said about sexuality, it would be to characterize it as infantile and polymorphous; perverse and not gender-specific. It is also, in part, an unconsciously remembered event: it belongs to a previous moment in the subject's infantile life, now repeated, never forgotten: … once upon a time. … Suckling at the breast or playing and experimenting with different orifices of the body, for example, reappear in the foreplay of adult sexuality. This link is necessarily unconscious; paradoxically, the knowledge of this connection is not accepted by our consciousness, because it never existed in the first place – except, rather ironically, nachträglich. This irony can also be understood as a tragic joke: sexual pleasure is possible because the connection was, from the beginning, only there in the negative – completely unknown to the subject. 1",

So much so that you can be exposed to stress anytime, from home, business life, to the street, in traffic. This situation has made stress a part of modern life. Any situation or event, such as losing a close person, workplace stress, or even living in isolation at home during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, can also be a source of stress. Responses that occur in the organism to the stress stimulus are for the benefit of the organism up to a certain level. However, when the duration and intensity of the stress stimulus increase, pathological conditions occur in all physiological systems. Long-term exposure to stress may cause infertility in men by causing decreases in sperm parameters such as sperm quality, sperm concentration, spermatozoid count, and sperm percentage. Various substances are being researched to reduce these adverse effects of stress on the reproductive system. Studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and so on. It shows positive efficacy in male infertility with various mechanisms. This review it is aimed to give information on the effect of stress on the male reproductive system and the relationship between melatonin.",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

Mature genital organisation—that is, full recognition of oneself and of the other in his or her entirety—is an ideal for men as it is for women. Perhaps for a woman the problem, although equally as crucial, can be less obvious since she can easily dissimulate to herself and to her partner because she does not have to \"show\" or \"demonstrate\" anything at the concrete level about her ability to enjoy or give pleasure.",

Since sexual attraction to both genders was considered normal, the main divisions concerned age, social status, and role: females and smooth males (boys 12–18) were desirable objects, hairy males (men) undesirable; the active partner was penetrative and thus masculine, the passive partner penetrated and thus female or effeminate, so that it was shameful and improper, slavish, and arguably unnatural for free males of any age to play the passive role whether for a price or voluntarily except in certain initiatory or military contexts institutionalized in some communities. No comparable sanctions applied to the active partner.",

In a number of instances, perhaps not quite so infrequently as is generally believed, it may persist longer. During childhood, the position of the bladder changes. The vascular and nervous supply of the urinary and genital system make their relationship one of more than mere position, and so it would not be strange if the development and function of one exercised some influence on the other. Guyon,<sup>1</sup>at any rate, emphasized the venous engorgement of the sexual organs on distention of the bladder.

      "abstract": "Pornography is verbal or pictorial material which represents or describes sexual behavior that is degrading or abusive to one or more of the participants in such a way as to endorse the degradation. To the extent that women's sexual pleasure is represented at all, it is subordinated to that of men and is never an end in itself as is the sexual pleasure of men. What pleases women is the use of their bodies to satisfy male desires. The participants so treated in virtually all heterosexual pornography are women or children, so heterosexual pornography is, as a matter of fact, material which endorses sexual behavior that is degrading and/or abusive to women and children. Control of pornography diminishes freedom—directly the freedom of pornographers, indirectly that of all of us. The entrenchment of pornography in our culture gives it significance quite beyond its explicit sexual messages.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Despite the growing scientific interest in sexuality, the influence of pregnancy on this variable aspect of human behavior is not well understood. An intensive and detailed personal interview was conducted with 260 women in the immediate post-partum period concerning their sexual behavior during pregnancy. It was found that for most women coital activity declines in a linear fashion once pregnancy is discovered. Orgasmic activity, sexual interest and noncoital behavior are similarly affected. The decrease in noncoital behavior, such as mutual oral-genital stimulation suggests that more than attitudes and comfort with sexuality are involved. Despite the significant and steady reduction in sexual behavior for most women, some increased their activity, reflecting the highly individualistic nature of human sexuality and response to pregnancy. The decrease or increase in sexual activity is not predictable by socioeconomic or other demographic factors. There was no relation between sexual activity and prematurity.

      "abstract": "The article describes causes of hypoactive sexual desire, which is associated with: tiredness and emotional overstrain; multiple abortions; rave for a person who is not a member of this couple of spouses/partners; criticism of physical qualities of one’s male/female partner; disturbance of interpersonal relations in the couple of spouses/partners; loss of sensuous charm caused by habituation; preference of masturbation over sexual intercourses; disregard for sexual needs of a woman; reproaches of sexual nature; conflicts of one spouse with parents of another one; age factor; sexual problems of one’s partner and his/her health condition; negative body image; presence of sexual or emotional abuse in the anamnesis; loss of job; severe loss. It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one’s male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

The older males, although sexually less vigorous than the younger males when copulating under non-handling conditions, when handled became quite as active as the younger males. It was concluded that the mating activity is determined not only by sexual stimuli but by non-sexual stimuli as well, and that the decrease in sexual activity characteristic to the old rat can be compensated for by an increase in the non-sexual sensory stimulation of the animal.",

Dressing was and is part of the performance of sexuality, gender, class, and piety, and medieval artists developed a highly sophisticated iconography of dress. The female body in the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim visual arts was most often demurely covered, which left clothing as the main signifier for sex/gender identity, whether suggesting or concealing the body underneath. Unlike the frontal nude male body, the female nude never signified the microcosm, the zodiac, the body politic, or even all humankind. The naked female body demonstrated gynaecological traits or invoked forbidden pagan goddess cults; it also narrated the torture of saints. Birthing and pregnancy were seldom fully revealed, but gynaecological power was inherent in visual displays of the vulva. Cross-dressed females and the feminine component of hybrids were discoverable through long hair or breasts. Souls (feminine Latin noun animae) were usually rendered as naked females, recognisable by their long hair though without other sexual markers.",

More freedom, and decrease of sexual inhibition, has implications both in the cases of men who tend to make split object choices and in those who fear intimacy and merging experiences with the object. Feminine sexuality has been considered the obscure area of psychoanalytic theorisations, as though everything regarding masculine sexuality had, instead, been totally clarified. During the years in which transformations in sexual habits were developing, \"unisex\"—if the author uses a more or less wild analogy—seemed to have become equivalent to \"egalite, liberte, fraternite\". She returns to the point from which her reflections started, namely to the attempt to understand the underlying vicissitudes of male sexuality. Sexuality in its more mature, genital expressions includes sensuality as the earliest phases of \"affection\", but entails the emergence of object-directed libidinal and aggressive drives.",

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one’s daughter’s sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents’ reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

Illegal is punishable by deprivation of liberty to the person who commits them according to the norms indicated in the Integrated Code of Criminal Integral.\r\nArticle 171 of the Integral Criminal Code punishes the crime of rape, indicating that it is the carnal access, with total or partial introduction of the virile member, orally, anal or vaginal; Or the introduction, by vaginal or anal, of objects, fingers or organs other than the virile member, to a person of either sex. Whoever commits it shall be punished with imprisonment from nineteen to twenty-two years in any of the following cases: 1. When the victim is deprived of reason or sense or when due to illness or disability he can not resist; 2. When violence, threats or intimidation are used; 3. When the victim is under the age of fourteen.- The maximum penalty provided for in the first subparagraph shall be sanctioned when: 1. The victim, as a result of the infraction, suffers a physical injury or permanent psychological damage. 2. The victim, as a consequence of the infraction, contracts a serious or mortal illness. 3. The victim is under the age of ten.\r\nIn the event that the victim is a minor of ten years, the maximum penalty that the offender can receive is twenty-two years, insufficient penalty, because the child is more than a person subject to rights, is protected by those of attention As stated in Article 46, numeral 4, of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador, which states: Protection and care against all forms of violence, mistreatment, sexual exploitation or any other type of exploitation.

      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is unwanted and unwanted behavior or attention of a sexual nature and results in disturbing the harasser. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to: sexual payments for wanting something, coercion of sexual activity, derogatory statements about sexual orientation or sexuality, requests for sexual favors by the perpetrator, speech or behavior that has a sexual connotation; all can be classified as sexual harassment. This action can be conveyed directly or implicitly. The effect is on the victim, who is considered to be causing problems and not the perpetrator. In general, victims will keep their mouths shut, sometimes for a very long time, for these reasons, and there is a fear that they will become targets of abuse. They don't talk about it with friends or family. The healing process will be more difficult when there is denial from the institution, distrust, or blaming the victim. The rampant sexual harassment that is happening in Indonesia is troubling most people. Even during the current covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in sexual harassment that occurs against women, even worse, it also happens to children who are still underage. Komnas Perempuan identified that during 2001 to 2012, there were at least 35 women who were victims of sexual violence every day. Meanwhile, the data released by Komnas Perempuan during the current covid-19 pandemic is 1,902 cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in Indonesia, as of Saturday, July 3, 2021. In this case, it is clear that there is still a lack of legal protection for cases involving threaten a person's personal personality, especially in cases of sexual harassment to sexual violence.",

      "abstract": "At around their third birthday, children begin to enforce social norms on others impersonally, often using generic normative language, but little is known about the developmental building blocks of this abstract norm understanding. Here, we investigate whether even toddlers show signs of enforcing on others interpersonally how “we” do things. In an initial dyad, 18‐month‐old infants learnt a simple game‐like action from an adult. In two experiments, the adult either engaged infants in a normative interactive activity (stressing that this is the way “we” do it) or, as a non‐normative control, marked the same action as idiosyncratic, based on individual preference. In a test dyad, infants had the opportunity to spontaneously intervene when a puppet partner performed an alternative action. Infants intervened, corrected, and directed the puppet more in the normative than in the non‐normative conditions. These findings suggest that, during the second year of life, infants develop second‐personal normative expectations about their partner's behavior (“You should do X!”) in social interactions, thus making an important step toward understanding the normative structure of human cultural activities. These simple normative expectations will later be scaled up to group‐minded and abstract social norms.",

      "abstract": "Abstrak Pelecehan seksual atau pun pencabulan pada dasarnya adalah merupakan bagian dari kekerasan gender, artinya kedua bentuk tindak pelanggaran terhadap hak perempuan ini dilakukan bukan semata-mata karena faktor spontanitas atau sekedar penyaluran libido para lelaki yang sudah tak bisa lagi di tunda melainkan peristiwa ini terjadi karena di belakang benak pelaku maupun korban. Dalam berbagai kasus pencabulan atau kekerasan seksual lainya, sering kali yang dipersalahkan adalah pihak korban. Pengertian cabul adalah sesutau yang melanggar kesusilaan yang dilakukan dengan perbuatan-perbuatan. Bagi pelaku pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur ini sering disebut dengan istilah phedofilia yaitu suatu suatu istilah dari ilmu kejiwaan yaitu phedofil yang artinya dapat disimpulkan ialah melampiaskan hasrat seksual kepada anak-anak. Pada faktor kejiwaan yang menyimpang inilah yang merupakan salah satu faktor yang mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana perkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur. Penyebab penyakit Phedofilia ini sangat bervariasi ada yang berupa trauma sewaktu kecil akibat pernah disodomi ataupun ketidaksukaan terhadap orang dewasa akan tetapi lebih menyukai anak-anak di bawah umur dalam hal hubungan seksualnya. Bahwa mengenai pertimbangan hakim dalam memutus tindak pidana pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak dibawah umur dalam putusan Pengadilan Negeri Tangerang No. perkara 1616/PID.SUS/2014/PN.TNG dengan terdakwa Adang Supena bin (alm) Djaidi, hakim telah mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor yang meringankan maupun yang memberatkan yang ada pada diri terdakwa, seperti sifat baik dan jahat dari pelaku, motif dan tujuan dilakukannya tindak pidana, cara melakukan, keadaan sosial ekonomi, dan pengaruh pidana terhadap masa depan pelaku, korban maupun keluarga korban. Faktor-faktor yang dapat meningkatkan dan mempengaruhi terjadinya tindak pidana pencabulan dan pemerkosaan terhadap anak di bawah umur yaitu factor lingkungan, faktor kebudayaan, faktor ekonomi, faktor media, dan factor psikologi atau kejiwaan pelaku. Dalam kasus ini pertimbangan hakim dalam menjatuhkan pidana adalah pertimbangan dari segi pembuktian perbuatan pidana dan berdasarkan pertimbangan sisi kebenaran formal (kenbenaran menurut hukum) di mana semua unsur dalam dakwaan telah dapat dibuktikan dan pertimbangan dari sisi kebenaran mutlak (kebenaran materil) seperti pengakuan terdakwa, alat bukti, keyakinan dalam diri hakim dan lain-lainnya.

However, the man whose nights of sleep get frequently disrupted due to painful nocturnal erections, the so called “sleep-related painful erections”, might prefer never to have an erection again.

Nevertheless, a (sexual) realtionship can be seriously disturbed by the consequences of the sleep deprivation: stress, anxiety, absenteeism and feelings of despair. Only a single prolonged erection, that lasts beyond 4 hours and is called “priapism”, can even cause the penile corporal tissue to become completely necrotic and irreversibly devastated.This thesis describes the historical aspects, symptomatology, pathophysiology and an analysis of different forms of treatment. The aim was to gain attention for these poorly recognized pathologic forms of erection and get one step closer to an evidence-based treatment advise.",

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfilment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfilment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific elements, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

      "abstract": "In the forthcoming 5 th Edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), as in previous editions, there are two overarching types of sexual problems. The first type is the ‘sexual dysfunctions’. Animating this category, we would argue, is a concern to address sexual experiences and behaviours understood as insufficiently intense in duration, magnitude or frequency. The disorders included in the category are thus predominantly those associated with a lack of arousal or pleasure, or which are physically inimical to penetration. The second type of sexual problem is labelled ‘the paraphilias’. DSM-5 distinguishes within the paraphilias as a diagnostic category between ‘paraphilias’ and ‘paraphilic disorders’: the former are understood as merely abnormal whereas the latter are pathological and require correction. Organising the category of the paraphilias, we would suggest, is a concern with forms of subjectivity with illegitimate objects of sexual attraction or pleasure. This ‘point of view’ article sets out to explore and explain, with swift brushstrokes, the gendered logic underlying the delineation of pathological desires, pleasures and acts in the proposed sexual dysfunctions and paraphilias. Our focus is on changes from previous editions of the DSM. We shall contend that the proposed sexual dysfunctions and paraphilias utilise, refract and ultimately naturalise troubling societal assumptions about gender. Kristeva (1980 [1975]: 133) has argued that ‘the notion of heterogeneity is indispensable’ as a starting point for investigations of the logic of classificatory structures, and their role in organising and occluding relations of gender power. That is to say, confronted with a taxonomic system of forms of human life, Kristeva suggests that",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. …",

In most animal species, this process is dangerous; vigilance is reduced and vulnerability to predators increased. In mammals, the pattern of hormonal control of the female's sexual behaviour varies across species. Males are more consistent, with testosterone being necessary for both adequate sexual behaviour and male fertility in virtually all species. The variety of socio-sexual structure is also reflected in the level of sexual activity of the male and/or female that characterizes a species. The \"power\" of sexuality tends to be regarded as an aspect of masculinity, with the male, for both social and physical reasons, typically being in a position of dominance. Offering oneself as a sexual partner for payment or other material benefits is a well-established aspect of human sexuality, as well as being evident among primates.",

      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome.

      "abstract": "Some of us will have a fetish of one kind or another, many of which are socially acceptable, such as enjoying perfume or seductive clothing. It has been suggested that most fetishists are men, who gain sexual excitement by tasting, touching or smelling an object while masturbating.1\n\nFor someone with a condom fetish, this might mean gaining pleasure from looking at pictures or videos portraying people ingesting or masturbating with used condoms. Others might search for discarded condoms to masturbate in to or ingest the contents. Some men “condom hunt” in areas where people have public sex, such as car parks or wooded areas. Used condoms are also purchased online.\n\nA few years ago, a fetish website at http://www.condomswappers.com was …",

      "abstract": "Like many aspects of self, my sexuality remained under wraps for the first three decades of my life. I felt desexualised in my body, unaware of my autism but deeply aware of my alienation and social position. Unable to find a sexual reflection in popular culture and bombarded with tropes of toxic masculinity I turned my sexual desires inwards. Only with my closest confidant, my partner, did any semblance of sexuality emerge, mediated by images and symbols imbibed as a teenager. My deep desire for connection that extended into sexuality felt ossified and unaired—kept in an air-sealed wrapper, like a vintage toy to be sold in the future or admired on a shelf. The sexuality that emerges from within me doesn't feel constrained and defined by borders or the models used by the dominant culture. It is lush, verdant, warm, damp. It is not a shape defined by others. It is not attached to gender. It is not a taxonomical category to which I ascribe. My sexuality extends from the love that I easily feel towards other bodyminds like mine and the intimacy with which I seek to imbue relations. It need not be segregated and distinct.",

      "abstract": "Impotency means a man who is unable to perform sexual intercourse, being powerless and unable to carry out sexual activities. Nowadays Klaibya is considered as one of the most common problems affecting the males having variable severity. Change in lifestyle, food habits, sedentary lifestyle and some psychological causes like Chinta, Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha etc. causes Klaibya. The male sexual dysfunctions have been elaborately described as Klaibya (Impotency) in Ayurvedic classics. In clinical practices Klaibya (Impotency) is the most common psychosexual disorders. It has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patients along with their partners. It is projected as a medico-social problem. Vajikarana, a specialized branch of Ayurveda deals in treating these problems. It refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual cycle that restricts the man from experiencing satisfaction from the activity. Nowadays the incidence of sexual dysfunction is increasing due to age, sedentary life style, unhealthy foods etc. About 5% of 35 years old men and between 15% and 25% of 50 years old men experience sexual dysfunctions. Vajikarana (Medicine which improves sexual capability) branch of Ashtanga Ayurveda (one of the subjects of Ayurved study) deals with fertility, potency and healthy progeny. In this branch diagnosis and management of infertility and Sexual dysfunction are dealt in detail.",

      "abstract": "38 schizoid and 70 hysterical patients with neurotic disturbances are compared with regard to social data, intelligence and triggering situation. Schizoids are more frequently single, childless and live alone, while hysterics are married, remarried or divorced, have one child and live with their partner and the child. With nearly the same education and intelligence, schizoid patients are more often workers/skilled workers, pupils/apprentices/students or have no profession; hysterically structured individuals, being predominantly women, are more frequently housewives. Nearly half of the most frequent triggering events are equally distributed in both structure groups; these are particularly events signalling a change during development, which, in degree of severity, can just as well be minor threshold situations as serious reverses. With an earlier age of onset, schizoids decompensate significantly more often in \"developmental stages\", whereas hysterical patients are more likely to do so in connection with events of \"love-sexuality\" and those which provoke hysterical anxieties. Of the 15 most frequent events, only 6 each occur in either the schizoids (starting school, puberty, moving away from home, entering into a heterosexual relationship in terms of a casual encounter, beginning an apprenticeship or studies, failure in a test) or the hysterically structured individuals (vacation, marriage, pregnancy/delivery, marital disharmony, extra-marital relationship and severe illness of the patient).",

The feminine connotation also pertains to most definitions of nursing. Thus, among the 10 definitions of the word nursing in the unabridged edition of the Random House Dictionary of the English Language that pertain to the provision of personal assistance, nurturing, or care to others, six refer specifically to the feminine role of the nurse or allude to a process, suckling, that can only be performed by the female. No wonder men hesitate to enter a profession that is almost universally perceived as being related to the feminine role and feminine activities.",

Actually, S/M is a catchall term for a wide range of individual passions and practices, with an endless spectrum of possibilities for expression. Among homosexuals, S/M is institutionalized to the extent that particular symbolic acts of dominance and submission are more common than others, most of which involve no pain whatsoever. Also, an elaborate scheme of norms control certain aspects of the scene, especially the action itself. Finally, a common path of entry can be traced. The action of gay S/M is termed leathersex, and its members are leathermen. This study may serve to construct an enlightened view of gay S/M.1",

      "title": "Biological sex differences relevant to mental health",
      "abstract": "Scientific interest in the effects of the female sex steroids on modulating mood and behaviour stems largely in the modern era from the well-recognized sex differences found in certain psychiatric disorders.The finding across many cultures and ethnic backgrounds from large epidemiological studies that women have twice the prevalence rate for depression as men, that this only becomes apparent after the onset of puberty, and that after the menopause rates return to near parity between the sexes, is a strong finding implicating a role for female gonadal hormones in playing an active part in such discrepancy. Further epidemiological evidence for sex steroids' capability to impact on mood and behaviour comes from the high rate of mood disturbance and psychosis seen in the postpartum period, a time of dramatic and rapid change in gonadal steroid secretion, in addition to the occurrence of a discrete menstrual cycle-related mood disorder (the premenstrual or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder), for which removal of the ovaries has been noted to be curative. Some conditions which may not be associated with a sex difference in lifetime prevalence rates are nevertheless associated with marked differences in course or outcome between the sexes, such as the later age of onset of schizophrenia in females, who generally manifest a less severe disorder which is more responsive to treatment, and who display a second peak onset around the time of the menopause, all suggestive of a somewhat protective role for gonadal steroids in this disorder.How do gonadal steroids have such widespread effects on the brain so as to explain these sex differences? While current knowledge is far from complete on this issue, this chapter will outline some key structural and functional differences between a female and male brain which arise due to the differential actions of the gonadal steroids. In particular, those central structures and systems which are believed to play an integral role in the psychiatric disorders for which a marked sex difference exists will be focused upon, including the limbic system, the various neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, and finally the neuroendocrine system involved in the stress response, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.",

      "title": "The Spiel of Male Victims Later Being the Abusers",
      "abstract": "Children who are subjected to sexual abuse often endure deep, long-term psychological trauma. Many of them struggle with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sexual dysfunction, and self-harming tendencies. Research shows that children who experience such abuse are significantly more vulnerable to being revictimized sometimes not just once, but repeatedly throughout adolescence and even adulthood. Alarmingly, studies indicate they are up to 35 times more likely to be abused again than those who have not faced childhood sexual trauma. This increased susceptibility is often rooted in feelings of self-blame, worthlessness, and shame.This issue becomes even more disturbing when we look at children who live on the margins of society those without shelter, family care, or institutional protection. Children on the streets, in slums, or those forced into child labor such as rag-picking or begging are especially exposed. With no stable home, adult supervision, or legal protection, these children are not only easier targets for sexual predators, but they also lack the means to report abuse or even understand what is happening to them. For many of them, trauma becomes a silent companion unspoken, untreated, and slowly destructive.",

Interference behavior can take several forms, including highly aggressive acts (sexual interruption) as well as milder forms of interference (sexual harassment) that result in a reduced likelihood of mating to ejaculation. Most reported cases of mating interference behavior in primates occur in species where males actively mate guard, or attempt to ensure female fidelity through direct forms of sexual coercion. However, sexual harassment has also been found in female and immature primates for different behavior strategies.",

In Bachmann and coll. study, sexually active women ranging from 60 to 70, without HRT had higher mean levels of E2 and T than sexually inactive women. Of course the numerous complaints of that period (hot flushes, asthenia, tachycardia...) are creating physical and psychological conditions rather damaging for sexuality. They may also induce a state of true suffering with a loss of self esteem resulting in a more introverted way of life. In other cases, it is the psychological context in it self (depression, anxiety, relational difficulty with the partner or even male sexual problems) which is interfering. An actual amelioration of sexual life can be obtained with HRT plus or a minima percutaneous androgenotherapy in some cases. The treatment is indeed an asset for the therapeutic support, even from the psychotherapeutic point of view.",

Due to different research the very serious problem is a phenomena of mobbing. Psychological terror or mobbing in working life involves hostile and unethical communication which is directed in a systematic manner by one or more individuals, mainly toward one individual, who, due to mobbing, is pushed into a helpless and defenseless position and held there by means of continuing mobbing activities. These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months´ duration). Because of the high frequency and long duration of hostile behavior, this maltreatment results in considerable mental, psychosomatic and social misery.",

Freud then observes the experience of “pleasure” (Lust) in the child as an experience that is associated at first with the “gender drive” (Geschlechtstrieb), an impulse anterior to the sexual drive (Sexualtrieb). The gender drive has long been ignored by translators, who have unduly assimilated the sexual drive, whereas the gender drive precedes the latter in the construction of the body of the child and in his/her quest for identity. The power drive that the child then engages in can lead him/her to seek out jouissance—albeit in the form of assuming power over the other—before being able to define and accept him/herself as a being separated from the mother, an autonomous being in the elaboration of his/her own body.",

Genital surgery performed on unconsenting minors (including both circumcision and sex-reassignment surgery) has been claimed by its adherents to cause few adverse psychological effects. However, mounting evidence now reveals that such genital cutting causes harm physically, sexually, and often psychologically. For example, among 313 men circumcised as infants, 75% reported psychological harm, 60% reported resentment, 54% reported anger, 50% felt violated, 47% felt inferior to intact males, and 43% believed that circumcision impeded sexual relations. Individuals circumcised as children or subjected to sex-change operations have often described their experiences in the language of violation, torture, mutilation, and sexual assault. In view of the possible long-term adverse effects on mental health caused by unnecessary genital surgery on infants and children, it is time to cease all forms of such non-therapeutic genital cutting.",

      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

      "title": "“What a Girl Wants”: What Can We Learn From Animal Models of Female Sexual Motivation?",
      "abstract": "Sexual motivation is notably different than other motivations such as hunger and thirst, because it lacks homeostatic drive. Sexual motivation poses no threat to physical well-being; individual survival is not at stake. Nevertheless, sexual motivation is a powerful drive and is critical for species survival. Understanding the complexity of sexual motivation has the potential to advance our understanding of other motivations, even pathological motivations, such as those associated with substance abuse. The study of motivation that is unique to females has often been neglected. A number of paradigms have been developed to investigate female sexual motivation beyond measuring only the lordosis reflex. Lordosis is a reflexive posture displayed by female mammals in response to male sexual stimulation to facilitate intromission. The lordosis reflex is essential, but studying the drive to mate is compromised in the absence of robust lordosis. Therefore, appetitive measures of sexual behavior (e.g., preferences, solicitation behaviors) are more specific and more sensitive indicators of sexual motivation than lordosis alone. Paradigms designed to study female sexual motivation often provide a female subject with the choice to interact with a sexually vigorous male or either a non-sexual partner (i.e., female, castrated male) or to remain alone. The study of appetitive measures of sexual motivation has elucidated the role of hormones in female sexual motivation, as well as the underlying neural pathways. The present review describes methods for studying female rats to advance our understanding of sexual motivation and sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Human sexuality has three main roots: biological, motivational-affective-relational, and cognitive. Unfortunately, in women, the biological dimension is usually disregarded. Hormones are necessary, but not sufficient, factors to maintain a satisfying human libido. In women, oestrogens prime the central nervous system, acting as neurotrophic and psychotrophic factors throughout life. They also prime the sensory organs, including the skin with its sebaceous and sweat glands, which are the key receptors for external sexual stimuli. Oestrogens are also the ‘permitting factors’ for the action of vaso-intestinal peptide, the key neurotransmitter involved in the endothelial and vascular changes leading to vaginal lubrication. Other factors, such as medication, alcohol and other health problems, can modify the biological impact of hormones on libido. Depression may cause a progressive decline in interest in sexual behaviour leading to low libido, difficulty in sexual arousal, secondary anorgasmia and/or frank sexual aversion. Increasing attention of doctors towards the sexual problems of women will dramatically improve female quality of life, especially during difficult periods Of transition.",

As such, sexual pleasure tends to be discounted or misunderstood by health care professionals. This is especially true for alternative or “unconventional” sexual practices, which do not fall within the realm of traditional “vanilla” sex. One example of alternative sexual practices is BDSM, which is an acronym for a broad range of sexual practices that focus on themes of bondage and discipline (B&D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism (SM). For the most part, research in this field has been quantitative and has focused on describing the people affiliated with BDSM, while overlooking the importance of the sexual acts themselves, as well as the subjective motivations and desires of these individuals, and how these personal differences are related to risk-taking and/or risk reduction in the context of public health. These factors need to be understood in order to design and implement more effective measures for the prevention of HIV and other STIs.",

      "abstract": "Workplace bullying and harassment is prevalent in contemporary workplaces with detrimental negative outcomes for targets as well as for bystanders and the organization itself. At any one time, some 3%–20% of the working population is targeted, suffering reduced motivation and productivity, severe mental and physical health problems, and a risk of exclusion from the organization and even working life altogether. Bullying and harassment is about the systematic and ongoing mistreatment of an employee by other organization members, mostly of a psychological and social nature and often involving a gradually escalating process that may end in severe victimization of those targeted if not properly managed and handled in its early phases. In early phases, by some denoted incivility, the behaviors involved are often subtle, indirect, and discrete, while in later phases they become ever more prevalent and direct—even involving threats and open verbal abuse. Bullying may involve work-related behaviors creating a difficult and even dangerous working situation for the target, personally demeaning behavior, acts of social exclusion and non-inclusion, and physically intimidation behaviors. Hence, bullying comes in many shades and forms, as well as at many levels of intensity. Although risk factors and antecedents of this complex problem may be found on many levels, factors in the immediate working environment and the design and management of work are particularly important. Furthermore, bullying is particularly prevalent in working environments characterized by a hostile working climate and in organizations where such behaviors are permitted or even rewarded.",

      "abstract": "Trachten we de gegevens van resultaten van de hoofdstukken III t/m VI met elkaar in verband te brengen, dan zien we het volgende:\r\nSubstraatstimuli in het gebied, waarin vrouwtjes voorkomen wekken balts en zoekgedrag bij het mannetje op. Ontmoet het mannetje sexe-genoten in dit milieu, dan reageert het agressief en raakt nu en dan in gevecht met de andere mannetjes. Hierbij heeft het grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde mannetje de grootste kans als overwinnaar uit het duel tevoorschijn te komen, Zijn gedrag verschilt dan duidelijk van dat van de verliezer. Zolang het mannetje niet heeft gecopuleerd blijft de kans, dat het wint van een bepaalde rivaal, die eveneens niet heeft gecopuleerd, betrekkelijk constant. Als het mannetje verliest bij het eerste treffen sluit dit nog niet uit, dat het van het andere mannetje kan winnen. Het zoekgedrag, dat na agressieve contacten wordt gemodificeerd tot marionettengang brengt het mannetje in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van vrouwtjes. Zoekgedrag wordt dan beeindigd en visuele prikkels (misschien ook olfactorische) richten het baltsgedrag op het vrouwtje.\r\nHet vrouwtje is waarschijnlijk bij de eerste ontmoeting nog niet tot paren bereid; de agonistische contacten tussen mannetjes duren dan voort. De grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren hebben daarbij de meeste kans de directe omgeving van het vrouwtje bezet te houden. Bepaalde factoren uit bet baltsgedrag waarschijnlijk vooral het ritme van bewegingen en vibraties immobiliseren het vrouwtje tenslotte, ten gevolge van aanraken door het mannetje of op grond van visuele prikkels treedt kanteling van het abdomen op. \r\nDan kruipt het mannetje op vormprikkels, afkomstig van het vrouwtje spelen hierbij een rol en de copulatie vindt plaats. Vrouwtjes, welke niet worden bevrucht, kunnen na drie maanden nog op de hierboven beschreven wijze tot paren bewogen worden. Bij bet mannetje daalt na een periode van sexuele activiteit de agressiviteit ten opzichte van andere mannetjes. Komt het in dit stadium tot een agonistisch contact tussen dit mannetje en een ander, dat nog geen periode van sexuele activiteit heeft doorgemaakt, dan treedt het laatste mannetje als winnaar op.\r\nVeldwaarnemingen zullen het hierboven getekende beeld nog moeten bevestigen. Net name de regels, welke voor het agonistische gedrag beschreven zijn kunnen met elkaar een belangrijk selectie-mechanisme vormen, waarbij selectie plaats vindt in de richting van sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren en misschien in de richting van grotere dieren. Het is van belang te weten, of dit mechanisme in de natuur inderdaad werkzaam is, of dat misschien het potentiele effect ervan door andere factoren in de leefwijze en het gedrag van Pardosa amentata wordt geneutraliseerd.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People with disabilities are ten times more likely to suffer from abuse than their typical peers. When lacking knowledge about abuse indicators, these persons are, evidently, unable to report it, which can lead to repeated abuse. Moreover, in many cases, these people do not know that they have the right to decide, refuse, be asked permission (every time), rethink a decision or change their minds. On the other hand, sexuality is often mistaken for sex. Actually, the concept of sexuality is much wider and includes identities, roles, intimacy, pleasure and spirituality. Sexual education and counseling must not be a one-time “talk” (that usually takes place during puberty), but a process of communication, counseling and support which starts at early ages, continues during the school years and goes further, during adulthood. The emotional, psycho-sexual, social, ethical and spiritual aspects also continue their development in the adult life and it is only natural to be properly approached at these ages as well.",

In order to concentrate on the most frequently encountered complaints of the sexually maladjusted fairly unit, this paper has been arbitrarily confined to detailed consideration of the clinical problem of impotence. Presuming a lack of spinal cord pathology and certain endocrinopathies, the physiologic systems of impotence have an almost constant psychogenic origin or background. Rarely, if ever, do pathologic lesions of the urethra develop physical symptoms of sexual impotence (Hyde, 1959). From a purely physiologic point of view there are three main types of male impotence that have been encountered clinically, both in sexually maladjusted and infertile males.",

Among a sample of 260 self-identified kinky users of a kink-oriented social networking website living in 21 countries, we examined self-reported narratives of the origins of kink desires. An inductive coding process by four independent coders yielded 20 categories of responses, organized into five broad discourses about the origins of kinky desires: identity (e.g., personality, personal taste, and role exploration; 72.7% of responses), nurture (e.g., both traumatic and non-traumatic life experiences; 38.1% of responses), negation (e.g., disavowing or doubting a particular idea about the origins of their kink interests; 24.6% of responses), nature (e.g., biology and genetics; 22.7% of responses), and uncertainty (e.g., not being able to identify an origin of kinky desires; 10.4% of responses). Fewer than 19% of participants mentioned any kind of trauma in their responses. We discuss implications for scientific understandings of kinky sexual desire within the umbrella of sexual diversity.",

Principle findings are that in spite of severe genito-sexual dysfunctions the majority continued having intercourse and about half felt orgasmic. Sexuality maintained its pre-injury significance for nearly all subjects, and most characterized their sexual lives as at least to some extent satisfactory. Loco-motor impairment and autonomous dysreflexia were more frequently given as causes of reduced sexual pleasure than were sexual dysfunctions. High spinal cord severance and lack of regular partner were negative factors for continuation of satisfying sexual experiences. Thus, genital sexual dysfunction is but one factor determining level of sexual satisfaction after a spinal cord trauma as many younger tetra- and paraplegics appear to be able to identify new and gratifying ways of sexual fulfillment.",

Nell'anno 2000 non e purtroppo difficile trovare sui quotidiani casi di intolleranza o di insofferenza verso queste persone: casi in cui, ad esempio, la persona handicappata, a causa dei parere contrario dei condominio, non riesce ad ottenere (od ottiene con grandi difficolta) l'installazione di un ascensore o di un servoscala, poiche rovinerebbe l'immagine, oppure casi di albergatori che non riescono a far occupare dalle persone senza disabilita fisiche le camere con bagni accessibili a tutti. Le stesse aziende produttrici fanno molta attenzione al modo in cui proporre prodotti accessibili a tutti paura di farli ricadere nella sottofascia per handicappati.\r\n E' pero altrettanto doveroso sottolineare come il diritto di fruire completamente dei luoghi e dei contesto in cui si vive, e espressamente previsto dall'ART. 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana, che recita: Tutti i cittadini hanno pari dignita sociale e sono eguali davanti alla legge, senza distinzioni di sesso, di razza, di lingua, di religione, di opinioni politiche, di condizioni personali e sociali.\r\n E' compito della repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale, che limitando di fatto le liberta e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini, impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica e sociale dei Paese. \r\n E' stata ritenuta utile una tesi di laurea su questo tema dopo aver riscontrato le grandi difficolta che i disabili devono superare nell'ambiente abitativo, sia quanto riguarda l'autonomia, sia la qualita della vita, in cui tutto e pensato unicamente con criteri ergonomici utenti non disabili.\r\n Gli ambienti domestici in cui si verificano le maggiori difficolta sono la cucina e il bagno. E' stato analizzato l'ambiente della cucina perche il bagno esistono diverse soluzioni progettuali.\r\n La tesi e stata sviluppata in due parti, una parte di ricerca, che ha fornito il sistema\r\n delle prestazioni richieste ed una di progetto, che ha soddisfatto le prestazioni\r\n richieste che si ritenevano prioritarie.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni richieste: sono state analizzate le esigenze emerse\r\n dall'intero sistema d'utenza e sono state illustrate tramite una sezione esplicativa\r\n accompagnata da degli elaborati grafici. In dettaglio:\r\n -Le complessita relative ai diversi tipi di utenza: l'utenza d'uso, di produzione, di\r\n gestione e sociale\r\n -Gli ausili necessari agli utenti disabili la deambulazione\r\n -I dati antropometrici degli utenti d'uso\r\n -Le tipologie ambientali ricorrenti in cucina\r\n -Le attrezzature indispensabili in cucina\r\n -Il lavoro che in cucina e necessario compiere durante la preparazione dei pasti.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite: il progetto\r\n -Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite si e tradotto, tramite alcuni elaborati grafici, in\r\n un prodotto di produzione industriale:\r\n una postazione che permette la preparazione dei cibi e il lavaggio delle\r\n stoviglie, con caratteristiche di flessibilita di installazione e di componenti,\r\n che permette l'utilizzo sia ad utenti disabili che ad utenti con mobilita non\r\n compromessa.\r\n Sulla base dei risultati della ricerca delle prestazioni richieste, eseguita nell'anno\r\n 1999, e stato sviluppato un progetto preliminare, costituito da elaborati grafici e\r\n tridimensionali che rappresentavano i vincoli e le prestazioni a cui il progetto doveva\r\n rispondere. Nel mese di gennaio 2000 e stato proposto a FRANKE S.p.A., nella\r\n persona dei Dott. Zeno Fontana, una collaborazione nello sviluppo industriale del\r\n progetto preliminare, che ha avuto la durata di circa un anno (gennaio- dicembre 2000) e che ha portato alla realizzazione di un prototipo ligneo in scala 1:1.",

Some of these are harmless, while others are not, robbing sufferers and possibly their partners of loving sexual relationship. At least 40 paraphilias have been named, but the full extent of the field, perhaps, is still undiscovered. Recent studies have reported many paraphilias as long-term effects of sexual abuse in childhood, and the more frequent and persistent the abuse is, the worse the long-term psychologic, behavioral, and relationship problems. Psychopathology within this group of disorders may lead to criminal behavior, ranging from infringement of decency to some of the most heinous crimes known.",

However, there is little qualitative research on how they themselves experience and interpret it. Based on interviews with 26 Taiwanese men, experiences of spermarche occurred due to: (1) sexual behavior; (2) nocturnal emission; (3) naïve self-exploration; and (4) masturbation were identified and examined. Findings reveal that ejaculation was experienced as a complex and dynamic process with diverse emotions which were entangled. In addition, it was understood not just as a biological phenomenon, but there are broader social, cultural and medical discourses that shape how these men feel and reflect on their first ejaculation experience. In the end, the contribution of this study to the research field of spermarche is suggested.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Perspective of Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder that is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions. OCD can occur in a wide range of subtypes, which may include sexual OCD, i.e., the occurrence of intrusive sexual thoughts. People with sexual OCD may experience unwanted obsessive sexual thoughts about a family member, dead or inanimate objects, animals, God, or children, which can range from mild to severe levels of occurrence. The psychodynamic perspective on OCD suggests that the content of obsessive thinking is commonly drawn from primitivized sexuality and aggression. It further suggests that in the absence of key relationships that include emotional proximity, mirroring and containment, and attunement, a child experiences a void-like state. Consequently, the anxiety that arises in the child leads to a form of liveliness in a “dead” inner world. However, it occurs out of a sense of abandonment and loss of good objects, and ultimately out of fear of annihilation. As a result, the child resorts to maladaptive defense mechanisms. The study attempts to explore the adverse early childhood experiences such as parental neglect, mother–father conflict, and lack of parental love and care leading to fixation in psychosexual stages of development, which further leads to the adoption of maladaptive defense mechanisms that in turn further contribute to the development of obsessional personality traits. This study aims to explain the psychodynamic perspective on the emergence of sexual obsessions by proceeding with a case study approach by taking a diagnosed case of OCD. A comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment was conducted with the help of Draw-a-Person Test, Thematic Apperception Test, Rotter’s Incomplete Sentence Blank, and Million’s Comprehensive Multiaxial Inventory. The analysis of the assessment protocol revealed a strong relationship between the defense mechanism, personality traits, and the development of obsessive symptoms.",

There is robust research and information regarding its biological aspects specially its endocrine base, yet the psychosocial aspect is quite interesting and debatable due to its variability among different cultures and climates. There are certain subthreshold response in form fear and loss of reproductive life to no more ability to reproduce and a feeling of loss of femininity. The period of menstruation simulated to reproductive age or fertility is around half of their lives; therefore, loss of fertility or reproductive life may be a source of stress specially among tribes where long reproductive age period is desired on the cultural belief that this will lead to a large family size that is considered as a symbol of success. Psychological factors such personal or inter-psychic (personality, self-esteem, and coping skills) and intra-psychic (relationship issues and social support) may contribute in the onset, course, and repose to perimenopausal period. There are certain psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome related to premenopausal period that must be screened. Before embarking on pharmacological treatment, psychosocial intervention especially lifestyle modifications must be offered to avoid complications.",

      "title": "Sexualisierte Gewalt gegen Kinder und Jugendliche – Definitionen",
      "abstract": "Im deutschsprachigen Raum existieren mehrere Begriffe und Definitionen, die versuchen, das Phänomen sexualisierter Gewalt zu beschreiben. Zwei weit verbreitete Definitionen stammen von Bange/ Deegener und Hageman-White und werden in diesem Kapitel vorgestellt. Alle Definitionen verbindet der Machtaspekt, der bei der Verübung sexualisierter Gewalt eine zentrale Rolle spielt. Der Begriff sexualisierte Gewalt betont zum einen den Gewaltaspekt und zum anderen, dass es sich nicht immer und nicht ausschließlich um einen Akt aus sexueller Lust handeln muss sondern, dass die Gewalt mit sexuellen Mitteln ausgeübt wird. Im Gegensatz zum Begriff des sexuellen Missbrauchs lässt er sprachlogisch nicht die Assoziation eines Gebrauchs der Sexualität von Kindern und Jugendlichen zu. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen können unangemessene Verhaltensweisen oder pädagogisches Fehlverhalten sein, die einmalig oder gelegentlich auftreten. Ob Handlungen sexuell grenzverletzend sind, entscheidet neben objektiven Kriterien, wie professionellen Arbeitsstandards, das subjektive Erleben von einer*m Betroffenen dieser Handlungen. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen im Rahmen einer Täter*innenstrategie unterscheiden sich damit von unbeabsichtigtem Verhalten durch den Vorsatz, in die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung einer*s Kindes oder Jugendliche*n einzugreifen. Dies stellt ein gravierendes Fehlverhalten dar, das die Schwelle zur Strafbarkeit überschreiten kann. Strafrechtlich relevante Formen sexualisierter Gewalt an Kindern und Jugendlichen werden im 13. Abschnitt des Strafgesetzbuches: \"Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung\" definiert. Für den Kontext sexualisierter Gewalt von Lehrer*innen gegenüber Schüler*innen ist insbesondere §174 \"Sexueller Missbrauch von Schutzbefohlenen\" relevant. Unabhängig davon, ob Gerichte eine sexuelle Handlung für strafrechtlich relevant halten, können Handlungen als grundlegende Differenzierung in zwei Kategorien eingeteilt werden: Handlungen mit direktem Körperkontakt (\"hands-on\") und Handlungen ohne direkten Körperkontakt (\"hands-off\"). Alle genannten Akte werden als sexualisierte Gewalt bezeichnet, wenn der*die Täter*in diese Handlungen ausführt oder er oder sie das Kind oder die*den Jugendliche*n dazu verleitet, entsprechend manipuliert oder zwingt, diese Akte selbst zu vollführen (z. B. orale Befriedigung des Täters bzw. der Täterin).",

      "abstract": "The terms \"sex,\" \"sexual,\" and \"sexuality\" are seldom defined with precision in the professional literature. Their meaning is generally left to a reader's intuitive understanding. The term sex may be used to indicate male or female anatomy, the general distinction between male and female genders or between distinctive masculine and feminine behaviors attributed to the two genders, to activities leading to orgasm (8,9) or to penile/vaginal intercourse and reproduction. Sexual and sexuality are used with equal imprecision, referring to the sexual organs, to functions of sexual organs, to sexual drives, or to instincts. Gender, gender identity, and gender roles, on the other hand, have precise definitions derived from recent conceptualizations in psychosexual research. Gender usually indicates the equivalent of male or female anatomic sex. Gender identity refers to one's personally experienced sexual identity, a persistent individual self-awareness of being either male or female without regard to how or with whom one expresses this identity. Gender role involves everything one says or does to indicate his/her gender identity to others (11).",

Parental permission had been obtained. The children's emotional, behavioural and overall play responses were rated Whilst the dolls’ difference from other dolls was dearly noticed, they did not traumatize the children, most of whom incorporated the dolls in imaginative play. Only five children's play with the dolls showed any sexualized quality, in three the source of sexual knowledge becoming apparent. Whereas the absence of sexualized play does not reliably exclude abuse, we suggest that explicit sexual play with the dolls may well arise from previous exposure: to explicit sexual information or activity.",

      "title": "Sexual Addiction or Hypersexual Disorder: Different Terms for the Same Problem? A Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Sexual addiction, which is also known as hypersexual disorder, has largely been ignored by psychiatrists, even though the condition causes serious psychosocial problems for many people. A lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, people who were categorized as having a compulsive, impulsive, addictive sexual disorder or a hypersexual disorder reported having obsessive thoughts and behaviors as well as sexual fantasies. Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/ hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches. Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities that frequently occur with sexual addiction should be integrated into the therapeutic process. Group-based treatments should also be attempted. Keywords: Sexual addiction, sex addict, sexual dependence, impulsivity, compulsive sexual behavior, compulsive sex, sexual compulsion, excessive sexual behavior, hypersexual, and hypersexuality",

As a rule the homosexual is not able to give up the object of his pleasure, and one cannot convince him that if he changed to the other object he would find again the pleasure that he has renounced. The girl's inversion, however, received its final reinforcement when she found in her 'Lady' an object which promised to satisfy not only her homosexual tendency, but also that part of her heterosexual libido still attached to her brother. Homosexual enthusiasms, unduly strong friendships tinged with sensuality, are common enough in both sexes during the first years after puberty. The cases of male homosexuality in which Steinach has been successful fulfilled the condition, which is not always present, of a very patent physical 'hermaphroditism'.",

Regardless of one's role in providing care to patients, most practitioners do not have experience about discussing sexuality and intimacy in a frank, direct, and authentic manner. Addressing sexuality issues early on in the assessment and treatment of the patient allows the practitioner to open up a line of communication with the patient so that these issues can be addressed as they come up in the future.

      "abstract": "PHASE ONE: THE BUILD-UP PHASE The first phase is characterized by minor battering incidents and/or and emotional abuse over imagined or real infractions of rules and expectations of the male partner. The woman sometimes responds calmly, trying to de-escalate the situation or she may attempt to defend her position in the relationship. They may both attempt to rationalize away his behavior as stress reactions related to work or finances, etc. Often the woman believes her adapting behavior will act to control his violence. This tension building phase time lapse varies greatly from the relationship to relationship. For some it may be days or weeks, for others there may be years of tension building between acute incidents. As the tension builds, her coping skills may become less and less effective at protecting herself or de-escalating the tension. It is during this phase that women will often reach out for help or support since they are aware of the increasing danger. Other than services designed for battered women, many community services do not recognize her need at this stage since there is not “evidence of violence.”",

      "title": "Anal manipulation as a source of sexual pleasure",
      "abstract": "Manipulation of the anus can produce sensations that are perceived to be pleasurable by certain individuals and may be interpreted as sexual sensations. Anal erotic activities have been noted in the professional literature and in popularised sex manuals, but a detailed accounting of these activities and statistics on their prevalence have not been well quantified. Much of the literature tends to generalise anal sexuality into anal intercourse, resulting in few publications on other anal activities. Because of the perceived cultural unpleasantness of the subject, researchers and subjects are reluctant to discuss more than cursory references to any such activity; however, recent social surveys have indicated that there may a higher level of interest in these activities than might be suspected. Anal manipulation, also known as anal masturbation, may be performed either as a prelude to other sexual activities or may be enjoyed as an activity in itself. It may be performed with a sex partner or as a form of autoeroticism, either independently or in conjunction with genital masturbation. This paper reviews anatomical, physiological and psychological aspects of anal masturbation. Methods include manipulation by the fingers, dildos and vibrators, and the insertion of small objects into the anus and rectum. Some of these activities are potentially hazardous, producing either internal physical damage or the introduction of pathogenic organisms. An extensive list of references on all these topics is included for readers to explore further aspects of the subject. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s the increase in erotic entertainment has conveyed a clear message: the more sex the better.This has resulted in myths about sexual norms, which if believed may lead to behaviour result- ing in the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases or in sexual dysfunction, or both.The psychosexual problems seen in departments of genitourinary medicine are either secondary to sexually acquired infection or primarily psychological. General reactionsWhen genital lesions are seen, felt, or suspected most patients lose interest in sexual intercourse, or at least restrain themselves for fear of infecting their partners.Those disinhibited by drugs or alcohol or of a psychopathic nature may, however, continue to have inter- course, and particular care must be taken to explain the dangers to others of such behaviour.Marital discord-The innocently infected partner ofa patient who has had intercourse outside a stable relationship may realise the implications of a sexually transmitted disease but may not want the diagnosis spelt out.The doctor therefore should not force the diagnosis on the patient but give him or her room to manoeuvre by saying, for instance, \"Is there anything more you would like to know?\".Often the answer is \"No.\"Anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression-Under the stress of having a sexually transmitted disease the extravert may become angry and the introvert anxious or depressed.Anger may be directed at the clinic staff as well as the person who transmitted the infection.Recognition of this anger may allow the doctor to intervene and discuss the facts and feelings surrounding a patient's illness.This may prevent later violence towards the patient's sexual partner.Unfortunately, in the case of the psychopath such intervention may not alter the patient's strong feelings or the outcome.The neurotic introvert is more likely to become anxious or depressed under stress, particularly when he or she has had intercourse outside a stable relationship.When severe these symptoms must be taken seriously.Clinical anxiety may be dealt with by letting the patient voice his feelings, and later by reassurance.In some patients the anxiety is so severe that a short course ofbenzodiazepines (such as diazepam 2 mg three times a day) may need to be given.Guilt and depression often go together, though most cases of depression seen in clinics are not severe; if necessary antidepressants such as mianserin 30-60 mg at night may be given; the dose should be built up slowly to prevent undue sleepiness in a working person.When the depression is deeper, psychiatric help should be enlisted, but the patient may refuse unless the psychiatrists are on the spot at the clinic.A clinically trivial condition such as recurring non-gonococcal urethritis, as well as the more serious problems of genital herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute epididymitis, and hepatitis B, may all cause anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression.Allowing such patients to air their feelings is vital.",

      "abstract": "Most first-time mothers experience a decline in both their sexual and relationship satisfaction from prepregnancy, which has negative consequences for the couple and their family. Prior studies have begun to identify risk and protective factors (e.g., empathy) for postpartum sexual and relationship satisfaction. Causal attributions for postpartum sexual concerns may be important because a specific cause can be difficult to pinpoint given the wide range of postpartum sexual problems among first-time parents. In the current study, 120 first-time mothers (3–12 months postpartum) completed validated measures assessing attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Attributions were measured on four dimensions: internal/external (i.e., is the sexual concern due to the self or the situation), stable/unstable (i.e., will the cause of the concern occur again in the future), global/specific (i.e., will the cause of the concern affect other situations), and partner responsibility (i.e., is the partner the cause). When new mothers reported more stable and partner attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, they were less sexually satisfied, and when they attributed greater responsibility for sexual concerns to their partners, they were less satisfied with their overall relationship. These associations remained significant after controlling for potential challenges that may also impact sexual and relationship satisfaction during this period (i.e., breastfeeding, sexual frequency, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sexual functioning). As postpartum sexual concerns are common, attributions for these changes may be a valuable target for interventions aimed at strengthening the intimate relationships of women making the transition to parenthood.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric and psychological testing are used extensively in both clinical and research contexts, with the goal of providing an objective indication of the construct being measured. At the same time, it has long been recognized that there is no such thing as a culture free or even fair test, to the extent that cultural bias-the constant and systematic statistical error due not to chance but to ethnic group membership-can seriously undermine the validity of a psychological or psychiatric test. The very construct being measured may not have a culturally compatible equivalent, or, relatedly, the behavior sampled in a given item or combination of items may not be associated with the construct in question in the same way across all cultures. In addition the means by which the behavior is sampled-the instrument construction, the sorts of questions or their structure, for example-can vary in familiarity across cultures. Finally, the individual items themselves may be poorly or ambiguously translated, may be predicated on specific cutlural norms, or, indeed, the meaning of the item can vary cross-culturally. Finally, sampling bias pertains to the representativeness of the sample, however, this is all the more complex given that constructs such as “race”, “ethnic group” and so forth are often poorly defined and ambiguous, and thus who is and who is not included in a given group may further undermine the validity of the test. Despite these difficulties, concrete steps can be taken to increase the cultural validity of the test used.",

      "title": "Psychological Assessment and Therapy for the Spinal-Cord-Injured Patient",
      "abstract": "Disorders of sexual function occur frequently in patients with spinal cord injury, but have not until very recently been studied in a systematic fashion. The frequent occurrence of this disorder is clearly related to the fact that the sexual organs are directly controlled by components at all levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral hemispheres. In addition, it must be emphasized that sexuality is not just a biologic function, but also has complex psychological and social aspects. The work of ethnologists, such as Lorenz (25), has shown this to be true for most animal species. In humans, this aspect of sexuality appears to be particularly important. Small children, when asked to identify themselves, often respond by saying, \"I'm a boy\" or \"I'm a girl,\" their gender providing a source of personal identification. Frequently, how well individuals perform sexually determines how much of a \"man\" or a \"woman\" they see themselves to be. Given this system of beliefs with respect to the emphasis on sexuality and sexual performance, a great deal of anxiety becomes attached to situations in which sexual behavior is expected. These added meanings and expectations impart considerable importance to sexual behavior and have contributed to the fact that human sexuality consists of much more than reproductive function. These factors may help explain why sexual functions are highly vulnerable to all types of severe and chronic diseases, particularly diseases of the nervous system, which so frequently disrupt motor behavior.",

And are women's sexual interests nonetheless sensitive to hormonal changes across the cycle? This chapter explores these issues, and emphasizes several themes: (a) Women appear to have retained a form of fertile‐phase estrus, which shares functional and physiological underpinnings with estrus of other primates; (b) a key unresolved question is whether nonconceptive sexual interests are a diminished form of estrous interests (the graded sexuality model) or have been shaped to have distinct functions (the extended sexuality model); (c) whether and how women's estrous sexual interests have been modified since the evolution of pairbonding also remains unresolved; (d) women are subtly more attractive during the fertile phase, but likely as a by‐product of hormonal variations and not because women signal their fertility status.",

      "title": "Development of Sexuality in Female Children and Adolescents<sup>*</sup>",
      "abstract": "Female sexuality (meaning sexual desire, excitement and orgasm) has been of considerable interest in psychiatry. Women's efforts to define and legitimize their own experience of their sexuality have increased in the past 25 years. However, the integration of these new views into the body of psychiatric (especially psychoanalytic) theory has not occurred very actively or successfully. Very little is known about the development of sexuality in childhood and adolescence. This paper looks at various behaviours, interests and events in women's lives that might reveal something about the development of their sexuality. The literature on female masturbation is reviewed and some sex differences highlighted. The literature on interest in babies, the wish to have babies, and menarche is explored for possible associations with sexuality. Rather than sexuality being a central organizer of experience, it seems quite possible that experience is an organizer of sexuality. Therefore, to better understand female sexuality we need to consider the impact of experiences during childhood and adolescence.",

      "abstract": "A central belief within the sexual abuse recovery literature is that childhood\nsexual abuse (CSA) is a devastating experience that inevitably has devastating\nlong-term eﬀects, allowing for the idea that ‘knowledge’ or ‘memories’ can\nbe recovered from the minds and bodies of victims. For many women who\nenter adulthood with no memory of CSA, coming to ‘know’ they were\nabused relies on a redeﬁnition of memory to include not only ‘recall memory’\nbut also ‘alternative memories’ such as imagistic memory, body memory,\nfeeling memory and acting-out memory (Fredrickson, 1992; Herman, 1992;\nWhitﬁeld, 1995). These memories, often shown as lists of symptoms, can take\nthe form of dreams and ﬂashbacks, physical or bodily experiences, feelings\nsuch as sadness or anxiety and other events or diﬃculties experienced in\nadulthood. They are often said to be held by an inner child, or children, who\nmay be stuck at the time of the abuse and inﬂuence the thoughts, feelings\nand behaviours of adult victims. Alternative memories occupy a central\nposition in the sexual abuse recovery literature but there are many other\ninterpretations for such symptoms. It is only because they are deﬁned as such\nwithin this literature that these ‘symptoms’ can be identiﬁed as ‘memories’ of\nsexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a highly prevalent, age-related disorder which has a significant impact on the quality of life and social well- being of both the patient and the partner. It is a progressive disease associated with many vascular and cardiac risk factors. The subject of sexual dysfunction is more widely discussed in the media as a result of newer therapies that have become available in the past decade. Therefore, men and women of all ages are seeking assistance to improve their sexual relationships. Male sexual dysfunction refers to a problem with one or more of the four components of male sexual function, i.e. libido, erection, ejaculation or orgasm, that interferes with the ability or interest to engage in sexual intercourse. Psychological and physical factors as well as drugs may affect male sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes, related to desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. This article focuses mainly on erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. However, it is important to remember that the sexual partner plays an integral role in the successful and effective management of the ED patient.",

      "title": "Editorial: Defining and Regulating the Boundaries of Sex and Sexuality",
      "abstract": "Sex and sexuality are contentious concepts, blending the deeply personal with the profoundly political. They concern most of us in our private spaces of fantasy and meaning, relationships and families, pleasure and pain, creation and loss. But sex and sexuality are not solely private matters; with conceptual boundaries moving and being transgressed, they have increasingly been brought into public life and contested in the courts.1 Should we press on with this use of the law, or not? This special issue of the Medical Law Review looks at cutting-edge medical and legal aspects of sex and sexuality. Sex, a biological classification of human, other mammalian, and non-mammalian bodies, has extensive sociopolitical and cultural baggage beyond its putative function of referring to (and drawing divisions on the basis of) clusters of reproduction-related bodily features. Sexuality, by which we mean the whole landscape of one’s sexual desires and activities, has also been decoupled from reproduction in various ways over the last half-century or more. Section II offers an explanation of the biological territory on which current arguments and future legal cases may be fought (and can be skipped by those with a detailed understanding of the science already). Section III considers regulation. In Section IV, we explain some difficult choices facing us as a society and the interaction of the various articles in this issue.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Although the criteria for the sexual disorders are relatively straightforward, they hint at the challenge of categorizing sexual problems. For example, a diagnostic system that intends to meaningfully describe sexual dysfunction must take into consideration the broad range of normal sexual response. The system must take into account the fact that dysfunction and distress depend heavily on the individual's expectations, wishes, and opportunities regarding sexual activity (as well as those of his or her partner). It should consider the effects of aging. It should consider the effects of proscriptive societal and religious norms on sexual behavior as well as take into account what it means to sexually function as a man or woman (or elsewhere on the modern gender continuum). The system should also take into account medications and illnesses that predictably reduce sexual desire and/or function, as well as those that predictably intensify desire and/or function, in addition to the reality that most assessments of sexual function and dysfunction are incomplete without an understanding that although sexual response has a biological underpinning, it is experienced from intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural perspectives. In that biopsychosocial context, making a diagnosis of, for example, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is potentially more complicated than briefly exploring whether the patient is interested in having sex. DSM-5 identifies eight sexual dysfunctions, four specific to men, three specific to women, and one that can apply to either gender (substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction). DSM-5 terminology and criteria vary somewhat between the genders. For example, men may have erectile disorder and/or male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, but for women, the somewhat comparable condition is merged into female sexual interest/arousal disorder. DSM-5-TR addresses the fact that both men and women can have difficulties with orgasm. Whereas women may meet criteria for female orgasmic disorder, men may be diagnosed with either delayed ejaculation or premature (early) ejaculation. Women can also have genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, a diagnosis that is new to DSM-5 and that was developed in response to the increasing recognition that the prior diagnoses of vaginismus and dyspareunia were highly comorbid and difficult to distinguish. In addition, as is generally the case in DSM-5, there are categories for clinical presentations that either do not quite meet criteria or are incomplete (i.e., other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction). Except for substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, all of the sexual dysfunctions require a minimum duration of 6 months. In addition, each disorder can be noted to be lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational. If a medical condition is deemed pertinent, it can be listed as a specifier, but DSM-5 has specifically excluded the previous diagnosis of sexual dysfunction due to a medical condition because of the view that most of the sexual dysfunctions can be attributable to both psychological and biological factors. The sexual dysfunction diagnoses are applicable to gender-diverse individuals. In particular, DSM-5-TR encourages clinician judgment when assessing sexual dysfunctions among transgender, nonbinary, agender, and other individuals who may not appear to fit this chapter's categories. When the diagnosis is based on anatomy (e.g., erectile dysfunction), DSM-5-TR guides the clinician to base the diagnosis on the person's current anatomy rather than on the sex assigned at birth.",

      "abstract": "The data on the effect of the absence or presence of orgasm on the representation in the domain of self-awareness of women of sexual and emotional experience at different age stages is given. 429 women with an average age of sexual debut 18,220,12 years were surveyed anonymously. Between the ages of 18 and 24, 179 women had regularly experienced orgasm, but 37 had not. At the age of 25-60, 186 women had experienced orgasm, and 27 had not. We used the method of sampling experiences. The women noted the signs consistent with their usual experiences during “normal” intercourse. It has been established that the appearance of an orgasm before 25 years of age strengthens and reinforces psychological satisfaction, inner comfort, meeting expectations, sexual interest, intensity of reaction and acceptance of what is happening, weakens dysphoria and shame. At the age of over 25 years, appearance of an orgasm maximally stimulates sexual interest, intensity of response, acceptance of what is happening, sharpness of perception, reduces shame and weakens physical discomfort more strongly. The absence of an orgasm before the age of 25 does not have a bright negative effect. After 25 years, this, first of all, leads to a decrease in sexual interest and mood, increased shame, guilt, hopelessness, and disruption of interpersonal interaction.",

Indicators of emotional abuse can be the child's fearfulness, tics, stuttering, insecurity, etc... Sexual abuse includes kissing, touching genitals or breasts, sexual intercourse, oral and anal contact, viewing and showing pornographic magazines and films or other pornographic material.

      "title": "Pornographic Films and Unconscious Homosexual Desires: An Hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The possibility that heterosexual behavior may serve to gratify unconscious homosexual desires has been noted. Blanchard (1959) , for example, discussed group rape and noted that the sharing of a female for sexual purposes in one another's presence might well gratify unconscious homosexual desires of the males cornmicting the sexual assault. Men who have certain heterosexual preferences (such as anal intercourse or female partners who have masculine characteristics) may also be gratifying unconscious homosexual desires. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a similar inference could be made about males who habitually attend heterosexual pornographic films. In a typical cinema in which pornographic films are shown, the audience is usually completely male, alchough no studies of the composiuon af audiences have been p u b lished. Most likely, a man watches these films in the presence of other men. If there is a period of live entertainment (dancing or sexual intercourse), the men typically move closer to the front for this, thereby sitting in close proximity. The content of pornographic films emphasizes close-up views of penises. Fellatio is prominent. All ejaculations are shown and the semen visible. There are also close-up views of the genital areas during intercourse. Aside from a few views of the female face and breast, the content is very similar to that of homosexual films, in which views of fellatio and intercourse also comprise most of the film. Heterosexual films also contain episodes in which one female services several males at one time, with a combination of fellatio, vaginal intercourse, and anal inrercourse. In these scenes, several men are sharing the same female, much as occurs in group rape, but of course without the use of force on an unwilling female. The audience, though not active participants, may be seen as passive participants. The theme of heterosexual pornographic films is that the males get pleasure. The females, though supposed to be enjoying the sexual activity, are used for male gratification. The films may be conceptualized as gloriFying the male penis and the male orgasm If it is correct to suspect that heterosexual pornographic films do gratify unconscious homosexual desires, then it might be hypothesized that males who habitually watch such films would give evidence of unconscious concerns as manifest, for example, in sexual impotency or on objective tests of unconscious homosexual desires that have been devised (Lester, 1974). Such studies have not yet been conducted.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "The sexual abuse of children is not a new phenomenon, but the traumatic short- and long-term mental health consequences make it essential to study and, ultimately, prevent. The labels for child sexual abuse (CSA) vary and have changed over time, examples being “child sexual abuse,” “child sexual assault,” “child sexual exploitation” and “unwanted sexual experiences.” Each has slightly different meanings and implications. Researchers, practitioners, criminal justice personnel, and policymakers also differ on how to define other aspects of CSA (e.g., age of the child, age differential between child and offender, what acts constitute CSA [touch or penetration only, or non-touch such as exposure to pornography], and risk factors that may become targets of prevention strategies). Such definitional debates impact all aspects of studying the concept, such as examining prevalence, assessment, and clinical interventions. Whether the perpetrators are known to the child (true in the majority of cases) or are strangers affects the length of time that the child is victimized sexually and whether and how they disclose the abuse. The sexual abuse of boys, while a relatively small proportion of sexual victimizations, was not given the attention it warranted until relatively recently. Perpetrators are both males and females (an estimated 20 percent), but the type of CSA differs based on the sex of the offender. Special circumstances in which CSA occurs include the abuse of children in institutions and the CSA of children with disabilities. Disclosing CSA is difficult for many children and, rather than directly disclosing, many mention the abuse indirectly or much later on. Once disclosed, intervention typically consists of child protection services assessment and trauma-focused counseling. Child advocacy centers (CACs) have become the standard agencies to investigate and support CSA victims and non-offending family members. There are a number of ways to provide CSA prevention programs, such as media education, but the most common approach is educating children about the risks and teaching them strategies that may assist them in avoiding abusers or seeking assistance early on. The launch of the Internet has introduced new ways to sexually abuse children, with easier access to child pornography, abuse in real time, and trafficking children for commercial sexual exploitation.",

      "title": "ATTITUDINAL DISTINCTIONS OF SOLO SEX ENGAGERS AMONG OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Solo sex gets little attention in the research on sexual activity of older adults as most studies frame definitions around partnered sexual behaviors. This does not reflect the reality of many older adults who lack active sexual partners due to death, dysfunction, or serious illness. When solo sex is included in studies, they rarely go beyond frequency. The aim of this study was to determine how sexually active older adults view solo sex, its importance, and attitude distinctions between solo sex engagers and non-engagers through survey research with a sample over age 60 (N=556). The majority (58%) of older adults engage in solo sex with men more likely (67%) than women (53%). As expected, solo sex engagers are twice as likely to use sexual toys and to be interested in using them if they currently do not. More solo sex engagers (70%) view orgasms as being extremely/very important for a good sexual experience than non-engagers (55%). Positive sexual outlooks correlate with solo sex as 80% of engagers anticipate an unlimited number of future orgasms compared to 65% of non-engagers. The most striking attitude distinction is 72% of engagers believe solo sex can be “great sex” compared to only 39% of non-engagers. Solo sex has psychological and physiological benefits for older adults and this study demonstrates solo sex correlates with positive sexual attitudes. The findings of this study highlight the need for further attention to the importance of solo sex for older adults and how it relates to positive sexual health.",

The latter individuals may be seen multiple times for foreign body ingestions and insertions. Normal adults may sometimes be subject to foreign body injuries because they are engaged in criminal activities, or because they are subjected to spouse abuse or child abuse.

      "abstract": "This discussion of psychosexual factors in infertility focuses on the following: sexual dysfunctions in infertility (impotence ejaculatory impotence premature ejaculation vaginismus orgasmic dysfunction); coital factors in infertility (coital frequency coital error effluvium seminis coital technique); effect of infertility on psychosexual function; clinical aspect of psychosexual problems and infertility; and management. The importance of sexual problems as a cause of male infertility has been emphasized by Dubin and Amelar (1972). The etiology of sexual dysfunction is primarily psychogenic but functional and organic pathology may also be involved. If primary sexual failure occurs in 1 partner it can produce dysfunction in the other. Sexual dysfunctions usually are psychosomatic disorders. Both the vasocongestive and the orgasmic components of the sexual response may be inhibited together or separately. Macleods study indicates that at almost any age the chance of conception being achieved in less than 6 months rises with the frequency of intercourse yet Dubin and Amelar reported 6 cases of male infertility due to too frequent ejaculations. Daily ejaculation may have no clinically significant effect on the sperm count of a man who normally has a high sperm concentration. Effluvium seminis is a common phenomenon and is not a cause of infertility but a woman cleaning or douching herself immediately after intercourse is not encouraged for subfertile women. The best coital position for achieving conception is that of the male above with the female lying supine underneath. Infertile couples undergo much stress when they are unable to conceive. Many couples may find that their sexual pleasure and functioning become impaired. Infertile couples may have abnormalities in sexual functioning which can present in several ways: as psychosexual problems causing infertility; as infertility resulting in psychosexual dysfunction; or as incidental findings of psychosexual disturbances in cases of infertility. In the management of infertility associated with psychosexual problems the doctor must have an empathic understanding and nonjudgemental attitude and should be ready to encourage the couple to speak openly about their anxiety in a relaxed confidential and private setting. The couples attitudes concerning sexual behavior must be identified and help must be provided to modify them when appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Sex counseling is needed because those people with sexual problems tend to magnify the problems and dwell on them at the cost of all the other important activities of day to day living. The topics covered in sex counseling include impotence (62.5%), premature ejaculation (11.7%), ejaculation dysfunction (13.0%) in case of male, and frigidity (19.1%), sexual aversion/fear (23.0%), and functional disorders of sexual organs (22.4%) in case of female. Frigidity and vaginismus as well as most male problems are within the scope of sex counseling and therapy, but many of the female complaints are psychological and they require marriage counseling. Sexual awareness is both inherited and acquired. 6 weeks after fertilization the presence or absence of Y chromosome already begins to influence both structural and functional development of fetus, and its influence continues throughout our lives. Free creative expression of sexual awareness is bound to clash with social conventions, and that conflict causes stress in some individuals and maturity in others. Positive handling of sexuality promises enriched lives, and sex counseling contributes toward that goal.",

      "abstract": "Ray Bachtian Rangkuti (* Nurmalawaty (** Mohammad Ekaputra (*** Hukum positif di Indonesia tidak memandang semua hubungan kelamin diluar perkawinan sebagai zina (overspel). Perbuatan zina menurut KUHP hanya meliputi mereka yang melakukan persetubuhan atas dasar suka sama suka tanpa ada unsur paksaan, kekerasan dan ancaman kekerasan, KUHP juga memandang ada suatu perbuatan yang melakukan persetubuhan dengan daya paksa, kekerasan, atau ancaman kekerasan, yaitu delik pemerkosaan, Tindak pidana pemerkosaan ironisnya tidak hanya berlangsung di lingkungan luar atau tempat-tempat tertentu yang memberikan peluang manusia berlainan jenis dapat berkomunikasi, namun juga dapat terjadi di lingkungan sekitar yang seharusnya menjadi tempat memperoleh perlindungan. Pada hakikatnya korban tidak dapat melindungi diri sendiri dari berbagai macam tindakan yang menimbulkan kerugian mental, fisik, sosial dalam berbagai bidang kehidupan dan penghidupan. Kejahatan seksual sekarang ini merebak dengan segala bentuk. Khususnya pada kasus pemerkosaan, pelaku tidak mengenal lagi status, pangkat, pendidikan, jasmani, dan usia korban. Bahkan banyak juga yang tega memperkosa orang yang dalam keadaan tidak berdaya, baik secara fisik maupun mental. Semua ini dilakukan apabila mereka merasa terpuaskan hawa nafsunya. Demikian juga usia pelaku yang tidak mengenal batas usia. Pada penulisan skripsi ini, penulis menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normative melalui studi pustaka (Library search). Sumber hukum dalam penulisan skripsi ini adalah bahan hukum primer, yaitu Undang-undang, bahan hukum sekunder yaitu buku yang relevan dan putusan pengadilan, serta bahan hukum sekunder yang bersumber dari artikel, majalah, internet, dan lain-lain. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwasanya pelaku pemerkosaan dapat dikenakan pasal 285 KUHP, tetapi jika korban adalah orang yang tidak berdaya maka dikenakan pasal 286 KUHP, ditambah lagi jika perbuatan tersebut dilakukan secara berkesinambungan, maka akan ditambah pemberatan atas perbuatan pidana tersebut. Maka dari itu peran pengadilan terutama hakim sangat menentukan dalam proses penegakkan keadilan, hakim dituntut bijaksana, adil dan jeli dalam menjatuhkan pidana bukan hanya melihat dari sisi pelaku tapi juga dari sisi korban.",

      "title": "Looked after and adopted children: applying the latest science to complex biopsychosocial formulations",
      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‘trauma and attachment issues’ with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‘attachment problems’ for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‘attachment problems’, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‘one size fits all’ and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children’s whole life experiences are understood.",

Problems of sexual arousal in women are now recognized to mirror erectile dysfunction in men in many ways and assessment of cardiovascular disease should form part of the routine assessment of women presenting with sexual problems of lack of vaginal arousal (including lubrication) or clitoral arousal. However, psychosocial issues can predominate and perpetuate sexual problems for women and often require concurrent assessment. The sexual difficulties may be concurrent to erectile dysfunction or another sexual problem in the man. An offer of multiple interventions should be recommended where indicated.",

Pain during sex was defined as early as the 1800s, long before current medical terminologies of dyspareunia and vaginismus even came into the practice [1, 2]. Studies indicate that the prevalence of sexual pain disorders (3–46%) seems to vary from culture to culture and also with respect to the setting in which a diagnosis is made. Several authors found discrepancies in the reported incidence of sexual pain disorders, which depended on whether the patient was self-reporting a particular problem or whether the clinician was actively questioning the patient on the sexual dysfunction [3, 4]. This is not surprising, since data indicates that only 52% of women actually ever receive a formal diagnosis of a sexual pain disorder [5]. Sexual pain disorders have been frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.",

      "title": "Wasting Time as a Cultural Practice in Contemporary Serbia",
      "abstract": "The expression \"wasting time\" is a colloquial label for periods of time spent waiting to receive services in various social situations in which people find themselves in state or private institutions, such as the Ministry of Internal Affairs or health institutions, banks and technical inspections of vehicles, etc. In this way, the superiority of social or cultural time over individual time is manifested. Cultural use of time represents the tendency to manage linear time by repeating events anchored in certain time segments, such as rituals, music festivals, sports events, or national holidays. Individuals perceive time based on cultural learning, understanding sociocultural time as a framework for organizing their personal time. This means that when they are not engaged in activities arising from collective time, individuals tend to organize their time according to their personal needs and intentions - as much as possible.Wasting time is therefore perceived as time not spent on activities related to work or free time that are the consequence of personal choice or existential necessity. The term most often refers to the waiting periods, which are apparently not regarded as integral to completing a task, such as a medical examination or obtaining personal documents. The concept of wasting time emerges as an uncreative, imposed, wasted time spent on completing tasks that could be organized differently. It is an empty time, devoid of important events and which is contrasted with periods of activity. The idea of ​​wasting time corresponds to the personal experience of time. The given expression is a consequence of evaluating whether or not a certain period of time was spent usefully, viewed from a personal perspective. Everyone's experience suggests that time seems to pass more slowly when we can do nothing but wait. The networking of such experiences, arising from a multitude of social situations that impose prolonged waiting as a procedural part to obtain what is considered useful or necessary for individuals, can be characterised as a cultural practice. The contributors to this practice include all social institutions that provide services to users through direct contact and hold a societal monopoly of performing their activities.",

This attack is defined by [4] as “a communication process by which a perpetrator applies affinity seeking strategies, while simultaneously engaging in sexual desensitization and information acquisition about targeted victims in order to develop relationships that result in need fulfillment” (e.g. physical sexual molestation).

      "abstract": "La menstruación es un proceso biológico e involuntario vivenciado por mujeres cis, varones trans, personas no binarias y algunas personas de determinados espectros de la intersexualidad por aproximadamente cuarenta años. Se constituye también como un fenómeno histórico-social susceptible a elementos culturales que influyen en la forma en que se construyen las representaciones sociales que se elaboran sobre ella. Dichas representaciones no son ajenas al impacto de las marcas androcéntricas y el orden cisheteropatriarcal que ha permeado desde la cotidianidad hasta la producción de conocimiento científico. Lo anterior conlleva a que hayan prevalecido representaciones negativas de la sangre menstrual vinculadas a crisis de higiene, efectos negativos, cambios emocionales, estigmatización, ocultamiento, tabú, entre otros. No obstante, en las últimas décadas, epistemologías otras han permitido el surgimiento y la visibilización de narrativas y lenguajes que han facilitado no solo la elaboración de representaciones más positivas y críticas, sino también la comprensión de la menstruación como un fenómeno que no solo es vivido por las mujeres. Por tal motivo, en el presente artículo se pretende realizar una breve revisión de las marcas androcéntricas encontradas en algunas disciplinas científicas y en la sociedad en sí misma. Asimismo, busca resaltar las nuevas perspectivas como formas de resistencia epistémica y las herramientas, como las epistemologías feministas, que pueden marcar un camino en la re-apropiación de la menstruación por parte de quienes la viven.",

But perhaps the central nexus between social movements and sexuality occurs among people who have organized around the implications of sexual difference.

      "abstract": "Although rates of sexual aggression are high among college men who engage in heavy drinking, little is known regarding how often heavy drinking college men initiate unwanted sexual advances towards women that could lead to a potential sexual assault or the reasons why these advances stop or proceed. The present study describes heavy drinking college men’s ( N = 210) initiation of unwanted sexual and social advances towards women, as well as outcomes of these interactions, including how often these behaviors continue, and men’s perception of what stopped the behavior over a 3-month period. Men indicated whether they were in a situation where a sexual partner noted that she does not want sexual activity to proceed further, initiated unwanted sexual contact, initiated unwanted sexual intercourse, attempted to give a woman alcohol when she did not appear to want to drink, or attempted to take a woman to an isolated location when she did not appear to want to go. These unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped because of women’s verbal resistance (i.e., saying “stop” or “no”), or because men engaged in a discussion regarding the women’s limits or choices. Given that none of the unwanted sexual or social advances stopped because of bystander intervention, the present study highlights the importance of raising awareness of the effectiveness of women’s resistance tactics and continuing to train bystanders to notice and take action to address risky situations.",

      "abstract": "Summary From among 11 female cases of idiopathic sexual precocity, 3 have been chosen to exemplify advancement, delay, and normality, respectively, of psychological maturity in relation to chronological age. Like the other cases, they also exemplify coincidence between degree of maturity and variety of life experiences encountered and transacted. Sexually, their psychological development was not predetermined as some sort of automatic or instinctive adjunct to maturation of somatic sexuality. The first report was of a girl aged 8 yr., 6 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at 7 yr., 6 mo. Her apparent psychological precocity was a mixture of three ingredients: superior intelligence, extraordinary fluency in speaking, and unusual breadth of interest and knowledge. Romantic fantasies were frequent and elaborate, but did not include imagery of physical eroticism. Overt erotic behavior was not manifested but, even had it been, the girl would not have been appraised as adult, psychologically. The gulf between infancy and adulthood, with regard to learning and accomplishment, is too great for somatic sexual precocity to have allowed of a dramatic short-cut, even though this girl's speed of psychological development was considerable. The girl was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. The second report was of a girl who, at 6 yr., 4 mo., was well advanced into puberty, but not yet menstruating. Among the sixteen children studied, male and female, she had encountered and tried to negotiate the most overtly baffling and difficult life experiences. Difficulties were engendered chiefly by her father, who was psychosexually disturbed and pathologically suspicious to a degree that many would evaluate as psychotic. The girl was retarded in all-round social, educational, and psychological development. She had trance-like spells of inattention. She made monotonous rocking movements in public. In private, she spent long periods during the day, and in bed each night, twisting and writhing her thighs and legs in automatic fashion. She was appraised as severely disturbed psychologically. The third report was of a girl aged 9 yr., 3 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at the age of 7 yr., 4 mo. Her physical precocity made her seem like a lumbering, overgrown schoolgirl and not like a young lady before her time. She was not in the least disconcerted by the disparity in physical appearance between herself and other schoolgirls of her age. Her achievements, interests, and activities were average and typical for girls of her age with whom she mixed. She was prosaic and literal minded. What few romantic fantasies she had were rather pallid. She manifested no overt erotic behavior. She was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. Recommendations for the rearing and psychological management of girls with idiopathic sexual precocity are substantially the same as those presented with the study of precocity in a boy.",

      "abstract": "thoroughout most of a woman's life. The restrictions range from generally held beliefs that menstrual blood is somehow dangerous through a wide vari? ety of limitations on personal behavior, requirements that men and male things be avoided, and, in some cases, physical seclusion in a hut or segregated area. In their long-term and periodic aspect they differ from initiation ceremonies that occur once in a lifetime, although there is considerable overlap in the content of the customs. Moreover, menstrual taboos are not obviously directed toward the enhancement of the individual as are most initia? tion ceremonies. In their degrading aspect they are closer to the customs of social separation and abasement imposed on ethnic groups and low-caste persons, except, of course, that the latter apply at all times. Actually, the periodicity of menstrual taboos, while helpful for a prelimi? nary operational definition, is a secondary problem. It may be that some of the restrictions apply at all times and are simply not reported. It may be also that menstruation is not the only signal for the observance of restrictions on female behavior. At any rate, there is no necessary relationship between the physical facts of menstruation and the taboo customs, as is demonstrated by the widespread nonoccurrence of the latter. Like skin color, the particular stimulus is used to hang the customs on, but another cue might conceivably just as well have been found.",

Such violence particularly affects women, but there are also violence perpetrated against men. This violence can take many forms, but we will only consider here the forensic clinical aspects, emphasizing the relevant legislation and medical ethics.",

The elderly lose much with aging: decline in their senses, health, mobility, and independence. With admission to nursing homes, further loss occurs when the intimacy needs of the resident and their partner are often overlooked and ignored. This omission is resultant of society’s stereotypical and prejudicial thinking of the elderly as asexual or the sexual activity of older persons as perverse. Intimacy and touching are the last pleasurable things an elderly person gives up. The person who is denied touch, affection, or connection with another human being slowly deteriorates and dies physically and emotionally.",

      "abstract": "The use of sex and sexy illustrations in advertising is a subject that has been shunned by writers in fields such as communications, psychology, behavioural sciences, and even in the specific areas of consumer behaviour, marketing, and advertising. Although the current literature on consumer behaviour and advertising considers sex in the Freudian or Maslow sense, its use in advertising has not been explicitly elucidated. This is somewhat surprising when one considers that Freud maintained that sex or libido is the most important of all instincts and that apparent motives for an act often can be found in the sexual drive exerting itself in an unconscious and devious fashion.",

There is no age at which ends the expression of sexuality and intimacy. Through education, quality of life and advances in medicine, the average life expectancy is still increasing. Sexual activity of older people society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases. In women, the most important symptoms of sexual dysfunction are lack of emotional wellbeing and a sense of intimacy during sexual intercourse.",

The exponents of gender power can be found on a number of levels of language and communication: from the grammatical system, through e.g. the linguistic picture of the world, pragmatically conditioned areas, to various discourses of modern culture. The causes of gender power vary; they are associated mostly with historical grounding, as well as conventionalisation of communication forms and behaviour. In some situations e.g. artistic and scientific discourses, media communication the power of gender is weakened in favour of gender fluidity, and then maybe even postgenderism.",

      "title": "Hair pulling (trichotillomania).",
      "abstract": "Based on the findings in this case and common elements reported in other articles on trichotillomania, there seems to be evidence that the \"irresistible urge\" to pull out the hair has its beginnings in the early years of a child's life. The nature of the parent-child relationships appears to be especially important in establishing psychological antecedents for the later development of trichotillomania. Specifically, the trichotillomanic's mother sets the stage for the emergence of this symptom by extending the child's dependence upon her as the primary need-gratifier beyond early childhood into latency, adolescence, and adulthood. As a result the child is not gradually propelled to participate in newer and more complex learning experiences that ultimately lead to a sense of mastery and independent functioning in the environment. Important developmental stimuli are not presented at the appropriate times and the child is not exposed to certain types of interactions at the optimal times so that some very important ego functions do not develop, or develop minimally, or in a distorted manner. Simply, the mother cannot \"let go\" of her child, apparently deriving gratification of her own needs through infantilization of the child; as a result the child develops a limited or illusory sense of self sufficiency. Continuation of such an unhealthy symbiotic relationship, however, is found in many forms of psychopathology and the fact that it also underlies trichotillomania may partially account for hair pulling as a symptom associated with such a wide range of nosological categories. It is the main contention of this study, however, that the quality of the parent-child relationships impairs the ego development and causes failure of the trichotillomanic patient to establish object constancy. Without the establishment of object constancy an individual requires visible evidence that the object/person capable of gratifying basic security needs is present or available. In trichotillomania the hair seems to symbolize the need-gratifying object/person who is lost when the hair is pulled out and, more importantly, regained when it is eaten or restored. It appears to be this latter component of trichotillomania, i.e., reincorporation of the need-gratifying object/person, which reassures the patient that infantile needs can be gratified and security can be reestablished. Unfortunately, the trichotillomanic is driven to repeatedly and compulsively remove hair so that it can be regained temporarily since object constancy is never really established.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundAlthough humans experience orgasms with a degree of statistical regularity, they remain among the most enigmatic of sexual responses; difficult to define and even more difficult to study empirically. The question of whether animals experience orgasms is hampered by similar lack of definition and the additional necessity of making inferences from behavioral responses.MethodHere we define three behavioral criteria, based on dimensions of the subjective experience of human orgasms described by Mah and Binik, to infer orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in other species: 1) physiological criteria that include pelvic floor and anal muscle contractions that stimulate seminal emission and/or ejaculation in the male, or that stimulate uterine and cervical contractions in the female; 2) short-term behavioral changes that reflect immediate awareness of a pleasurable hedonic reward state during copulation; and 3) long-term behavioral changes that depend on the reward state induced by the OLR, including sexual satiety, the strengthening of patterns of sexual arousal and desire in subsequent copulations, and the generation of conditioned place and partner preferences for contextual and partner-related cues associated with the reward state. We then examine whether physiological and behavioral data from observations of male and female rats during copulation, and in sexually-conditioned place- and partner-preference paradigms, are consistent with these criteria.ResultsBoth male and female rats display behavioral patterns consistent with OLRs.ConclusionsThe ability to infer OLRs in rats offers new possibilities to study the phenomenon in neurobiological and molecular detail, and to provide both comparative and translational perspectives that would be useful for both basic and clinical research.",

This sexual arousal is based in an organism's biological imperative to reproduce when under stress. Parallels with lower forms of life—cells, plants, and animals—are presented as demonstrating a unity of evolutionary purpose. Autoerotic asphyxia is looked at as a learned technique of enhancing sexual pleasure through hypoxia to the brain. Anaerobic exercise and the accompanying hypoxia is also presented as capable of inducing sexual arousal. Violence is examined as a sexual stimulus, especially as it occurs in sadomasochistic practices, rape, child molesting, and serial killings. All of these aberrant sexual behaviors are seen as stresses which can produce sexual arousal.",

      "abstract": "Paraphilia is a term used to describe different sexual deviations involving unconventional methods of sexual gratification. Paraphili as indulged in abnormal and orthodox sex play by using objects as parts of the body or fantasies in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. Perversions are acts that are socially prohibited or unacceptable, or biologically undesirable. In sexual paraphilia, usually, person psychopaths suffer from mental aberrations and conflicts, socio-sexual maladjustments, psychosexual imbalance, and abnormalities. Paraphilia-induced suicide is a type of anomic suicide, and anomic suicide is due to a lack of social regulation that occurs during high levels of stress and frustration. Paraphilia may induce suicide even though paraphilia is not punishable. It is just due to fear of social defamation and social taboo. Case presentation: A 59-year-old male committed suicide on the railway track, and thenthe body was sent to the mortuary room for an autopsy examination. History was taken from the police and relatives. He was a widower for the last 15 years. Conclusions: Paraphilia is the form of the insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and when a person cannot remove foreign bodies himself, attending a hospital is very humiliating. To prevent the social integrity or selfesteem, the person committed suicide. Where this type of paraphilia is not listed as a crime in India, for sexual gratification, a person may use it by any means, which may be natural or unnatural form. Many unnatural forms of paraphilia are used by many people, which is not punishable. Sexual gratification is done by most of normal people and a few abnormal psychiatric people by any sexual perversion. All paraphilia that is not punishable by the law should not be considered a social taboo.",

In between is the reproductive phase or adulthood. Life span can be defined as the duration of life of an individual or organism in a particular environment. The life span of a multicellular organism may be broadly divided into three phases: development (growth), reproductive period (adulthood) and senescence (aging). The time of onset, duration and rate of each phase is dependent on the vigour and vitality of the other, and are therefore interrelated. Development normally involves both quantitative and qualitative changes leading to suitable specialization of various cells, tissues and organs of the body, which is usually referred to as differentiation. The development of many animals is divided into prenatal and postnatal periods. For many years, attention was focused on events taking place before birth, when the most striking advances occur in the animals. Prenatal and postnatal stages are characterized by certain distinguishing features, such as morphologic, physiologic, biochemical and psychological features.",

Few areas in biological and social sciences have witnessed a more spectacular growth in past 15 years than play. Play unites and cuts across disciplines leading very directly to questions relating to species adaptation and developmental change. Yet play is also a minefield for unwary, harboring a huge array of conflicting definitions, theories, and perspectives. The essence of play is paradox. This paradox both invites inquiry and repulses scientific systematization. Perhaps most fundamental paradox inherent in play is that its widespread occurrence at higher phylogenetic levels and its large role in behavior of humans suggests its adaptive significance, while playing appears to be purposeless. Or worse, Fagen suggests that the net immediate effect of play on fitness is therefore likely to be negative in most cases (37, p. 397). The importance of play in quantitative terms is overshadowed by its quality. It is residual in sense that it is often recognized and defined by contrast with other behaviors (e.g. play-fighting) and in sense that individuals appear to play only after other, presumably more important, motives (hunger, sex, shelter) have been satisfied. The third and last paradox to be presented does not exhaust list; two most widely accepted theories of play appear to be diametrically opposed. Both have a respectable history.

      "abstract": "Theories on female sexuality are questioned from the point of view of the incertitude surroundig the female sex. Such a sex seems, in fact, to sbvert the limits of representation : instability, and the emergence of anguish as a result of disquieting strangeness, mark the failure of sexual's repression. At the opposite side, we find that representational ability finds its limits in the representation of desire, which seems to tend towards a beyond the text connotation in the protrayal of feminity. Discourses and disciplines dealing with it exclude the notion of sex : in law, the ultimate appeal is delegated to divine will, biology loses the notion of difference in view of the multiple nature of sexual determining factors, and the social medicine field maneuvers gender intentities in their procreation sense. As for feminine identity resulting from theories of female sexuality, its underlying psychomorphism creates a basis for it by subtracting it from its male root (penisneid) when it is not to be found in a thinking that further stresses the formal logic of the argument (other-enjoyment) rather the body. The body - or sexual - which the dream is able to see is shapeless : it is the capacity for metaphors, therefore emergence of names (ex. Trimethylamine). The narcissistic regression of the dream is protected by the cover of sleep and the forgetfulness of dreams ; in waking life the censorship which envelops subjectivity and which limits libidinal investments finds support in the name (when it is able to provide a name) in place of the body which has been mislaid into/for language. The freud's moses and moses' names would be this theory of names : a memory that is transmitted as much as, its traces lots, it is still open to the game of deformations (entstellung), in the same way the remainders of the oedipus complex that haven't been stranslated slide along the symbolic equation.",

Disorders of desire might be considered in relation to insecure patterns of attachment, where mentalizing, or the capacity to adopt a \"third position\", is likely to be limited or absent. Sexual desire manifests itself in the form of a serpent, the uncoiling penis, and the prospect of coitus. While sexual \"knowledge\", either in the form of information or experience, is less hard to come by these days than in former times, the affective component of desire can remain an enigma. Attachment theory has in common with Freudian psychoanalytic theory some acknowledgement of the place of biology in the dynamics of desire, but gives emphasis to the significance of relationships in shaping and channelling its expression.",

      "abstract": "This study is on the image of a woman's body exposure, expressed in various situations or images in the modern fashion. The results of this study can be summarized as the following. First, either the exposure or stress of a woman's specific body parts like breast, waist, hips, or legs which can be sensed totally different from man's or the ironic disclosure of body parts always lapped around emphasizes femininity by giving full play the unique sexual beauty of a woman's body. Second, the desire of disclosure to have others' attention with the concealment as suggestive exposure expresses the eroticism. The modified eroticism is found different from the conventional concept and is based on the desire to make others notice one's existence continually by the sexual exposure dress particularly to entire the other sex, the dismantlement of changing an underwear to an outer-dress, and so forth. Third, both exposure of a woman's sexual body parts and expression of exposure to the utmost by laying a woman's entire body bare can mean sex liberty in the laissez-faire generation. This may suggest a pleasure-oriented way of thinking of the self-consolation rather than showing others, or feature the personality and the liberty endowed women with.",

What is regarded as normal sexual intercourse and what is thought to be impaired or unsatisfactory, depends in part on the expectations of the two individuals concerned. For example one couple may regard it as normal that the woman is regularly unable to achieve orgasm, whilst another may seek treatment. The problems of sexual dysfunction include those affecting sexual desire and sexual enjoyment, erectile impotence and premature ejaculation.",

The subject was identified as a male at birth, and reared as such in a society in which the differentiation between male and female social roles is more incisive than is generally the case in modern Western society. The appearance at adolescence of gender-incongruent physical secondary sex characteristics, and the comprehensive physical and psychological examinations that were subsequently performed, showed ‘him’ to be essentially feminine, however. Hence, after minor genital surgery, the subject was re-registered as a female and retested 16 months after her reassignment of sex. The subject showed marked improvement in the pattern of serious intrapsychic maladjustment evinced on initial testing, but a deterioration in social behaviour. These findings indicate that differences in psychosexual orientation and behaviour have a biological basis, and are not wholly learned and/or imprinted.",

Debido a la limitacion consecuente de la lesion, el portador de lesion medular enfrenta cambios significativos en su vida sexual. Ese estudio objetiva describir las alteraciones evidenciadas y las dificultades enfrentadas por el lesionado medular en la relacion sexual. Participaron de la investigacion diez personas portadoras de paraplejia y tetraplejia hay por lo menos seis meses, de ambos sexos. Para colecta de los datos, realizamos una entrevista estructurada. Los hallazgos apuntan que las alteraciones causadas en la funcion sexual dependen del nivel y del grado de la lesion medular. Fueron observadas alteraciones en la sensibilidad, reduccion en la misma; en la ereccion, dificultad en hacerla o mantenerla; en la evaluacion, que puede estar impedida o hacerse retrograda; en la fertilizacion, reduccion del numero de espermas; en la lubricacion, que puede estar disminuida; entre otros. La movilidad alterada es uno de los factores que mas perjudica el portador de lesion medular en el desempeno del acto sexual. Se concluye que la satisfaccion de los antojos sexuales es un factor que proporciona estado de bienestar, con eso es importante que la pareja recoja descubrir diferentes formas de satisfacer esos antojos. La implicacion y la comprension del companero son extremadamente importantes en todo el transcurrir de la conquista de la satisfaccion sexual.",

      "abstract": "The nature of sexual activity presents two severe problems for those who desire impersonal one-night-stands. In the first place, except for masturbation, sex necessitates collective action; and all collective action requires communication. Mutually understood signals must be conveyed, intentions expressed, and the action sustained by reciprocal encouragement. A second problem arises from the cultural conditioning of Western man. Both the appeal and the danger of ephemeral sex are increased because the partners are usually strangers to one another. In the positioning and signaling phases of the game, the players have already indicated their intentions. This stage, then, merely formalizes the agreement and sets the terms of the payoff. Another type of action that tends to swell the volume of sexual acts in a given facility is the simultaneous encounter, in which more than one sexual act is in process at the same time.",

The focus of psychosexual medicine and sex therapy in this area has tended to be on the genitals, which are also popularly regarded as the main erogenous zones. However, many parts of the body can be sexually exciting when stimulated, with diversity across people and cultures as to which zones are experienced as erogenous. This suggests a psychosocial, as well as physiological, element to such experiences. Recent work on fantasy, erotica, and tantric sex also suggests that it is worth taking seriously the cliché that the brain is the main erogenous zone.",

Across many different studies and measures, men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women, as reflected in spontaneous thoughts about sex, frequency and variety of sexual fantasies, desired frequency of intercourse, desired number of partners, masturbation, liking for various sexual practices, willingness to forego sex, initiating versus refusing sex, making sacrifices for sex, and other measures. No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) were found. Hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive. The gender difference in sex drive should not be generalized to other constructs such as sexual or orgasmic capacity, enjoyment of sex, or extrinsically motivated sex.",

Indeed, voyeurism may be the most common, potentially law‐breaking, sexual behavior. Other data suggest exhibitionism is the most widespread sexual offense. Voyeurism centers on nonconsensual observation of the sexual activity of others, while exhibitionism pivots on the illicit exposure of genitalia to an unwilling audience. Both voyeurism and exhibition are thus considered hands‐off sexual behaviors, as neither requires physical contact with a victim, unlike rape, which requires penetration.",

Viewed and perceived as new socio-cultural constructions within the basic structure (community matrix), both inter-dependently and dependent on the majority, this minority acquires (or will be assigned!) new directions of evolution/involution, far away from the general pattern, in time stalking or even posturing a new identity and consciousness. Charged or fined by the majority community, sometimes tolerated, sometimes categorically rejected. There are many cases, both old and new, of such segmentations, enclavings or exclusions with an economic, cultural or racial nature, generated by the imagination and/or authoritarianism of the majority: homo sapiens will use slowly but surely and irreversibly the tyranny of the majority and progress on less advanced technological-cognitive relatives, neanderthals and denisovans (plus several other subspecies of hominids, contemporary with homo sapiens); over the time, Christians will anathematize, enclave and/or kill the Jews for improbable deeds or on the basis of arrogant ethical/moral superiorities; the ancient or feudal masters disposed of the lives and possessions of the slaves they had, as they pleased; those who did not conform to official dogmas became instantly heretics and liable to all sorts of punishments (see the actions and justifications of the Inquisition); the prejudices regarding skin color, sexual orientation, ethnic or political affiliation, sometimes aggressively (apartheid in South Africa or racial segregation in the US) have determined certain defensive behaviors of these minorities, marginalized or excluded. Examples can easily be multiplied (talking about minors, the marginalized or excluded ones culturally, economically, racially, medically etc. for almost every country), but this is not the desideratum of the present study. Functionally and adaptively, the norms of a traditional community such as the Romanian one, repeatedly violated and corroborated with the refusal of alterity, led to a cultural-negative perception and to the location outside of the limits set by the community of such socio-cultural categories. Such marginals (called gueux in France, rogue in England, abenteurer in Germany, or picaras in Spain) are often mentioned at the level of fantastic Romanian fairy tale even if the details are meteoric or extremely lapidary. As the fantastic Romanian fairy tale illustrates, it is established and legitimated first of all the ideal of purity, beauty and superiority (social, economic, moral); still there are mentions of the problematical interethnic relations, cultural conflicts, failures of social adaptation to the generally accepted system; finally, as we do not have such a study about these social categories, I find it appropriate to approach this topic. My approach will be a structural-functional one, dialectically speaking, most of the mentions about these social categories being found in the anthologies of fairy tales, juxtaposing, overlapping or complementing the three categories (marginal, minority, excluded) conceptually.",

These latter organs of infinitely diversified kinds graduate into, and in some cases can hardly be distinguished from, those which are commonly ranked as primary, such as the complex appendages at the apex of the abdomen in male insects.

Social and cultural influences on sexual behaviour are in a continuous process of change.This article attempts to highlight the importance of a multifaceted systemic approach to a common and distressing problem.The aetiology of sexual dysfunction is diverse and usually results from a complex interaction of biological, psychological and social factors. Consequently, there is little to be gained from trying to determine whether a disorder is either biological or psychological, as both will be relevant to a certain extent in every case. Even in a case with a clear biological cause (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) the treatment and long term consequences of the secondary sexual disorder will be affected by psychosocial implications.

Much remains to be learned about both the somatic and the psychological aspects. Research and reliable reporting about spinal-cord-injured women has been scant. It is important to keep in mind that there is great variation from one individual to another and, even in the same individual, from one time to another.

Cet article se penche sur les pratiques des femmes transcapacitaires et les réactions négatives qu’elles suscitent, fondées sur des structures capacitistes, sexistes, hétéronormatives et classistes. À partir d’une approche intersectionnelle, nous soutenons que les catégories de sexe/genre, de sexualité et de classes se fondent sur un capacitisme, car leur construction est liée à certains codes (manière de bouger, de parler, etc.) présupposant des corps non handicapés. Sous cet angle, il est possible de penser que les réalités transcapacitaires suscitent des résistances puisqu’elles mettent au défi les normes capacitistes, mais également parce que ces transformations représentent une transgression des normes de sexe/genre, de sexualité et de classes dominantes. En se positionnant dans une situation de handicap, les femmes transcapacitaires et leurs pratiques « extrêmes » risquent davantage d’être dégenrées, désexualisées et marginalisées économiquement et socialement. Ces critiques des systèmes d’oppression sont l’occasion de (re)penser les solidarités entre les études et les mouvements féministes, queers , anticapacitistes et anticlassistes, tout en formulant une réponse respectueuse envers les revendications transcapacitaires.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses the physical and cognitive changes characteristic of pubertal maturation. Just prior to puberty, the sensitivity of the gonadostat to the negative feedback of gonadal sex steroids decreases, releasing the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) from inhibition. Puberty is heralded by the myriad of physical changes that occur in the body with the advent of the hormonally mediated effects and the cognitive shift associated with them. With both the psychological and biological maturity of adolescence come issues of separation and individuation, consolidation of a sense of self, development of a sexual identity and progress toward academic and vocational plans for adult life. The most useful framework for the discussion is the biopsychosocial model, which has also been used successfully in so many other domains. Throughout adolescence, the work of development that was made possible by the physical, cognitive and psychological changes induced by puberty continues unabated.",

      "title": "Hormetic sexuality and eroticism promote healthy ageing",
      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this chapter I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that, health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation, it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one's partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one's sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

Most, however, pass quickly through this phase and although, like most adults, they may continue to swear they do so mainly to relieve feelings of tension and frustration and only then in situations where such language is uncensured and inoffensive to those present. There is, indeed, a developmental pattern to the swear words that children use. Between the ages of around four to seven years children tend to use words associated with excrement (even indirectly in some cases; e.g., knickers). Often the delight in using them stems not only from the knowledge that they are forbidden, but also from a fairly precise knowledge of their meaning. The next stage is the use of sexual obscenities and the delight in using these stems from their reference to forbidden things or their power to affect or provoke adults, rather than from an awareness of their precise meaning. Finally, older children may use blasphemies widely and openly; e.g. Jesus Christ! There is much disagreement among adults as regards the use and nature of such blasphemies and a whole area of uncertainty surrounds them. When using these words older children are often testing out their positions vis-à-vis adults within an area of perceived controversy, but it frequently represents a growing awareness of what is or is not acceptable.",

      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

Sex differences can result from differential postnatal experiences (interaction with parents, environment) or from biological factors (hormones and genes) acting pre- or postnatally. The first option is often favored to explain sexual orientation although it is supported by little experimental evidence. In contrast, many sexually differentiated behaviors are organized during early life by an irreversible action of sex steroids. In particular, the preference for a male or female sex partner is largely determined in rodents by embryonic exposure to sex steroids. The early action of these steroids also seems to affect sexual orientation in humans. Indeed, clinical conditions associated with major endocrine changes during embryonic life often result in an increased incidence of homosexuality. Furthermore, multiple sexually differentiated behavioral, physiological, or even morphological traits that are kn...",

Or a man may enjoy sex more when his partner wears lacy panties because he finds it particularly titillating. Are these normal or deviant practices?",

Although the phrase language deprivation syndrome may be new, the observation, that deficits observed in some deaf people's life skills might be due not to sensory deprivation or to social impoverishment, but specifically to deprivation, is not. Language deprivation is often the unintended outcome of well-intentioned efforts to promote a child's development. The existence of deprivation is a corollary to the existence of a critical period for learning one's first language. The most severe cases of deprivation therefore follow a child's not being exposed to consistent and fully elaborated during the entire critical period, approximately the first five years of life. Language deprivation persists in large part because it crosses the boundaries of multiple professional disciplines, none of which is solely responsible for a child's outcome.",

School´s harassment or bullying is the physical or psychological deliberate and constant mistreatment that a child receives on the part of other one or others, which behave with him cruelly with the aim to submit it and to scare it. It implies a continued\nrepetition of the jeers or the aggressions and can provoke the social exclusion of the victim.

Most existing etiological models describe sexual offending behavior as a variant of offending behavior and mostly include factors referring to disinhibition and sexual deviance. In this article, we argue that there is additional value in describing sexual offending behavior as sexual behavior in terms of an incentive model of sexual motivation. The model describes sexual arousal as an emotion, triggered by a competent stimulus signaling potential reward, and comparable to other emotions coupled with strong bodily reactions. Consequently, we describe sexual offending behavior in terms of this new model with emphasis on the development of deviant sexual interests and preferences. Summarized, the model states that because sexual arousal itself is an emotion, there is a bidirectional relationship between sexual self-regulation and emotional self-regulation. Not only can sex be used to regulate emotional states (i.e., sexual coping), emotions can also be used, consciously or automatically, to regulate sexual arousal (i.e., sexual deviance). Preliminary support for the model is drawn from studies in the field of sex offender research as well as sexology and motivation research.",

The chapter begins with a discussion of some of the assumptions and definitions that underlie the material on sexual dysfunctions. The dichotomy, organic versus psychogenic, is often proposed to separate sexual disorders into distinct categories. Dysfunction in its most general sense refers to interference with the typical, desired, or biological role of some phenomena. The definition of sexual dysfunction must include a recognition than problems can exist in one or more aspects of sexual behavior. An interactional model insists that influences upon sexuality cannot be compartmentalized into independent factors.",

Male sex determination is synonymous with testis determination. This process (alternatively called primary sex differentiation) results from a coordinated series of exquisitely regulated, but as yet incompletely understood, events. As generally used, the term \"sex differentiation,\" refers to the processes downstream of gonadal development—the processes that are regulated by gonadal secretions or lack thereof (also called secondary sex differentiation). In essence, the sex chromosome complement endowed at fertilization determines gonad type and the latter determines the pattern of differentiation seen in the genital ducts and external genitalia.",

      "abstract": "The sexual attraction is a complex emotional event, with somatic modifications, that like all the emotions, belongs to the psychic dimension and that, too much simply, can be led back, from a explicative point of view, to biological and psychical causes. The sexual attraction represents a personal experience, that is difficult to record, but of which every adult is able to delineate a correspondence with own âlivedâ. In the within of biological sciences, many experimental studies were been conducted with the aim to know which chemistries substances and cerebral zones are involved in front of a stimulus assessed like sexually attractive. \r\nContrarily, there are little researches conducted in psychological field, aimed to the understanding the psychical factors, often unconscious, tinged to the subjective processes of sexual attraction: the sexual attraction remains an unexplored psychological event and unprovided of adapted instruments of assessment.\r\nThe present thesis is oriented in primis to examine the existing scientific literature, in order to provide an exhaustive picture of the sexual attraction and to analyze the instruments of survey available for the empirical assessment of it.\r\nSecondly, the thesis is oriented to introduce two studies: the first study is aimed to adapt the Cuestionario de AtracciA³n Sexual - CAS (FernAindez ET to, 2006a; 2006b; 2006c) to the Italian language; the second study is aimed to assess the attitudes towards the sexual attraction in a sample of university students, in order to establish if some differences or association with some psychological dimensions (attachment stiles and alexithymia) exist.",

      "abstract": "Some previous work on arthropod development is insufficiently detailed or incompletely reported.Much of the published information in this area is of limited use for the general analysis of life cycles.These difficulties arise primarily because many experiments do not control fully for the strain of the material (and even its specific identity) nor for rearing conditions, do not ade quately take account of the complexity of life cycles and their stages, or are restricted to only part of the life cycle.For example, 285 such factors as variable numbers of instars, sexual differences, abbreviated or hidden stages and dormancies may mean that the \"average durations\" reported apply to an unknown mixture of developmental types.Nor are experiments always designed or results reported and analysed in a logical and transparent manner.Undefined terms may obscure what actual developmental intervals were measured.Highly derived developmental or demographic measures may obscure core data.Statistical information may be inade quate.Such pitfalls are reviewed here, suggesting ways to ensure that results on the duration of development are both valid for spe cific studies and more widely useful.General experimental difficulties, recommended background information that should be provided, recommended life-cycle intervals and their terminology, and recommended ways to report numerical and statistical infor mation are briefly summarized in tabular form.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is often defined to include sexual behavior, the development of sexual preferences, the understanding of the self as a sexual being, sexual decision-making, and agency (Vasilenko, Lefkowitz, & Welsh, 2014). It also incorporates the understanding of others' sexual desires, and how to approach and manage intimacy with another person. Although sexual development and sexuality are founded in biology (Harden, 2014; Rodgers & Rowe, 1993), they also evolve from new life experiences that become more prevalent in adolescence, including the tendency to form close, dyadic relationships with peers of the same and other sex, and increased autonomy to spend more time with peers without the presence or supervision of parents or other adults (Impett & Tolman, 2006; Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2004; Zimmer-Gembeck, Ducat, & Collins, 2011; Zimmer-Gembeck, 2002). Thus, it is not surprising that all aspects of sexuality develop rapidly, expand with sexual expression and depth of experience during adolescence (and early adulthood), and become highly salient features of adolescents' and early adults' daily lives.",

      "title": "Resilience",
      "abstract": "Resilience is the capacity to maintain stable levels of functioning, as well as positive emotions and generative experiences, following or under conditions of significant adversity. Resilience researchers have largely focused on two broad types of adversity: (1) acute and time-limited events that are outside the range of ordinary experience, such as physical or sexual assault, traumatic injury, disease, natural disaster, mass casualty events, war, and interpersonal loss; and (2) chronic enduring stressors, usually experienced in childhood, such as neglect, socioeconomic disadvantage, oppressive political conditions, and physical or mental abuse. Although these two types of adversity necessarily entail different methods and theoretical frameworks, research findings from both literatures have converged on a common conclusion: resilience is common, even under the most extreme adversity. The empirical study of psychological resilience as such is a relatively recent phenomenon—until about thirty-five years ago it drew almost no serious scientific attention. Recently, however, the resilience literature has burgeoned at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately, the study of resilience has been plagued by definitional controversies and methodologically uninformative research. One important cleavage concerns the way resilience is defined and measured. A substantial body of research defines resilience as a personality construct; another literature insists that resilience is defined as an outcome (or process) in response to the experience of significant adversity. Although both approaches have produced relevant and informative research, it is worth noting that, in sheer volume, most resilience research is now devoted to the personality-as-resilience approach. Because these studies often do not study reactions to a marker event, rely exclusively on self-report scales, and employ cross-sectional designs, they are usually (but not always) of inferior methodological quality. Consistent with the suggestions of a number of scholars, this latter approach is described here as “resiliency,” not resilience. Although this bibliography includes high-quality studies that define resilience as a personality construct, most of the research and scholarship listed here operationally defines resilience as an outcome or process that unfolds following acute adversity or during chronic forms of adversity.",

Se han utilizado como instrumentos de recojo de información fichas, y como técnicas la observación, el análisis, y la síntesis, el método seleccionado fue el deductivo. Se revisaron 15 investigaciones realizadas en diversos países referidas a la sexualidad del adulto mayor. Resultados: Se han encontrado algunas descripciones sobre actitudes sexuales, en diversos pueblos con anterioridad al año 100 Antes de Cristo, y recién en el siglo XX se empieza a investigar la sexualidad desde el punto de vista científico, con los aportes de Balzac, Jung (1969) y Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Existen factores y mitos que afectan y están relacionados con la sexualidad del adulto mayor. La existencia de un declive gradual con la edad, en la actividad e interés sexual, en el caso de los varones se produce a partir de los 60 años, la actividad sexual más frecuente son las caricias y tocamientos, seguidas del coito, también se observa una mayor actividad sexual en las mujeres mayores que han tenido intensa actividad sexual en la juventud. Un alto número (74% hombres, 42% mujeres) practican la masturbación, la relevancia del sexo decae a partir de los 56 años de edad, llegando a considerarse como nada o poco importante en el 57% de las personas mayores de 65 años. Conclusiones: La sexualidad incluye todas las formas de expresión, desde la aproximación, el tacto, la intimidad emocional, la compañía, la masturbación y no solamente el coito. Es un aspecto importante que en la vejez debe continuar siendo una fuente de placer y no una fuente de inquietud y frustración.",

Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

However, in considering child abuse and neglect as examples of adverse life events that have the potential to affect development and subsequent psychopathology, the assumption of “well-being” in the child’s life prior to the victimization experience may not be a reasonable one. Although certain forms of childhood victimization may indeed be viewed as acute stressors, child abuse and neglect often occur against a background of more chronic adversity in multiproblem homes. Child abuse or neglect may be only one of a family’s problems. Thus the general effects of other family characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment, parental alcoholism or drug problems, or other inadequate social and family functioning, must be recognized and disentangled from the specific effects of childhood abuse or neglect.",

      "title": "Brain Effects of Environmental Enrichment and Deprivation",
      "abstract": "The role of experience in brain organization and function can be studied by systematically manipulating developmental experiences. The most common protocols use extremes in experiential manipulation, such as environmental deprivation and/or enrichment. Studies of the effects of deprivation range from laboratory studies in which animals are raised in the absence of sensory or social experiences from infancy to children raised in orphanages with limited caregiver interaction. In both cases there are chronic perceptual, cognitive, and social dsyfunctions that are associated with chronic changes in neuronal structure and connectivity. Deprivation can be more subtle too, such as being raised in a low socioeconomic environment, which is often associated with poverty. Such experience is especially detrimental to language development, which in turn, limits educational opportunities. Unfortunately, the effects of some forms of socioemotional deprivation are often difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate. In contrast, adding sensory or social experiences can enhance behavioral functions. For example, placing animals in environments that are cognitively, motorically, and/or socially more complex than standard laboratory housing is associated with neuronal changes that are correlated with superior functions. Enhanced sensory experiences can be relatively subtle, however. For example, tactile stimulation with a soft brush for 15 minutes, three times daily for just two weeks in infant rats leads to permanent improvement in a wide range of psychological functions, including motoric, mnemonic, and other cognitive functions. Both complex environments and sensory stimulation can also reverse the negative effects of many other experiences. Thus, tactile stimulation accelerates discharge from hospital for premature human infants and stimulates recovery from stroke in both infant and adult rats. In sum, brain and behavioral functions are exquisitely influenced by manipulation of sensory experiences, especially in development.",

      "abstract": "An extensive series of papers by Brody and co-workers using questionnaires have correlated penile vaginal intercourse (PVI) and clitoral stimulation with various female functions and malfunctions. A major claim is that only PVI ‘competently performed and sensitively experienced’ leading to orgasm is ‘associated with, and in some cases, causes processes associated with better psychological and physical functioning’. Clitoral stimulation to orgasm per se or to facilitate orgasm even during PVI, however, is not beneficial to women’s, psychological, interpersonal or behavioural health and can lead to ‘noxious consequences’. Recently, as correlations are no guarantee of causation, independent studies have not confirmed some of their claims. The present review examines critically and rejects :- the demonising of the clitoris as an organ inducing ‘deadly pleasures’ or that it should become vestigial by self-creating a ‘psychological clitoridectomy’, that evolution ‘rewards’ PVI but punishes clitoral stimulation, that cervical buffeting is normally involved in PVI-orgasms or that a longer penis facilitates these, that orgasm is involved in sperm transport and thus reproductive fitness, that prolactin released at orgasm is an instigator of sexual satiation, that the coital alignment technique does not involve clitoral and periurethral glans stimulation by the penis and that women who cannot have orgasms induced by PVI alone are sexually dysfunctional and that their male partners are sexually inadequate.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The model of sexuality currently in force is a young, genitalized model, that does not tolerate failures and often forgets about affective communication, sharing and body contact. This model is also not compatible with the natural aging process, generating manymyths about sexuality in later life. Although a taboo subject, the majority (up to 70%) of healthy 70-year-olds revealedthemselves to be sexually active even with some sexual dysfunction reports. Low sexual desire (up to 43%) was the most prevalent reported sexual difficulty in women, and erectiledifficulties (up to 37%) were most prevalent among men. Aging impacts sexuality in various ways: age-related organic/metabolic changes in men and women; age-related affective and cognitive changes also in both genders; age-and duration-related changes in a couple’s dynamic interaction, which can lead to discrepancy between the partners and their sexual narratives. In the sexual response cycle, aging affects the stages of desire, arousal/excitement,plateau, orgasm, and resolution/refractory period both men and women. Depressed mood as well as the use of antidepressant drugs, deterioration of cognitive function and difficulties to communicate can cause loss of intimacy and emotional closeness which then may result in sexual withdrawal and difficulties. Repetitive experiences of failure increase even more the couple distress. There are also to consider medical conditions, medication side effects, loss of physical capacity, subjective loss of attractiveness, lack of a partner, institutionalization or living withtheir children, which can be obstacles to sexual activity in the elderly. Diagnostic workup has to integrate not only general medical, gynecological, urological andpsychiatric factors, but also take a systemic perspective which deals with the interaction pattern of the partners. Treatment of sexual dysfunctions in later life combines biomedical interventions with psychotherapeutic and psychosocial strategies. An essential therapeutic contribution for allcouples is, however, basic counseling and psychoeducation. Explaining how aging has an impact and how other individuals and couples experience these changes is an important step in empowering the couple, clarifying and correcting the sociocultural myths andencouraging the couple to build their very own sexuality.",

      "abstract": "My experience with borderline patients spans 23 years and five continents, and includes some 500 borderlines I have treated, supervised, followed up, known in an administrative capacity on an inpatient unit, or seen in consultation. The habitual self–mutilators I have seen have been predominantly females between the ages of 15 and 40. In the majority, constitutional and environmental factors have interacted in such a way as not to lend support to an either/or interpretation regarding etiology. Where only one causative factor seems to be operative, it has more often been the environmental. In the latter instance, the family environment has generally been far worse than \"unfavorable\": abuse, physical or sexual (or both), has been the order of the day–often in ways that merit characterization as \"grotesque\" or \"inhuman\" (Grunebaum & Klerman. 1967). The timing of the self–mutilative acts coincides with the paramenstrual (i.e. just before or just during) part of the cycle in many instances, but there appear to be equally many instances where the immediate precipitating factor occurred randomly in relation to the menses and took the form of an abrupt loss (rejection in a love relationship; therapists' vacation, etc.).",

      "title": "Stress and Coping in Sexual and Gender Minority Relationships",
      "abstract": "LGBTQ+ is an inclusive term used to encompass sexual and gender minority individuals in aspects of their diversity related to sexual and gender expression. Specifically, LGBTQ+ refers to individuals who may identify as lesbian (L), gay (G), bisexual (B), transgender (T), queer (Q), or other sexual and/or gender identities (+). Given that many individuals live in heteronormative and cisnormative societies, the LGBTQ+ community experiences unique stressors specific to their traditionally marginalized identity/identities; such experiences are defined as experiences of <italic>minority stress</italic>. Aspects of minority stress, including stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, generate stressful social environments for LGBTQ+ individuals and these experiences are often negatively associated with individual and relationship well-being. For example, if an individual experiences harassment for their sexual and/or gender identity, they may experience feelings of distress and be more reserved with public displays of affection with their partner. As such, one romantic partner’s experience of minority stress can impact both they and their partner’s experiences. Relationship maintenance behaviors, such as communicating and coping with the stress together with one’s partner (dyadic coping), have been identified that may help mitigate minority stress’ deleterious effects. Dyadic coping is a process that conceptualizes how partners cope with stress in the context of their relationship, identifying how partners communicate their stress and the respective coping behaviors. Finally, there has been an insurgence of relationship education programs designed to help LGBTQ+ couples identify and cope with experiences of minority stress. For example, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training–Sexual Minority Stress incorporates the unique experiences of sexual minority couples to help couples improve (minority) stress management; enhance their ability to cope as a couple; sensitize both partners to ideas of mutual fairness, equity, and respect; improve communication; and improve (emotional) problem-solving skills.",

      "abstract": "Given that the prevailing literature largely neglects the unwanted sexual activity experiences of men, this study examined both prevalence and predictors of men's compliance with unwanted, but consensual, sexual activity. Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

A Critical Examination of the Literature An extensive series of papers by Brody and co-workers using questionnaires have correlated penile vaginal intercourse (PVI) and clitoral stimulation with various female functions and malfunctions. A major claim is that only PVI ‘competently performed and sensitively experienced’ leading to orgasm is ‘associated with, and in some cases, causes processes associated with better psychological and physical functioning’. Clitoral stimulation to orgasm per se or to facilitate orgasm even during PVI, however, is not beneficial to women’s, psychological, interpersonal or behavioural health and can lead to ‘noxious consequences’.

However, from a review of the cases of 53 male self-mutilators, it appears that a significant number involve individuals not psychotic at the time of the act but rather having character disorders and rageful feelings toward themselves or women, and transsexual males who premeditate their own gender conversion surgery. The psychiatric consultant's role in the management of such an individual in the general hospital setting includes not only care of a patient with a psychotic or impulse disorder but also involves support of the house staff, who are distressed by the fear, guilt, hopelessness, anger, and revulsion that the patient's act of genital self-mutilation causes.",

Some of this work derives from a specifically systemic theoretical and therapeutic framework (e.g. Goldner et al. 1990), but much of it has been either atheoretical or eclectic in psychological terms (e.g. Segal 1990) or has had strong psychoanalytic underpinnings (e.g. Benjamin 1988; Jukes 1993). Indeed, even within some of the systemic literature, as in the Goldner et al. paper referenced above, there is recourse to psychoanalytic thinking to fill in the details of the internal 'mental state' or heritage of the individual protagonists in the gender-rigid or violence-saturated system.",

      "abstract": "Constantly shifting cultural views influence public perceptions of psychiatric diagnoses, sometimes accommodated by changes in diagnostic terminology. Evolving scientific knowledge of the era is at times used to justify and support mental illnesses. Too often, however, remasked nomenclatures fail to alter social stigma, in part because political arguments are used. Scientific validations of variant behaviors as symptoms with a pathologic status are unfortunately overshadowed. Examples of cultural bias effects on recurring diagnostic challenges illustrate a need for scientific validation. Renaming fails to improve stigma or diagnostic clarity. For example, neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion, was attributed to fast-paced urban life through the late 1970s. Its symptoms are now largely, to no real advantage, retitled as chronic fatigue syndrome. Diagnoses like \"hysteria\" have evolved into histrionic personality disorder and somatoform spectrum disorders, although less as a result of demonic possession or a \"wandering uterus.\" Decriminalized and depathologized homosexuality remains a political football, where religious \"sin\" conceptualizations have not been displaced by studies documenting healthy adjustments among groups with diverse sexual orientations and preferences. Each of these remains severely socially stigmatized. The pseudoscience of \"drapetomania,\" once used to rationalize and pathologize a slave's freedom, is perceived now as psychiatric incarcerations of mentally healthy individuals, more commonly in totalitarian regimes-a politicization of stigma. Research reviews and funding efforts need to emphasize a sound basis for individuals caught in perpetuated diagnostic challenges, not remedied by simple shifts in nomenclature.",

It requires a complex series of hormonal changes initiated by alterations in hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms that are incompletely understood, culminating in gonadal sex steroid secretion and associated maturation. While genetics play a major role in the timing and progression of pubertal maturation, other inputs such as nutrition, environmental factors, and social milieu yield individualized variations in the maturational pattern. It is likely that these factors are in part responsible for changes in timing and tempo of pubertal maturation noted over the last few decades. When a child begins to mature at the earliest or latest extremes of the normal ranges, the clinician must determine if the child is undergoing normal puberty, a non-pathologic variation, or a medically concerning condition that requires further investigation or treatment.",

Although menopausal symptoms are primarily considered to be a result of the sometimes intense hormonal fluctuations that are experienced during perimenopause, this does not necessarily exclude the role of psychosocial factors such as demographic characteristics, cultural or ethnic background, attitudes toward menopause, specific lifestyles and habits, specific previous life experiences and personality traits. A review of recent research findings and contributions of these psychosocial factors in the development of perimenopausal symptoms engaged will be presented in this work. Studies have clearly shown that certain psychosocial factors contribute to the occurrence and severity of symptoms or increased risk for perimenopausal symptoms, including the risk for major disturbances, such as clinical depression.",

The relational void in giving up the mother as love object may lead to an internal self-representation of a \"hole\" to be filled, much as the mouth sucks the pacifier in the absence of the nipple. This image may then be extended to the genital representation. In turning to the father, a girl may find that she lacks a relationship with him in the relational space opened up by the loss of the mother; the penis is symbolically withheld from her in the father's relational distance. This lack of sexual and relational gratification, it is proposed, may be schematized by a female as her body being empty of something. The father's absence--the absence of the paternal penis--may lead to an absence of the mental representation of the vagina and to an inhibition of the role the vagina then plays for a woman in sexual desire. Vaginal repression may serve to disguise object hunger that might otherwise be experienced as vaginal longing. An abbreviated clinical vignette, revolving around a masturbatory fantasy, is offered in partial illustration of the thesis.",

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

Schiller's designation of the \"happy infant\" is at least applicable to the healthy, well-cared-for child. There are painful emotions of many kinds—of which we shall speak later on—but these are no more than the shorter interludes of a chronic state of well-being and delight. The instinctive character of the expressional movements calls our attention to still deeper connections between feelings of pleasure and displeasure on the one hand and the child's instinctive life on the other. The psychoanalysts look upon these instances of organic pleasure and the child's actions connected with them as a proof of the existence of infantile sexuality, and speak of sucking ecstasy, \"infantile-onanie\", etc.",

In this area, also, scientific ideology militated against scientists even admitting that invasive animal use raised a moral issue. “Animal use in research is not a moral issue, it is a scientific necessity,” went a common dictum popular from the 1960s through the 1980s. With scientific ideology proscribing talk of subjective states in animals, common-sense acknowledgment of pain and other noxious states in animals was ruled out by fiat and was thus invisible, even to veterinary scientists. Ironically, ignoring pain and other mental states in animals led to bad science, as scientists disregarded the degree to which physiological, metabolic, reproductive, and immunological states in animals were affected by uncontrolled pain and distress, which had major physiological implications.",

Qualitative interview data with Lithuanians 6 months or more into their divorce processes suggest that divorcees experience marital dissolution as an interchange of three main processes: losing valued self-parts, a (re)birth of a more valued self, and hanging-self as being stuck in ongoing uncertainty with a need to protect valued parts of oneself. The theoretical and practical implications of these research findings are discussed.",

      "title": "Barriers to Moderate Physical Activity in Adult Lesbians",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT Adult lesbians are not sufficiently physically active to achieve physical and psychological health benefits. Lesbians are one of the least understood minority groups. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use an ecological framework to identify factors internal to individuals and present in their social environments that may impede participation in regular physical activity. Twenty-one self-identified lesbians aged 22 to 61 years participated in one of four focus groups. The lesbian participants reported many general barriers (i.e., obstacles to participation regardless of sexual orientation) similar to previous research with other populations of women, not stratified by sexual orientation, such as being too tired and the lack of a physical activity partner. A number of lesbian-specific barriers (i.e., obstacles unique to being a lesbian) were also identified, such as the lack of lesbian-focused physical activity groups and the lack of same-sex family memberships to fitness facilities. In conclusion, for many of the general barriers, some of the proven and effective traditional intervention strategies are likely to be effective in increasing physical activity participation rates in the lesbian population. However, barriers related to sexual orientation are likely deeply entrenched in the socio-cultural system of American society and require a societal rethinking of attitudes towards lesbians, a cultural change that is not as easily amenable to traditional health promotion interventions.

      "title": "Theories of sexual identity and the masculinization of the gay man",
      "abstract": "Since the early 1970s the style and image of gay men in North America and Western Europe has undergone a dramatic shift. Whereas previously the most characteristic practice and most pervasive popular image of the male homosexual were effeminate, over the last twenty years the predominant styles of gay men have become increasingly masculine. The most obvious aspect of these new styles is clothing. The central styles have been the 'clone', partially supplanted in the mid-1980s by the sportsman. Alongside these have grown other, more specialist images: the leatherman/biker, the construction worker, the squaddy, the skinhead, the cowboy. Many, though not all, of these styles of clothing mimic those of occupations and pursuits which are strong male preserves. But the prescribed forms of masculinity extend beyond dress to gestures and 'body language' (no longer the limp wrist, no more 'mincing'), to ways of speaking (no more screaming and lisping), to language (we are no longer to be 'Miss So-and-so'). The change is also present in the body: hours in the gym are required to create, not necessarily an inflated muscle man, but a male-athletic body. The category of the sportsman, and to a large extent that of the leatherman, is centred on this notion of the masculine body. The opposition here is not merely femininity/masculinity but male/female: the body is to be what-is-specifically-male, thus apparently rooting the new gender style in physiology, the social in the biological.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned from Child Sexual Abuse Research: Prevalence, Outcomes, and Preventive Strategies",
      "abstract": "Until recently, there was much disagreement as to what should be included in the definition of CSA [1]. In some definitions, only contact abuse was included, such as penetration, fondling, kissing, and touching [2]. Noncontact sexual abuse, such as exhibitionism and voyeurism, were not always considered abusive. Nowadays, the field is evolving towards a more inclusive understanding of CSA that is broadly defined as any sexual activity perpetrated against a minor by threat, force, intimidation, or manipulation. The array of sexual activities thus includes fondling, inviting a child to touch or be touched sexually, intercourse, rape, incest, sodomy, exhibitionism, involving a child in prostitution or pornography, or online child luring by cyberpredators [3,4]. CSA experiences vary greatly over multiple dimensions including, but not limited to: duration, frequency, intrusiveness of acts perpetrated, and relationship with perpetrator. Although sexual activity between children has long been thought to be harmless, child on child CSA experiences, such as those involving siblings, is increasingly being recognized as detrimental for the emotional well-being of children as adult on child CSA [5-7]. While adult-to-child interactions in which the purpose is sexual gratification are considered abusive, sexual behaviours between children are less clear-cut as there is no universal definition of sexual abuse that differentiates it from normal sex play and exploration [8]. Although a 2to 5-year age difference between children was first suggested as necessary to consider sexual behaviours between siblings to be incest [9], this criterion is being questioned as studies have shown this age difference to be much lower in many substantiated cases of child-to-child abuse [10]. This formulation of CSA is in keeping with the recommendations from the 1999 World Health Organization Consultation on Child AbusePrevention, where CSA is defined as any activity of a sexual nature 'between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person'. That said, some definitional issues have not yet been resolved in the field. First, much disparity exists regarding age for sexual consent, or age for sexual maturity, which has an influence on the extent to which statutory sex offenses are considered CSA. Sexual activities that involve a person below a statutorily designated age fall under the large umbrella of CSA; however, the age of consent varies greatly across countries, from as young as 12 or 13 (e.g. Tonga, Spain) to 17 or 18 years of age (e.g. some states in the US, Australia). In virtually all European jurisdictions, sexual relations are legal from age 16 onwards, but some countries have set the age for sexual consent at 14 or 15 [11]. In other words, when no coercion or force is used, cases that involve sexual activities between an adult and, for example, a 14-year-old teenager, will be either perceived as a consensual sexual relationship or criminalized and defined as sexual abuse, depending on the legal statutorily designated age of the country where the event occurred. In Canada, a bill was recently adopted to change the age of consent from 14 to 16, a premiere in Canada's history, which emphasizes the impact governmental decisions can have on definitional issues of CSA in societies over time [12]. Second, although coerced sexual activities that occur in dating or romantic relationships is recognized as a form of sexual violence by the World Health Association (see for example a WHO multicountry study from Garcia-Moreno and colleagues [13]), the extent to which this form of interpersonal violence is socially recognized and acknowledged in different legislations around the world is unclear.",

      "abstract": "Sexual function is a complex interaction of neurovascular and hormonal factors and is influenced by biological characteristics, interpersonal relationships as well as cultural, traditional, and social features (1).Sexual disorders refer to disruptions in psycho-social tendencies and changes in characteristics associated with sexual response cycle.It is considered as a cause for anxiety and problems in interpersonal relationships (2) that affects well-being, quality of life, and lifestyle of women (2-4).According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sexual dysfunction has been introduced as a side effect in stages which are known as sexual response cycle or intercourse-associated pain (5).This definition emphasizes that human sexual response cycle model is a chronological sequence and consists of several coordinated stages including sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction (6).Epidemiology of sexual dysfunction in women is poorly understood because few population-based studies were carried out on the prevalence, determinants, and consequences of women's sexual dysfunction (7,8).In addition, socio-cultural barriers, taboos and false beliefs make it difficult to estimate sexual dysfunction prevalence which seems actually underestimated (9).However, population-based studies regarding the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women have been increased in the past decade in order to better identify and understand the impact of this problem on women's lives, and these studies have been conducted in different countries, cultures, and age groups (10).It is estimated that 40 to 50% of women in the United States are suffering from sexual dysfunction and the problems associated with sexual dissatisfaction which have been reported in 87% of older women (7,8).Rouzi et al showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among Saudi and non-Saudi female healthcare providers was high (11).In Iran, few studies have been done on the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women (12).Ramezani Tehrani et al showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women in four provinces of Qazvin, Kermanshah, Golestan, and Hormozgan was 27.3% and dysfunction in the stages of desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm was 35.6%, 39.9%, 18.9%, and 27.3%, respectively; and 15.2% of them were dissatisfied with their sex life (13).The prevalence of sexual disorders in other studies was reported to be between 31 and 66% (12,14,15).Dissatisfaction with sexual performance has always been one of the few causes of divorce and marital conflict.Bolhari et al showed that sexual problems are the cause of Abstract Objectives: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent nowadays and is a threat to healthy marital life.The aim of the present study was to determine the factors associated with sexual dysfunction in newly married women referred to the urban health comprehensive services centers of Zanjan, Iran in 2015-2016.Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 women married in the last 5 years who referred to the health centers in Zanjan.The participants were selected through cluster sampling method.Data were collected using a socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Female Sexual Function Index.Descriptive and analytical statistics including independent t test, one-way ANOVA, and the general linear model were used to analyze the data.Results: Sexual dysfunction was found in 66% of the women.The frequency of sexual dysfunction was 33% for arousal, 31% for pain, 28.7% for desire, 23% for satisfaction, 3% for vaginal lubrication, and 16.3% for orgasm dimensions.According to the general linear model, breastfeeding and contraceptive method had a significant relationship with the mean score of sexual function.Conclusions: About two-thirds of women in their early years of marriage had sexual dysfunction, and given its impact on all aspects of marital life, it seems necessary to include sexual counseling in the pre-marital counseling program.",

      "abstract": "The female menopause is considered to be a result of a decrease in the endocrinal metabolic activity of the ovaries. Although the male lacks such a highly visible sign as the cessation of the menstrual flow, the amount of testosterone produced by the aging male does in fact decrease. Recent studies, such as the Massachusetts Male Aging Study show that, between the ages of 40 to 70 years, the mean testosterone level decreases annually by about 1%. Chronic diseases and the use of drugs have a comparable effect. Although it is generally believed that sexual impotence is a major symptom of male menopause, recent investigations have shown that sexual functionability may be preserved into the ninth and tenth decade of life. Sexuality is not merely an instinct or a psychological expression, but is deeply anchored within the personality. Even when, with increasing age, the frequency of sexual dysfunction increases, such changes do not correlate with the decrease in testosterone levels. None of these phenomena take place within an age span that marks them off from the involution processes in other organs. The expression midlife crisis commonly met with in the English literature points up the psycho-social implications. Impotence or a loss of sexuality is not a sequel of aging, but of attitude towards sexuality. The latter is preserved if it is not neglected throughout the course of a lifetime.",

There are relatively specific effects of X‐linked genes on social cognition, language, emotional regulation, visuospatial, and numerical skills. Many human X‐linked genes outside the X–Y pairing pseudoautosomal regions escape X‐inactivation.

      "title": "Female Ornaments and Signaling",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual selection researchers refer to a variety of morphological features that capture the visual attention of conspeci0cs (notably, those of the other sex) but do not function as weapons or shields but as ornaments (Bradbury &amp; Vehrencamp, 1998; the Latin root of the word means “to adorn or decorate”). Examples include patches of skin that are brightly colored, gatherings of colored feathers, feather plumes, and elongated or elaborated 0ns and tails. The same term, however, aptly applies to olfactory and acoustical traits that attract attention from conspeci0cs, notably in sexual contexts. In most animal species, males are the more ornamented sex (Andersson, 1994). Nonetheless, females in sex-role-reversed species, some socially monogamous species, some polygynous species with male territoriality or other mating systems, and some Old World primates possess ornaments. In Old World primates, female ornaments are referred to as sexual swellings—enlarged, often differentially colored anogenital areas. Old World primate females with multimale, multifemale social arrangements (e.g., most macaques, man- drills, baboons, and chimpanzees) typically possess sexual swellings, but so, to lesser degrees, do a monogamous gibbon and a harem polygynous langur (Dixson, 1998; cf. Pagel &amp; Meade, 2006). Female sexual swellings occur in other mammalian taxa and at least one species of bird (see review in Dixson, 1998). Relatedly, some female primates and other species display a sexual skin, a differentially colored anogenital region with- out accompanying edema (swelling).",

      "abstract": "It is no wonder that questions of the meaning and practice of desire and sexuality have vexed many feminist thinkers given the sorts of assumptions regarding women's association with the body we explored in Chapter 2. After all, if women are not clear on the significance of their bodily being, what precisely does it mean to be a sexed and desiring bodily being? Why have people typically been so convinced that particular types of sexed bodies dictate particular types of behaviour and sexuality? Does the possession of XX or XY chromosomes (or any other variation) really have an impact on people's behaviour, let alone on their desiring practices? What about same-sex desire? In addition, how should such desiring and sexually embodied practices as pornography, prostitution and sexual violence be understood? Probably more than any other, questions of sexuality and desire test contemporary theories regarding embodiment.",

      "title": "Psychosocial aspects of contraceptive use.",
      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

In the case of sexual actions, the affects of fear, anger, and disgust are usually antagonistic to sexual final acts because they are not \"appetitive parts \"of the attachment and erotic motivation system. Affects facilitate drive activity when they appear in the same area of organization and inhibit them when they appear in another area. Within the thinking and writing about perversion, two perspectives, which are not mutually exclusive, can be distinguished. On the one hand, perverse creations could be regarded as creative play forms of human life, which are in no way concerned with either the courts or therapy. On the other hand, most experts agree in that perversions represent a severe disturbance, with links to psychosis, fragmentation, and alienation.",

These reasons are five in number: homosexuality is held to be unnatural, abnormal, a perversion, morally wrong or sinful and aesthetically repellent or disgusting. The first three of these unfavourable characterisations of homosexuality apply to it primarily as an orientation, a disposition to engage in homosexual activity, whether the disposition is manifested or not. The other two, the moral and aesthetic ones, so far as most of their proponents are concerned, apply only to homosexuality, as manifested in actual conduct. The desire to sin, after all, is a necessary condition of virtue. There is no merit in not doing things one has no desire to do. Similarly the desire to do something disgusting is hardly, in itself, disgusting.",

It is an invisible tool primarily deployed against women and is based solely on a woman's biological identity. Discrimination in any form is fundamentally wrong, since it is based on a characteristic that is immutable (without external processes) and is reflective of stereotypical and contrived perceptions of a particular group. Sexism originates from the overemphasis of biological differences between men and women, differences based on the physiological distinctions between the male and female bodies, but more specifically, on the reproductive capacity of women. It is not merely this distinction that constitutes sexism. Rendering one sex superior to the other constructs a system that translates into definitions of gender that flow from this biological distinction. Other discriminatory practices that stem from these arbitrary notions regarding biological diversity include racism, classism, heterosexism, and ageism.",

Often there are only few indications that hardly allow conclusions regarding everyday life. This complexity of the issue already starts with the definition of aphrodisiacs, as the term covers the whole range from essential remedies to luxury items increasing sexual performance. The use and the social prestige of aphrodisiacs in the Early Modern Period depended on gender and social background. Because of the large number of plant, animal and chemical substances, which were regarded as helpful to increase potency or libido, it may be assumed that the issue was indeed important and significant. Smooth transitions and grey areas were also typical for the aphrodisiacs themselves: Often it was only a small step from love and passion to magic, witchcraft, crime, and murder.",

Sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. The World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases defines sexual problems as ways in which an individual is unable to participate in a sexual relationship as he or she would wish. There are four major categories of sexual problems: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders. Sexual arousal disorder in men, erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity.Orgasmic disorders In men, premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. Sexuality has been explained in the Ayurveda classics in detail along with the various disorders related to desire, arousal, orgasmic and sexual pain disorders. The various formulations have been explained in classics to relieve these disorders and help the man to enjoy their sexual life.Considering these issues the need of hour this conceptual study has been carried out to help, support and provide enhanced sexual life with readily available pure botanicals which are time tested evidenced based and 100% safe and effective.",

They often have a history of trauma. They are depressed and obsessive, attached to their mothers, who discourage attempts at emancipation. The symptoms serve the purpose of keeping them as little girls with negative feelings toward menstruation, sexual maturity, development, and femininity in general. These symptoms comprise self-destructive behavior in the service of removing sexual thoughts, temptation, and activities. Favazza (1987) included both eating disorders and self mutilation in his \"deliberate self-harm syndrome.\" The symptoms, whether they be anorexic, bulimic, or a form of self-mutilation are seen as \"autoerotic in nature and a substitute for normal masturbation\" (Hull & Lane, 1988). Eating disorders and delicate self-mutilation are said to have \"a cathartic, self-purifying, function in that they modulate states of anxiety, sexual tension, anger or dissociated emptiness, and they bring about a tremendous quasi-physical sense of relief\" (Cross, 1993, p. 50). These patients' use of substitutes prevents maturation and growth as women, causing regression to pregenital phases with the use of pregenital defenses, and the demise of the demands of puberty and mature sexuality.",

Some have endured gross insensitivity, disrespect, indifference, imbalance in give-and-take, or ingratitude. Substance abuse or destructive family patterns may have compromised or even ruined what could have been so much better. Sometimes we become unusually dependent on those who have died-to the point at which some of us have merged our identities with theirs, deferred to them on almost all decisions, or allowed them to manage nearly all details of our lives. Some of us have struggled with another’s attempts to control, manipulate, dominate, or even possess us. Some of us have been abused and actually harmed physically, sexually, or psychologically.

Couples in their 50s or older expect continued sexual involvement, but most consider intercourse the only legitimate form of sexual exchange and reject other forms of sexual activity. Sexual dysfunctions which impair coital ability, especially ejaculatory difficulties in the male and genital atrophy and loss of vaginal lubrication in the female, are frequent. Menopausal couples are often not knowledgeable about physiologic aging changes that affect sexual performance and are reluctant to communicate sexual difficulties to their partner. Without professional counseling and/or pharmacologic intervention, these conditions may lead to sexual frustration and abstinence. The identification and treatment of problems, as well as patient education, are imperative in caring for the menopausal patient.",

The most widespread are linguistic genders (also referred to as noun classes) – grammatical classes of nouns based on core semantic properties such as sex (female and male), animacy, humanness, and also shape and size. The choice of a gender (or noun class) may not be semantically transparent. Classifiers of several types are a further means for categorizing nominals. Numeral classifiers – the most widely represented type – categorize the nominal in terms of its inherent nature, animacy, shape, and form, and occur next to a numeral or a quantifier. Numeral classifiers divide into sortal and mensural. Noun classifiers accompany a noun and categorize it in terms of its inherent properties. Possessive classifiers categorize a noun with a possessive construction. Or the nature of the nominal can be reflected in a classifier on the verb, or a suppletive classificatory verb. Each type of nominal classification devices has its preferred semantic parameters. Nominal classification systems tend to reflect social relationships. Grammatical gender is prone to reflect the stereotypes associated with social gender – the social implications and norms associated with being a man, or a woman, or a further gender category.",

There is nothing about pleasure dysfunction in the official medical sexual nomenclature, for example, and there's nothing in university-level or medical sexuality texts about the physiological bases of pleasure, cultural differences in pleasure, or the psychological development of pleasure. Only some use the term \"pleasure\" to describe experiences such as slipping into cool water on a hot day or tasting a spoonful of a perfect flan or hearing a Mozart concerto or dancing the samba. As psychocultural history kicks in, experiences get hooked to meanings: and pleasures and can move far beyond the sensory or sensorimotor. Physiological sex research on people has necessarily used non-invasive methods and different endpoints, and some surprising results have emerged.",

This abuse produces many behavioral, emotional, and physical problems in adult life. One such consequence is adult sexual promiscuity. Anxiety which arises over childhood abuse may be dealt with by compulsive or addictive behaviors. Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed. Four case histories show examples of male and female promiscuity following childhood abuse.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

      "title": "Profiling of online pedophiles",
      "abstract": "Paraphilias represent a group of disorders characterized by a pathological sexual tendency or anomaly, with the impulses including intense sexual fantasies and urges that keep returning in regard to the unusual objects, activities, circumstances, and/or certain category such as the children. Pedophilia belongs to this group of disorders and it is alternatively labeled as a pedophile disorder, which includes specific incriminated actions, which in addition to prison sentences, generally result in a social stigmatization of not only perpetrators but victims too. It is a sexual affinity disorder mostly found in adults who have expressed sexual fantasies and a tendency to enter the sexual relations with children of the same or the opposite sex. Nowadays, a \"digital space\" has become a unique environment where these specific crimes take place, and the border between the virtual and real world is practically indistinguishable. In this digital environment, pedophiles and other sexual predators have got a new space in which they establish spontaneous contacts with potential victims (often with children). In a manipulative way, they recruit vulnerable individuals with the aim of various forms of abuse and sexual exploitation. Considering the fact that it is a delicate and variable disorder, which calls for an interdisciplinary approach, profiling these persons is crucial in relation to any countermeasure. Profiling is also necessary to systematically investigate the symptoms, nature, and factors of psychopathological conditions and deviations in the existences of the affected persons. After all, it is one of the ways of reaction to make pedophilia more visible as a part of preventive programs before the late manifestation. In this paper, there are applied the methods of a quantitative and qualitative content analysis, comparative analysis (reaction to pedophilia) as well as a descriptive and analytical statistics. The purposeful goal is to recognize pedophilia as a sociopathological phenomenon that requires an adequate response from the social community.",

There is debate about whether these patterns of exercise occur in isolation, or whether they always accompany other disorders; furthermore, there is virtually no evidence on the biological substrates of this condition. It must be noted that exercise is frequently a socially lauded behavior. Individuals who exercise excessively may therefore not have absorbed critical personal or societal feedback about their behavior, and be less conscious of its negative impact. This can pose a particular challenge in recruiting these individuals for studies which aim to provide insight into the nature of this disorder.",

There is no conceptual restriction on the range of intentional objects those desires, activities, and pleasures can take. Neither is there good conceptual reason to privilege any class of them as paradigmatic. Since the quality unifying the sexual is not morally significant, the morality of sexuality is no different from morality in general.

Some scholars tend to include in the sexual context every phenomenon which either implies genomic rearrangements or exposes to them, in particular if they imply exchanges of segments of DNA. However, if the sex is not conceived as a phenomenon which can occur by means of any occasional mechanism, but by means of specific mechanisms, then its meaning is rather restricted. According to this interpretation, the sex does not include the contingent genomic closeness due to infecting viruses. Incidental events of this kind frequently occur both in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes regardless of the presence of any specific structure which promotes it. Rather, there is often the presence of specific structures and mechanisms to withstand such events. Therefore, the extension of the term sexuality to infective cell pathology or occasional events seems to be a source of indeterminateness more than a useful definition of a class of phenomena, although it is sometimes difficult to mark a precise boundary, at least in the evolutionary sense, between all possible kinds of genomic contiguity.",

      "abstract": "In sociology and cultural studies, the body is often treated only as a symbolic space, as a surface on which sexual meanings are written and from which they are read. Realist philosophy of science and philosophy of mind, however, do not treat discursive meaning as arbitrary and disconnected from the material universe. Using a realist framework, this paper examines areas of collision between values and beliefs about matters of fact concerning men's and women's sexual bodies and sexual pleasure and displeasure. Groups campaigning for and against male circumcision do not argue directly against each other. The first draw on health justifications, while the latter raise difficulties about human rights and loss of sexual sensitivity. Measuring penile sensitivity proves to be difficult. When sexual satisfaction is understood as traditional masculine role adequacy in reproductive coitus, there is no way of understanding complaints about loss of receptive sensuality. Debates about the structure and nomenclature of the clitoris, about the existence of female ejaculation and about the evolutionary function of the female orgasm similarly founder when the protagonists do not share a conceptual framework: macroscopic anatomic structures and physiological processes become invisible to observers and false assumptions are made, for example about when and how orgasm occurs. Most sexual difficulties are not physical dysfunctions, but failures to meet social rules of sexual behaviour. In conclusion, the paper draws attention to issues insufficiently addressed in contemporary sexuality studies and calls for practical engagement by social researchers with public health and policy.",

      "title": "Normal feline behaviour: … and why problem behaviours develop",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: Cats are descended from a solitary, territorial ancestor, and while domestication has reduced their inherited tendency to be antagonistic towards all animals larger than their typical prey, they still place more reliance on the security of their territory than on psychological attachments to people or other cats, the exact opposite to dogs. Many feline problem behaviours stem from perceived threats to this security, often due to conflicts with other cats. Others are more developmental in origin, often caused by inadequate exposure to crucial stimuli, especially people, during the socialisation period. Strongly aversive events experienced at any age can also contribute. A third category comprises normal behaviour that owners deem unacceptable, such as scratching of furniture. Evidence base: This review identifies three areas in which basic research is inadequate to support widely employed concepts and practices in feline behavioural medicine. First, classification of cats’ problem behaviours relies heavily on approaches derived from studies of their behavioural ecology and, to some extent, extrapolation from canine studies. Few studies have focused on cats in the home, the environment in which most behavioural disorders are expressed. Secondly, cats’ chemical senses (olfactory and vomeronasal) are far more sensitive than our own, making it difficult for owners or clinicians to fully comprehend the sensory information upon which they base their behaviour. Thirdly, although the concept of psychological distress is widely invoked as an intervening variable in behavioural disorders, there are still no reliable measures of distress for pet cats in the home. Global importance: Psychological distress of some kind is the primary cause of many of the behavioural problems presented to clinicians, but surveys indicate that many more cats display the same clinical signs without their owners ever seeking help. The welfare of this ‘invisible’ group could be improved by veterinarians taking a more proactive approach to educating their clients about the behavioural needs of pet cats.",

It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. The same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

La non-recidive qui est le signe de la desistance ne suffit donc pas pour qu’on puisse parler de resilience car la conformite normative peut etre simplement un abandon adaptatif au meme titre que la delinquance pouvait l’etre. Meme si une delinquance violente peut etre le fruit d’un moi faible, d’une incapacite a tolerer les frustrations ou a controler les ecluses du passe, une grande part de la delinquance repose sur des mecanismes adaptatifs adequats quand bien meme ils sont moralement ou juridiquement inacceptables. Pour que la resilience secondaire se mette en place il nous semble que des mecanismes supplementaires tels que la sublimation ou un sursaut narcissique engendre un investissement d’objet hors soi. Plusieurs cas nous montrent que ces personnes sorties de la toxicomanie ou de carrieres delinquantes plus ou moins severes se sont appuyees sur un etayage narcissique externe ou sur des mecanismes de defense tournes vers la generativite pour entreprendre des actions sociales altruistes ou des activites educatives ou theâtrales qui qualifient la resilience secondaire.",

For determinate-sentence men these two variables were predictive neither of length of sentence nor of likelihood of reconviction (whether in general or specifically for arson) when multiple-regression techniques were used. The life-sentence arsonists do not form a homogeneous group but include some men whose crimes have a compulsive element and may be sexually motivated; such men are to be found in the determinate-sentence population, but they are less common there.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse: Forensic Medical Assessment of the Traumatic Injuries Over the Victim’s Body",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is a public health problem that affects children worldwide in all ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups. These assaults are extremely dangerous not only due to their direct physical traumas received at the time of the abuse, but they also have long-term consequences that can worsen the future quality of the victim’s life. A retrospective study of all cases related to child sexual abuse for five years was performed by materials of the Clinic of Forensic Medicine and Deontology, Sofia, Bulgaria. Ninety-five cases involve children from both genders. The traumatic injuries were carefully examined and classified according to their localization over the victim’s bodies and based on the time that had passed after the reported assaults. In cases of sexual violence, the most informative and pointing at the exact type of violence are the injuries situated in the anogenital area. Too often, there is a lack of physical findings, depending on the type of sexual violence or associated with the prolonged time that passes after the crime. Children are unaware of what they have to do after suffering such traumas, or they are scared to share their experience with different family members, which can lead to late forensic examination and lack of physical and biological findings, which are the most critical traces in the criminal prosecution of the crimes and this can be a possibility for the perpetrator not to be charged for his unlawful actions.",

They gender it – which is to say they proceed from it not as productions but as the expansion itself that it “is,” if this can be called “being,” grasped in its nonexistence or rather meontology. Sex brings forth emotions, motions, forms, figures, textures and flavors, wounds and pains – the effervescent expression of its nonidentity or pluriidentity. This difference to oneself and the dissemination and multiplying effect of sex constitutes the deepest and most difficult lesson in the study of genders, which is far from being finished, though this has less to do with study, perhaps, than with an experience both meditative and amazed of what has always already pushed and driven us through all possible genders outside any kind of gender, assignation, and identification.",

Vordergründig ist allen Jugendlichen daher bewusst, dass Selbstbefriedigung keine körperlichen Nebenwirkungen hat. Bei psychischen Auswirkungen bestehen manchmal nach wie vor Befürchtungen, dass Selbstbefriediung zu einer sexuellen Abstumpfung und Empfindungslosigkeit führen könnte. Doch selbst wenn auf körperlicher Ebene vordergründig keine negativen Auswirkungen der Selbstbefriedigung gesehen werden, sind diese Befürchtungen nicht vollkommen verschwunden. Immer dann, wenn ungewohnte oder unerwartete körperliche Wahrnehmungen auftreten, werden diese sofort mit der Befürchtung in Verbindung gebracht, sie könnten durch Selbstbefriedigung entstanden sein. Wenn während der Pubertät beispielsweise die Haut am Penis oder auf den Hoden dunkler wird oder Talgdrüsenektopien in diesem Bereich auftreten, führen diese völlig normalen Hautveränderungen zur Verunsicherung und zu der Frage, ob es möglicherweise an der Selbstbefriedigung liegen könnte. In gleicher Weise sind oft Mädchen verunsichert, sobald sie bemerken, dass die Schamlippen unterschiedlich groß oder beispielsweise die inneren Schamlippen größer als die äußeren sind.",

      "abstract": "Bodies are ubiquitous in media. Slim and fit bodies, obese and carnivalesque bodies, young and old bodies, murdered and mutilated bodies, alien and machinic bodies appear constantly on our television and computer screens, producing diverse modes of entertainment, engagement, and contestation. Media are also ubiquitous in bodies. Media technologies such as personal computers, cell phones, and gaming consoles transform and extend our bodies in all kinds of ways, often leading to cyborgian materialities and subjectivities. Even though people often think of media technologies as producing \"virtual\" as opposed to \"physical\" environments, the body is never absent in media. Bodies can be transcended or reconfigured in online environments, in the sense that children can become adults and vice versa, men can become women and vice versa, bodies can be differently abled, but the body is never absent. Being online often means being seated in front of a computer screen or at the very least having a smartphone in one's hand or pocket. People have sex in Second Life and have of course been having \"phone sex\" for decades (Stone 1995). As Mark Hansen (2006: xvi) puts it, the contemporary moment is one in which we are seeing \"the exteriorization of the human into a convergent media platform and the massive infiltration of technics into the body.\" So while our bodies are never absent, the use of media technologies does transform the ways in which we are embodied.",

Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer easily call upon the notions of unproblematic sex and sex role as organic aspects in ‘healthy’ natural objects like organisms and families. Likewise for race, ideologies of human diversity have to be developed in terms of frequencies of parameters and fields of power-charged differences, not essences and natural origins or homes. Race and sex, like individuals, are artefacts sustained or undermined by the discursive nexus of knowledge and power. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic.",

Additionally, exercises such as aerobic or strength training for physical strengthening or yoga, meditation and tai chi for tranquility are also becoming popular among women. These activities are not only fun but also create a sense of fullness, self-love, self-satisfaction and joy in them, further combating issues like depression, anxiety and social isolation.

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria",
      "abstract": "Persons who experience persistent, clinically significant distress about their anatomic sex or assigned gender role have been recognized since antiquity. In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013), these individuals can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in adults appear in Box 39- . Persons with presentations that meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in DSM-5 would have received a different DSM diagnosis—usually either transsexualism or gender identity disorder (GID)—prior to 2013. Consequently, some expert recommendations and empirical studies relevant to the treatment of adults with gender dysphoria refer instead to persons with transsexualism or GID. A brief explanation of these terms is therefore indicated. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults 302.85 F64.1 A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months' duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one's experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify if: With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome). Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria. Specify if: Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female). When disorders involving distress about anatomic sex or assigned gender role first entered DSM in 1980 (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association 1980), they appeared under the superordinate category gender identity disorders. Their defining feature was said to be \"an incongruence between anatomic sex and gender identity\" (p. 261), where gender identity referred to a person's fundamental sense of being male or female. Adults with persistent discomfort about their anatomic sex and a desire to live as members of the opposite sex could receive a diagnosis of transsexualism in DSM-III and DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987). They can still receive this diagnosis in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10; World Health Organization 1992). Males and females with transsexualism are often referred to as male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals. In DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000), the diagnosis of transsexualism was replaced by the diagnosis of gender identity disorder ; as a result, this term applied to both the superordinate category and a specific diagnosis within that category. It has long been recognized that not all adults with GID (the superordinate category) have presentations that meet full diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (the specific diagnosis). Accordingly, both ICD and DSM have consistently provided one or more residual diagnoses for persons with nonclassical or nontranssexual types of GID. These diagnoses could be applied to individuals whose presentations fulfilled some but not all diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (i.e., who were subthreshold for these diagnoses) or who had alternative gender identities but did not identify as the opposite sex (e.g., men who identified as eunuchs and sought only castration, not complete sex reassignment; Johnson et al. 2007). In the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria, the new term experienced/expressed gender —a neologism for gender identity —encompasses a wider range of identities than just the opposite sex. Consequently, it appears that many persons who would previously have been diagnosed with residual or nontranssexual forms of GID would now be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. DSM-5 nevertheless includes two residual diagnoses for persons whose presentations do not meet full criteria for gender dysphoria: other specified gender dysphoria and unspecified gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 descriptions of these diagnoses appear in Boxes 39- and 39- . DSM-5 Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.8 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria . This is done by recording \"other specified gender dysphoria\" followed by the specific reason (e.g., \"brief gender dysphoria\"). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the \"other specified\" designation is the following: The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months. DSM-5 Unspecified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.9 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. Because the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is so broadly encompassing, it is useful to distinguish between adults with gender dysphoria who experience transsexualism and those who experience nontranssexual forms of gender dysphoria. These terms are relatively unambiguous and remain widely used both in clinical settings and in the scientific literature (e.g., Hembree et al. 2009), even though transsexualism has not been a formal DSM diagnosis since 1994. The term transgender can be used to denote persons with significant cross-gender identification or gender-atypical feelings or behaviors, whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.",

Yet not always this deep emancipation of the female job is valorized and appreciated by the other sex: today we assist still to phenomenons of continuous boycottings that are born from the family and in the place of job. The woman imprisoned in a similar relationship it inevitably ends with the losing the image of herself and the physical layer is almost inevitable reactions. The denied identity is often the cause of a refusal of the sexuality and obsessive behaviors is verse her same that toward the partner. Since the initial phase you/they can nest small germs that subsequently you/they can amplify him up to reach exaggerated forms apparently unjustified and/or symptoms of discomfort that don’t find an immediate meaning. The dispareunia and the vaginismus are two diffused and extremely frustrating sexual dysfunctions for the women. The dispareunia points out a recurrent genital pain that prevents from serenely living the sexuality. It defines vaginismus an unintentional spasm of the next muscles of the pelvis to the inferior bystander of the vagina. The vaginismus is a pathology where the psychological component has greater importance. The Author delineates some strategies of therapeutic intervention, introduces some clinical cases and it proposes the most functional formalities to involve the woman\\the couple in the medical and psychological job to overcome the pathology in action. Key words: vaginism,dispareunia, white relationship, competitiveness, tolerance to the conflict, therapeutic strategy, the pathology of the intimacy, strategies in the reception of the patient.",

      "title": "THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CHANGE OF SEX OPERATION",
      "abstract": "The syndrome of male transsexualism is characterized by a life-long preference for the feminine role, predicated on the conviction of belonging to the female sex. This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels “unnatural” in a relationship with a woman, considering this “homosexual.” There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal dormancy (e.g. diapause, hibernation) is widely considered an adaptation for surviving life-threatening conditions during part of the year. However, the selective pressures acting on dormancy are poorly studied. An underestimated common aspect is the high survival rate during dormancy compared to the active period, perhaps due to the reduced risk of predation and competition. We hypothesize that dormancy phenology is influenced by a trade-off between the reproductive benefits of being active and the survival benefits of being dormant. Using a phylogenetic comparative method and more than 20 hibernating mammals, we find that the sex difference in hibernation phenology is explained by sex differences in physiological constraints that may influence this trade-off. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, the sex that spends more time in an activity directly associated with reproduction (e.g. testicular maturation, gestation) or indirectly (e.g. recovery from reproductive stress) spends less time in hibernation. Some of the tested parameters such as testes maturation or a late mating period during the active season also influence the sex difference in dormancy phenology among ectotherms (e.g. reptiles, invertebrates). We then gathered evidence that dormancy in non-life-threatening periods that are unfavorable for reproduction may be more widespread than previously thought.",

      "title": "The evolutionary psychology of men's coercive sexuality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological adaptation underlies all human behavior. Thus, sexual coercion by men could either arise from a rape-specific psychological adaptation or it could be a side-effect of a more general psychological adaptation not directly related to rape. Determining the specific environmental cues that men's brains have been designed by selection to process may help us decide which these rival explanations is correct. We examine six testable predictions against existing data: (1) Both coercive and noncoercive will be associated with high levels of sexual arousal and performance in men. (2) Achieving physical control of a sexually unwilling woman will be sexually arousing to men. (3) Young men will be more sexually coercive than older men. (4) Men of low socioeconomic status will likewise be more sexually coercive. (5) A man's motivation to use sexual coercion will be influenced by its effects on social image. (6) Even in long-term relationships men will be motivated to use coercion when their mates show a lack of interest in resistance to sex because these are interpreted as signs of sexual infidelity. Current data support all six predictions and are hence consistent with the rape-specific hypothesis, but this does not eliminate the side-effect hypothesis, which is likewise compatible with the findings, as well as with the further evidence that forced matings increased the fitness of ancestral males during human evolution. We suggest some research that may help decide between the two hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "* Abbreviations: GAS — : gender affirming surgery GAT — : gender affirmative treatment TGD — : transgender and gender diverse The intersection between gender identity and sexuality is complicated. In gender affirmative treatment (GAT), care is approached by listening to the youth, with the input of their parents and caregivers, to best understand how to affirm and validate their gender identity and expression in the context of their health and development.1 It may include any of the following: social interventions (eg, by using asserted name and pronouns), pubertal suppression, hormone treatment, or gender affirming surgery (GAS), with psychosocial support provided throughout.2 Although empirical support of GAT is growing, the literature often minimizes the fundamental, dynamic connection between intimate relationships and one’s sense of self. For example, intimate activities may be adapted to overcome or avoid gender dysphoria associated with certain sexual parts. Traditional labels (gay, straight, bisexual, etc) may be seen as inadequate and too restrictive given evolving identities. One’s gender label may influence power dynamics and roles in the relationship. Developmentally, young people are navigating these challenges with gender identity and sexuality simultaneously in a process that is not well understood or supported by medical providers. In this month’s issue of Pediatrics, Bungener et al2 examined sexual behaviors among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth during and after GAT. They reviewed previous research suggesting that at the time of referral, before any intervention, TGD youth had fallen in love, … Address correspondence to Jason Rafferty, MD, MPH, EdM, Department of Pediatrics, Thundermist Health Center, 450 Clinton St, Woonsocket, RI 02895.

      "title": "Violência sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsciência e autorrepresentações do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

      "abstract": "Kinship stands at the center of our very existence as human beings, and so does the language we use to refer to different forms of kinship. The Swedish language is strongly gendered in the area of family and romantic/sexual partnership, and based on a constructivist view of language the established vocabulary might contribute to the constitution and perpetuation of normative systems regarding gender and sexuality. The naturalization of heterosexuality and binary cisgender is strongly connected to linguistic practices on several different levels, one of them being individual words and phrases such as gendered pronouns and another being presuppositions manifested linguistically, such as: “What is his name?” when a woman mentions her partner. For my research article, I asked 35 Swedish-speaking persons currently living in Finland about their linguistic practices concerning personal reference to partners and family members, focusing on gendering. The informants all define either their relationship(s) or their family structure (or both) as not conforming to the normative, most of them being non-heterosexual women. Interestingly, genderneutral words were more commonly used than gendered ones when referring to a partner (although no one mentions a non-binary partner), something that may either manifest a tendency toward gender neutral language usage or a wish to avoid homophobic reactions. The act of “coming out” by gendered reference to a partner is mentioned several times. In family structures beyond the normative, the informants and their family members had developed their own ways of referring to each other when the vocabulary is insufficient, and a few of the parents discussed the issue of using gendered language in reference to children. Overall, the informants seemed used to linguistic problem solving as a consequence of their identities and everyday practices clashing with the Swedish language.",

Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Circumcision indeed has psychological, psychosocial, and psychosexual effects. The differences in circumcisions performed during infancy, childhood, and adulthood are remarkable. There are also potential psychosocial effects on parents who may or may not choose circumcision for their children. We argue that additional attention should be paid to the potential for long-term effects of the procedure, which may not be appropriately considered when the patient is an infant or child.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Although sex play is a part of normal childhood development, some sexual activity may be coerced or forced and may have negative long-term consequences and, thus, be considered abusive. However, childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by siblings, cousins, or peers receives relatively little attention from either researchers or practitioners. In the present article, the literature on sibling child sexual abuse is critically reviewed, and particular attention is focused on defining sibling sexual abuse, and determining its scope and effects. Clinical Implications are derived as well. Although the article focuses on sibling sexual abuse, the concepts considered here also apply to other forms of same-age (or near same-age) child sexual relationships.",

Cases should be addressed in terms of their particular characteristics, of course, but a broader approach to the ethical issues inherent in the representation of those with disabilities is to consider the benefits and risks of the three major paradigms of disability available today: the symbolic (or metaphorical), the individual (or medical), and the social (or cultural). The last of these paradigms is best suited to honor both the rights and the interests of vulnerable subjects because it alone acknowledges that disability is not solely an individual concern.",

The relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. Similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. Survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. Such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. All abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. As dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victims—passive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetrators—taking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Racial violence arises when infantile anxiety and hatred of ‘difference’ or ‘otherness’ become too unmanageable within the self and are displaced into the racial arena via splitting and projective mechanisms. The body of the ‘other’, particularly skin colour differences, becomes a salient target for locating and attacking these feared and unwanted aspects of the self. Those on the receiving end can experience a profound attack on their identity, with feelings of rejection that can result in a severe narcissistic blow, puncturing and even shattering the individual's psychic skin and existing defensive organization. This failure of containment can send tremors throughout the psyche to some of the most vulnerable areas in individuals functioning, giving fresh life to both oedipal and pre‐oedipal anxieties to do with separation and loss. Where these early anxieties are felt to be unbearable, the individual resorts to encapsulating them in a portion of their mind, effectively sealing them off from conscious awareness or access, but they are unconsciously re‐enacted. A case study aims to describe some of these phenomena.",

Mature males show a preference for large body size in a sexual partner and may begin the courtship behaviour pattern with other fish of either sex unless the visual stimulus of the sword-tail or aggressive actions are perceived. The response of the female to the vent-butting stage of the male in the courtship movements acts to release either the sexual or the aggressive display pattern in the courting male. The sexual behaviour of the female consists of a decrease in avoidance activity which appears to be related to the reproductive cycle and no-co-operation by the female is required for copulation to occur. Certain other observations are described and their possible significance is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Having spent Chapter 1 unpacking some of the deep structures at work in the oppression of women and considering how feminists have tried to address these, it is time now to discuss the impact these structures have had on actual embodied women. Hence, although “the problem that has no name” might remain multifaceted, it is clear that it directly affects those with female bodies, albeit in diverse ways. Possessing a woman's body has meant, for instance, not possessing the right or capacity to control everything that happens to or is expected of that body. Women's bodies are, after all, like their lives, affected on all sides by various forms of explicit and implicit social, political, legal, symbolic and discursive control. Women cannot rely, for example, on having the right to decide whether or not to start, continue or terminate a pregnancy, or even whether or not to have sex. They also cannot easily prevent being valued and/or objectified on the basis of their physical appearance and how that appearance matches up with prevailing – and perhaps even impossible – cultural norms and ideals, including those based on colour and race. (The Barbie-doll phenomenon, the jezebels and mammy stereotypes, many people have argued, have a lot to answer for.)",

      "abstract": "Human asexuality has been defined as a lack of sexual attraction to others, although its nature is not well understood. Asexual men's genital and subjective sexual arousal patterns were compared to sexual men's to better understand asexual men's sexual response patterns. Using a penile plethysmograph to measure genital arousal, 20 asexual, 27 heterosexual, and 22 gay cisgender men (M age = 28.28, SD = 9.41) viewed erotic films depicting sexual activity or masturbation, and a subsample engaged in sexual fantasy of their choosing. Questionnaires assessing sexual function and behavior were also completed. Asexual men scored lower on sexual desire and orgasmic function, higher on sexual aversion, and did not differ on overall sexual satisfaction. Compared with gay and heterosexual men, asexual men demonstrated lower genital and subjective sexual arousal to the erotic films but displayed similar sexual arousal when engaging in sexual fantasy. Asexual men's lower levels of sexual excitation rather than their higher levels of sexual inhibition were associated with lower responses to the erotic films. These findings suggest asexual men have preferred sexual stimuli that differ from sexual men and have a similar capacity for sexual arousal as sexual men. Collectively these findings add to a growing literature aiming to understand the nature of asexuality.",

Indeed, without the sensations of pleasure and displeasure we would be unlikely to repeat or restrict behaviors. Since repetitive sexual activity over the millennia has ensured the continuance of the human race, it is perhaps surprising that pleasure has received little attention in the research literature on sexual function and behavior. By exploring sexual pleasure and motivation theories and studies relevant to the evaluation of sexual function and dysfunction, a goal response model is presented. This model proposes a route from sexual stimuli, via cognitive and emotional processing to behavior and subsequent feedback, which illustrates how eudemonic goals could influence treatment outcomes.",

However, it is not known whether the ability to detect female fertility is primarily a function of biological sex, sexual orientation, or a combination of both. Using methodologies from previous T-shirt studies, we asked women not using hormonal contraceptives to wear a T-shirt for three consecutive nights during their follicular (ovulatory) and luteal (non-ovulatory) phases. Male and female participants of differing sexual orientations then rated the T-shirts based on intensity, pleasantness, and sexiness. Heterosexual males were the only group to rate the follicular T-shirts as more pleasant and sexy than the luteal T-shirts. Near-significant trends also indicated that heterosexual men and non-heterosexual women consistently ranked the T-shirts, regardless of menstrual stage, to be more intense, pleasant, and sexy than did non-heterosexual men and heterosexual women. Recommendations for future research, including suggestions for methodological changes, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this paper I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that, health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

Social signals are in fact more intensive and more conspicuous in many cases where captive animals are compared with those in the wild, and certain signals (and their significance) are rendered much more obvious when seen at the highest level of intensity. Only the possible biological function of these signals have been discussed, whilst the underlying physiological causes have been considered only in passing. In addition, the morphological features of the genital signals vary widely from species to species, as is common for other intraspecific signals. Sexual signals also have social significance, presentation acting as a greeting ceremony. In the female the sexual skin activity primarily underlines the sexual presentation. The main source for counterbalancing intra-group agonistic tendencies is behaviour patterns and/or signals from the sexual and brood-care context.",

      "title": "The impact of delayed reporting on the prosecution and outcomes of child sexual abuse cases",
      "abstract": "Children and young people who have been sexually abused sometimes disclose that abuse soon after the event or events occurred, or at least later during childhood. However, many children and young people do not tell anyone about the abuse until decades later, long after they reach adulthood. An unknown number, the ‘dark figure’, never tell anyone or if they do, do not report it to the police. Delayed disclosure and reporting are associated with various characteristics of the victim and perpetrator, and the relationship between them. Older children, for example, are more reluctant to disclose than younger children, and boys are more reluctant than girls. Delayed reporting is particularly common in cases of institutional child sexual abuse; for example, where the abuser is a trusted church member, a teacher, or a staff member in a boarding school or residential care facility. In some cases, the victim has told someone at the time, but has not been believed, or the complaint has not reached the police. Where an adult has reported sexual abuse committed against them as a child, particular forensic difficulties stand in the way of prosecution that do not apply to contemporary reports. These include needing to prove the offence as it was on the statute book at the time it occurred, and addressing issues about the reasons for the delayed complaint. Another barrier to successful prosecution is the likelihood of ‘degraded evidence’. As time goes on, memories fade and evidence which may have corroborated some aspects of the complainant’s account may have been lost; for example, due to the death of another witness. This report examines how the criminal justice systems in New South Wales and South Australia deal with complaints of child sexual abuse reported to the police in childhood compared with those in which the report is delayed until adulthood, which is often referred to as historical child sexual abuse. The research investigates the trends in delayed disclosure and reporting of child sexual abuse, and maps the prosecution process and outcomes associated with varying degrees of delay in 18 reporting to the police, together with other case characteristics such as the age of the complainant victim, and the relationship between the complainant and the alleged offender.",

Es gibt aber auch körperlich gesunde Männer, die in ihrem Leben bei einem versuchten Koitus keine Erregung hatten. Ihre sexuelle Reaktion ist derart gehemmt, daß sie daran zweifeln, jemals sexuelle Befriedigung mit einem Sexualpartner zu finden. So kann zum Beispiel ein Junge von einer besitzergreifenden Mutter erzogen worden sein, die ihm niemals gestattete, sich selbstständig zu entwickeln. Oder es wurde ihm beigebracht, daß Sexualität etwas schmutziges, gefährliches sei. Versagt er dann beim ersten Koitus, so kann er unfähig werden, die negative Erfahrung zu überwinden. Ein anderer Mann verspürt möglicherweise homosexuelle Tendenzen; dieser zu bewältigende Konflikt kann zum Versagen führen. In diesen Fällen ist eine intensive Sexualtherapie erfolgversprechend, denn der Betroffene benötigt mehr Hilfe als er von seiner Partnerin erwarten kann. Tritt eine Sexualstörung vorübergehend auf, sind die Partner am besten beraten, zunächst die Situation zu akzeptieren und sich klar zu machen, daß ein Mann nicht zwingend eine Erektion benötigt, um die Partnerin zu befriedigen. In den meisten Fällen wird ein Mann ein anderes Mal, unter günstigeren Bedingungen, wieder eine Erektion bekommen.",

Characteristics of the postpartum sexual abstinence include: 1) 4-6 years of abstinence 2) consistent observation by the Dani of the abstinence 3) lack of explanation of the custom or the enforcement of sanctions by the Dani 4) lack of other sexual outlets in the society such as masturbation homosexuality beastiality or overt polygymy and 5) no signs of unhappiness or stress. The behavior and attitudes of the postpartum abstinence are described in detail. Low levels of emotional energy invested in sexuality are also observable in other activities of the Dani such as the rate of birth extramarital sex homosexuality child-rearing practices initiation rites use of the penis sheath or gourd teenagers play interpersonal interaction intelligence as reflected in abstract thinking and the expression of art and adaptation to change and health. In all but one of these activities e.g. teenagers play there is always a low expression of energy; teenagers songs drawings and string figures often illustrate explicit sexual actions. In comparison of the two views of sexual energy the relativistic and the more common Freudian ones Heider concludes that the Danis sexual behavior is culturally derived and fits closely with the view of Dani society as a low level energy system. Using comparative examples causes of low energy sexuality are suggested to be a result of the lack of seasonality in the region or more likely the low stress and stimulation of infants. However no causal factors seem sufficient enough to explain the phenomena of low level sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Religion's historical mistrust of sexuality shapes people's behavior by inhibiting liberal sexuality. Still, it is unclear whether this inhibitive role also includes common, normative sexual behavior, particularly in secularized contexts. Moreover, the possible mediating effects emotions, affects, and thoughts have on the association between religiosity and restricted sexuality have never been integrated into a single model. Finally, cross-religious differences in common sexual behavior have still yet to be documented. We addressed these three issues in two studies, with samples of Catholic and Muslim tradition (total N = 446). Consistently across samples, religiosity predicted, either directly or indirectly, less frequent common heterosexual behaviors and masturbation, partly through sexual guilt and inhibition, and/or decreased sexual fantasy and the search for sexual pleasure. However, married Muslims’ religiosity, unlike Catholics’, did not directly undermine fertility-oriented sexuality and the search for pleasure. Religion's role in restricting sexuality seems to be rooted in deep psychological rationale.",

      "title": "Menopause and the workplace: consensus recommendations from The Menopause Society",
      "abstract": "Menopause is a natural life transition experienced by half the world's population. Women aged 50 years and older are the fastest growing demographic group in many countries, making essential contributions to the workforce. Although menopause is a universal and natural life transition, the symptom experience is highly variable among women. Some women may experience few or no symptoms, whereas others may be bothered by moderate to severe symptoms for a decade or longer, which can adversely affect quality of life, relationships, job satisfaction, and career advancement. Indeed, menopause symptoms, including vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms, as well as sleep and mood disturbances are associated with multiple adverse work outcomes. Studies to date have demonstrated that these adverse work outcomes related to menopause symptoms include a compromised ability to work, reduced work productivity, absenteeism, and even loss of employment or an early exit from the workforce. Further, the relationship between menopause symptoms and work may be bidirectional, with certain aspects of the work environment being linked with a greater menopause symptom burden, such as insufficient restroom facilities, unpredictable or long work hours, the inability to take breaks, and confined or crowded workspaces. Thus, workplace solutions may need to be tailored based on women's individual needs, the work environment, and the type of work.The Menopause Society, in conjunction with an expert panel of medical and legal experts and women's health advocates, has developed a set of consensus recommendations that challenges employers to create a menopause-supportive workplace for their employees. These recommendations include, among other things, suggestions for employers to review policies and healthcare plans and benefits and to consider flexibility and accommodations that may be needed for some women with menopause symptoms. Guidance for women with menopause symptoms that affect them at work in terms of understanding their resources and empowering them to be self-advocates are also provided, as well as recommendations for what occupational health professionals should know and do for women with bothersome menopause symptoms in the workplace.",

      "title": "Sexual Aggression against Children",
      "abstract": "Male sexual aggression against children is a serious and alarmingly common social problem. Treatments for the perpetrators have been only moderately successful. Perhaps a reason for this has been the absence of a unified model of etiology and treatment that includes the most salient motivational factors unique to various subtypes of perpetrators. Such a model would have to be sufficiently flexible to account for the various sexually aggressive modes of expression without being unnecessarily complex or simplistic if it is to be clinically useful. Specifically with respect to sexual aggression against children, a quadripartite model is proposed that includes physiological sexual arousal, cognitions that justify sexual aggression, negative affective states, and personality problems as motivational precursors that increase the probability of sexually aggressive behavior. The relative prominence of these precursors is used as a guideline for assessing and treating particular subtypes of perpetrators. Failure to consider the primary motivational precursor during the initial stages of treatment also may account for the limited success of current treatments.",

Past sexual abuse is often discovered in adolescents and adults consulting for mood or sexual identity disorders and addictive behaviors. These patients did not receive any psychological treatment because their parents quickly “forgot” the event. Thus, recovery is impossible: judicial redress has not been started and there is no family recognition of the harm and trauma. The reactions of parents can promote or block the “healing” process, and unsupported children can feel resentment towards their parents. The request for clarification is left hanging and will influence the psychological makeup of the future adult and the quality of their relationship with their parents. Parental silence is generally underpinned by sociocultural considerations, such as the judgment of others, resignation, or divine will.",

      "abstract": "\"Little boys play with dump trucks and little girls play with dolls.\" A stereotype for sure, but persistent because children do seem to display sex-based toy preferences, though, of course, some girls prefer dump trucks and some boys prefer dolls. At an early age, these role reversals are often discouraged—girls and boys may be verbally or physically bullied when they don't conform to what other children (and adults) think they should play with. Parental permission must be secured, and in some instances, a parent or guardian may be required to be with the child during the experiment. Another consideration is realizing the natural limitations of children (in terms of boredom, fatigue, energy level, etc.). Hormones may affect toy choices indirectly, perhaps through an influence on activity level, motor skills, abilities, or temperament. Further, natural variations in levels or availability of testosterone among normal males and females might contribute to individual differences in sex-typed behavior.",

      "title": "Understanding Multiple Sexualities",
      "abstract": "The language that we invent to describe experience tends to shape the experience. This is very clear with respect to human sexuality. To date, in part due to religious injunctions which still exist in many parts of the world, our languages of sexuality have been limited (see Weeks, 2011). The ways in which we describe our sexual selves to others, and think privately about our identities and desires, are often impoverished. How, for example, would a mid-30s man describe himself based on a series of same-sex relationships during his teens, a 10-year exclusive relationship with a woman, and bondage fantasies involving older, sexually ambiguous partners? Due to a host of reasons he might choose straight, but he might also select bisexual. Currently, an expanded list might include queer and BDSM-curious, but the choices are limited, and any term or set of terms selected might even be disputed. With respect to English, we operate with a relatively restricted terminology for sexual identities, desires, and experiences that can lead to confusion, anxiety, and even social conflict. This restricted use of language at times lags behind the dramatic changes in the sexual world that have occurred since the 1960s, although Scott's (1998) research would suggest that the so-called Sexual Revolution was anything but revolutionary in terms of impact on sexual values and ethics. There were certainly some effects, and these social changes were well summarized by Weeks (2007):",

      "abstract": "Infertility may interact with a couple's or individual's sexuality and sexual expression in two main ways. Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

Thus, sexual ornaments may function to attract or deter (i.e., threat) conspecifics. We suggest that males and/or females assess mate quality and discriminate among potential mates by using a variety of cues, including seasonal variation in steroid levels that relate to gonadal development.",

This research was conducted on a multigenerational sample, given the acknowledged role of sexuality in life satisfaction, considering age and generational characteristics. In general, previous articles do not work with more than one generation at a time or do not focus specifically on generational cohorts. The relationship between life satisfaction and sexuality has been much discussed in previous research, but not in intergenerational studies. Most articles focus mainly on the younger population, data regarding the older age group is scarce. Sexual functioning and sexual dysfunctions are often targeted psychological variables of sexuality. Problematic online pornography use is however a less researched topic, especially in the case of older generational cohorts, like Gen X and Baby boomers. As formerly presented, sexual functioning has a key role in adult life satisfaction, but there is a scarcity in cohort-based approach, when generational identity is considered.",

      "title": "Frightened men: a wish for intimacy and a fear of closeness.",
      "abstract": "Men who failed to achieve an adequate separation from their mothers are particularly prone to experience serious distress with their marriages during their middle years, when the wish for intimacy, coupled with a fear of closeness never resolved during infancy, is retriggered. An onslaught of biological, social, and psychological stresses force acknowledgement of previously denied needs for succor, plunging them into battle with their wife-surrogate mother. The resulting counterphobic, hypersexual, ofter self-destructive behaviors are usually falsely interpreted as oedipal. Clinical material in this report strongly suggests this distress is not primarily related to genital sexual issues or fears of castration, but more often concerns issues of autonomy and independence which typically involve the mother and which arose in the toddler or anal phase. Supportive evidence for this thesis from cross-cultural observations, child developmental studies, and primatology is presented, and the usefulness of this view in facilitating clinical work with such men is described.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to define sexual disturbance today because concepts about emotional disturbance in general and sexual disorder in particular have recently undergone signifi cant changes. Sexual disorders may be seen in terms of (a) specific aberrant acts or (b) the psychological and philo sophic causes that underlie such acts. It would appear to be more meaningful to define them largely in relation to the self- defeating ways in which and reasons for which an individual behaves sexually rather than in terms of the concrete behav iors he performs. When so viewed, the basic causes of sexual disorders seem to be quite the same as those of most general emotional difficulties. Societal reaction to disturbed indi viduals with sexual problems has improved in recent years but is still much too condemnatory and punitive. At the same time, some social thinkers, in a misguided effort to pre vent the persecution of sexually troubled and deviant indi viduals unrealistically refuse to face the facts of their intrinsic neurosis or psychosis and trace all their upsets to social persecution. Sexually disturbed persons are not easy to treat successfully for a variety of reasons, especially by conven tional psychoanalytic methods. But if a hard-headed thera pist actively-directively intervenes in their lives and induces them to challenge and work against their irrational value systems, he may achieve effective results in a relatively brief period of time.",

Affected patients need a comprehensive assessment that includes taking a sexual history, medical evaluation and, if appropriate, a manual examination in order to diagnose, treat or identify factors relevant for each individual woman. There may be biological, psychological, emotional and relationship issues. Any biological factors such as vaginal dryness, pelvic floor dysfunction or chronic pain need to be addressed first to help prevent more complex problems developing. Sexual problems may be the cause of or the result of dysfunctional or unsatisfactory relationships. Psychological and emotional factors can create difficulties in sexual response and, equally, they can be the result of unaddressed or untreated biological/medical issues. Nurses working in urology need to be aware of the physiology involved in sexual response and know which conditions and illnesses are likely to affect sexual functioning and which treatments can help.",

Are we referring to the gonads, secondary and accessory sex structures, physiology, brain, behavior, or to all of the above elements. If these elements are not concordant, the exceptions can prove illustrative of underlying processes at both the proximate and ultimate levels. At each of these levels, “sex” is the binary outcome resulting from the modulation of conserved networks of genes, proteins, cells, organs, and, in the case of the brain, discrete nuclei. These networks operate at multiple and sequential levels that usually are linear during the lifespan, but in some instances reversals are possible. For example, the gonads arise from a single “anlagen” and, in most instances, ovaries or testes result, although ovotestes are the norm in some species and gonadal reversal a property of other species. Other sexually dimorphic structures differentiate from multiple “anlaga” by reciprocal and sex-specific atrophy/hypertrophy, typically in an exaggerated manner, although the capacity to develop structures characteristic of the opposite gonadal sex remains inherent and intact. A perspective that integrates these different properties are presented here.",

      "abstract": "For millennia, relationships have developed between animals and people through the context of work, sport, companionship, or some combination of these activities. Often, a bond between animal and human results, which is based on affection and/or respect. In the research environment, it is not uncommon for a bond to develop between the investigator, veterinarian, and/or animal care technicians and the animals with which they work; and such a bond can be just as strong for a mouse as it is for a dog. Circumstances that foster the formation of these bonds include the close and frequent contact between the researchers and their animals during studies or during training of animals to particular tasks, the long periods of time many research animals live in the facilities (often years), the dependency of the animals on the animal care staff for their daily needs, and the veterinarian/patient relationship, which is not unlike that of private practitioners and client-owned animals. In addition, overlaying the fundamental relationship with the research animal are special bonds that can form with certain animals. Among those that engender a special attachment are animals that are particularly friendly, amusing, or intelligent; animals requiring extra supportive care; animals that show courage; animals that represent a milestone in a particular scientific advancement; and animals that reflect humans' own strengths and foibles. The development of these relationships is enriching to both personnel and animals inasmuch as people who care about their animals are committed to promoting and ensuring the well-being of those animals.",

But childhood, although it is influential, does not finally determine the personality characteristics of the adult individual. This is evident from the fact that people who have very similar childhood experiences often exhibit very different personality traits in their adult activities and relationships. Psychoanalytic theories of childhood, especially where they place emphasis on the long-term effects of unresolved unconscious conflicts at oral, anal or genital stages of development, often appear to be highly determinist, not to say pessimistic, concerning the influence of childhood on the adult.",

This study investigated whether spectatoring (i.e., negative self-directed attentional focus during sex) mediates the association between penis appearance concerns and sexual dysfunction. Men in romantic relationships (N = 512, in predominantly mixed-gender relationships) reported on sex they had with their partner in the previous month. Indirect effects indicated that penis appearance concerns predicted greater spectatoring, and in turn predicted greater erectile and orgasmic dysfunction. Results suggest that spectatoring is a conduit through which penis appearance concerns impede sexual function.",

With respect to the sex difference in tolerance indicated by the findings, some of the comments concerning rigidity under cultural pressure would apply by way of explanation. Frequently in the social realm, it may be noted that a subordinated, restricted minority group may introject the controls imposed from without. It is probably easier to live under cultural pressure when virtue is made out of necessity and controls are assumed to be natural and proper rather than irrational and arbitrary. It is well known, for example, that the humble noncommissioned officer in a military system may be a staunch upholder of discipline, especially for others. There should be no rash generalizations beyond the limited findings of this modest experimental study, but experimentation does provoke theorizing; and from empirically oriented theorizing may come more and better experiments.",

In particular, the role of specific environmental and occupational factors is incompletely elucidated. Various occupational (physical and chemical) agents have been shown to affect male reproductive functions in animals, but large differences in reproductive function and/or xenobiotic handling between species limit extrapolation to humans. When available, human data are often conflicting and, except in a few instances, usually refer to broad and heterogenous occupational categories or to groups of agents (e.g., solvents). It is often difficult to elucidate the role of a single agent because occupational exposure conditions are often complex and various confounding factors related to lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, and diet) or socioeconomic state may also affect sperm quality, fertility, or pregnancy outcomes.The objective of this work is to summarize the main epidemiological and, where relevant, experimental findings pertaining to agents (physical and chemical) encountered in the occupational environment that might affect the male reproductive system (sperm count, motility and morphology, libido, and fertility) and/or related pregnancy outcomes (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, and birth defects and childhood malignancy in offspring). Some methodological issues related to research on the reproductive effects of toxicants are also discussed briefly.",

In realta la sessualita espressa da pazienti con Demenza puo essere espressa, talora drammaticamente, sotto forma di comportamenti sessuali inappropriati (ISB). Sulla definizione di tali sintomi comportamentali, non c’e al momento, nella letteratura scientifica internazionale una concordanza di vedute, tuttavia gli ISB comprendono una qualsiasi forma di agito verbale o fisico messo in atto in un contesto socialmente inappropriato. Esempi di ISB sono: esposizione dei genitali in pubblico o nel luogo di ricovero, masturbazione in pubblico e forme di aggressione sessuale nei confronti di degenti, operatori o familiari tanto che questi aspetti sono spesso fonte di preoccupazione, imbarazzo e fatica per chi si relaziona con questa tipologia di pazienti. La ricerca e di conseguenza la letteratura disponibile sui trattamenti e al momento piuttosto limitata. Interventi di tipo non farmacologico (tecniche comportamentali, strategie di distrazione, terapia occupazionale) possono essere efficaci se personalizzate. Numerosi trattamenti farmacologici (con antidepressivi, antiandrogeni, antipsicotici, ed anticonvulsivanti) vengono utilizzati empiricamente, tuttavia solo poche evidenze sono disponibili nella letteratura scientifica riguardo l’efficacia e la consistenza degli effetti collaterali, tanto che non esistono chiare linee guida in grado di precisare quali siano da considerare trattamenti di prima o di seconda linea.",

      "abstract": "In spite of the fact that masturbation involves almost all human beings in every culture, comparatively little has been written on the subject. Until very recently masturbation was defined in the medical literature as a sexual perversion and a damaging activity to be prohibited at all costs. In the beliefs of certain religious faiths masturbation is considered a sin. The evolution of masturbatory activity as observed from infancy through adolescence is presented. Masturbation can be understood as a \"discharge phenomenon\" undertaken to relieve a state of tension existing in the human body. As the child develops he is normally subjected to increased tensions due to restrictions and frustrations forced upon him by the family and culture. Being permitted no normal outlet, he resorts to the release he has known from infancy, and has the fantasy that certain forbidden or temporarily impossible wishes take place. The feelings of guilt, increased by parental attitudes, are associated with a fear of having damaged their sexual organs and a fear of consequent ill health. Excessive masturbation as defined, must be viewed as a symptom of the child's unhappiness or emotional instability. The role of the pediatrician is to explain ordinary masturbation to the parent as a normal physiologic function. When the physician is presented with the problem of a child with excessive masturbation he should attempt to detect factors responsible for an emotional upset.",

      "abstract": "Apotemnophilie, Amputee Identity Disorder oder Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) bezeichnen das intensive Gefühl, der Körper wäre „kompletter” nach der Amputation eines Gliedes. Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach übereinstimmenden Persönlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele für auslösende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende Körperteil häufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Geprüft wird, ob es Parallelen zu körperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches Körperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens völlig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in ärztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der gängigen Theorie einer ZNS-Läsion nicht erklärbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines „perfekten” Körpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Schönheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als „Helden”, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche Störung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. Stärke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekundärer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensität des sexuellen Interesses.",

      "title": "FACTORS IN MALE SEXUAL INADEQUACY",
      "abstract": "1) A representative selection of the enormous literature on factors generally held to be causally important in male potency disorders is reviewed. Although some degree of overlap may exist, for simplicity, the subject is considered under the three main \"etiologically presumed\" subgroups: \"organic,\" \"constitutional,\" and \"psychogenic.\" The pathognomonic features of each are briefly outlined. 2) Since most authorities state that \"psychogenic factors\" are dominant in male potency disorders, the review concentrates on a sample of this literature; contributions from a) psychoanalytical, psychoanalytically-oriented, b) eclecticist, and c) behaviorist sources are evaluated. The most frequently asserted \"psychogenic causes\" of male potency disorders encountered are a) anxiety or fear, b) hostility and resentment, c) disgust, d) inversion of the sex drive, e) inhibition, f) personality factors, g) ignorance and misinformation, and h) the functional psychoses. It is concluded that, with the possible exceptions of the functional psychoses and inverted sex drive, where there is a strong clinical likelihood, if not as yet a proven statistical association, no definite statement regarding the etiological importance of the other \"psychogenic factors\" can be made using the presently available material. In most cases, etiological generalizations have been made on inadequate nonspecific data, often derived from single or a few case studies. Another serious criticism relates to interpretation of observations; for example, that anxiety, hostility, disgust, and other such factors or a functional psychosis might coexist with a potency disorder is incontestable, but to assume causality may only rarely be admissible; more often these may be its consequence or a mere coincidence. 3) Some suggestions for improving the methodology of psychological research on etiological factors in male potency disorders are offered and may include a) greater empiricism, b) more stringent criteria for inclusion in any study which should be explicit, prospective, controlled, modest, and replicable by others, c) the use of standard objective validated measuring instruments, and d) the application of appropriate statistical methods. 4) Despite the consensus view widely expressed in the literature that potency disorders are psychosomatie, few, if any, workers have attempted specifically to measure simultaneously and to correlate physiological and psychological responses in these or related conditions. 5) It is suggested that, in the future, a multidisciplinary and simultaneous approach, involving psychiatric, psychological, and physiological parameters will provide better and more valid methods of studying the etiological interrelationships between various \"psychological factors\" and disordered potency.",

      "abstract": "Marked differences have been found in men’s and women’s sexual response patterns, contingent upon their sexual orientation; androphilic (attracted to men) and gynephilic (attracted to women) men demonstrate greatest genital and self-reported arousal to their preferred stimulus type (a “gender-specific” response), whereas androphilic women do not, and findings for gynephilic women have been mixed. While there have been many investigations into gynephilic men’s and androphilic women’s (i.e., heterosexual men/women) sexual response, there has been less investigation into the specificity of sexual response of androphilic men and gynephilic women. Given the complex nature of sexual stimuli that are used in sexual response research, it is often unclear to what extent contextual cues (e.g., cues other than the sexual actor’s primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, sexual activity, etc.) influence participants’ sexual response patterns. As such, the current study examined genital, discrete self-reported, and continuous self-reported responses of androphilic men ( n = 22) and gynephilic women ( n = 10) to prepotent sexual features (stimuli thought to elicit automatic sexual arousal: erect penises and exposed vulvas), non-prepotent sexual features (flaccid penises and pubic triangles) and neutral stimuli (clothed men and women). Both samples exhibited a gender-specific pattern of genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported sexual arousal. Similarly, all measures of sexual arousal were generally found to be greatest to “prepotent” sexual cues. Implications for understanding gender specificity of sexual response are discussed.",

The primary, interrelated forms of commercial sexual\nexploitation of children – often referred to as CSEC – are\nprostitution of children, child pornography and trafficking of\nchildren for sexual purposes. Commercial sexual exploitation of\nchildren exists because there is a demand for it.

      "title": "Food and Love in Sanskrit Poetry: On the Margin of Desires",
      "abstract": "In Western representations, food and sex are frequently connected and compared in an erotic context. A survey of Sanskrit poetry shows that it was not so in the context of ancient India, despite the kāmaśāstras’ dictates. Parts of women’s bodies are occasionally likened to certain items of food (mostly fruit and nectar), and can sometimes be drunk, but are rarely said to be eatable. Lovers who are madly in love or suffer from the pangs of separation lose their appetite, and in consequence become thin. In contexts of love-in-union, wine, but not food, is frequently consumed and appreciated for its aphrodisiac qualities. Except in some cases when the pairs of lovers are animals, or at least animal-like, descriptions of food consumption do not lead to the erotic flavour (śṛṅgāra-rasa), but rather lead to the comic (hāsya), sometimes disgusting flavour (bībhatsa-rasa). Food descriptions were probably considered improper for poetry, because food had too many unerotic associations, being a favourite topic of Sanskrit ritual, legal and medical treatises.",

After spinal cord injury (SCI), the modification of neurologic control and its consequences on reproductive organs have been extensively described in humans. Globally, sexual satisfaction decreases but sexuality remains a major concern, specifically after the first year following the injury.1 Moreover, recovery of sexual function is the major concern of paraplegic patients before locomotion,2 after the acute rehabilitation phase. For these specific sequelae/ complications we have to keep in mind that the majority of patients are male and young.3 The impact of the neurologic lesion and its physiologic consequences must be balanced by the fact that the quality of life with respect to sexuality after spinal cord lesion concerns more the relationship with a partner and mental well-being rather than the preservation of sexual ability.1,4 In clinical practice it is well known that this population have specific problems such as dissociation between sensation, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. Such dissociation is only seen in cases of neurologic lesion. Erection can be improved by several treatments, but sensation is not modified, and furthermore the ability to ejaculate during intercourse is not improved by any of the available treatments.",

Women's emancipatory potential cannot be realized through accumulation of contrasting characteristics (e.g., emotionality vs. achievement orientation, etc.). The context of women's daily life in household, family, among friends and acquaintances and the professional work related to this sphere is usually not more closely analyzed, even though women (dissatisfied and protesting) clearly relate to this sphere and are oppressed by its everyday routine. The problems of the female role are neither made comprehensible nor explained sociologically through the contradictory structures of this sphere; rather, they are usually attributed to the specific socialization training process of the young female child, in which girls, as compared to boys, experience less encouragement to be independent, more parental care, less cognitive and social pressure to establish unique identities (independent of their mothers) and more hygienic training.",

      "abstract": "Men's sexual overperception bias-where men tend to perceive greater sexual interest in women's behavior than actually exists-is a well-documented finding in previous research. All of the existing research, however, has tested this effect in the context of initial encounters or for fictitious or unknown targets. No research currently exists on how people perceive their romantic partner's sexual desire in the context of ongoing, intimate relationships. In 3 dyadic studies, we provide evidence that men in established romantic relationships err in the direction of the opposite bias and underperceive their romantic partner's sexual desire. We also demonstrate that this underperception bias is functional (particularly for men) in that it is associated with their partner feeling more satisfied and committed to the relationship. In addition, people are particularly likely to underperceive their partner's desire on days when they are motivated to avoid sexual rejection, and men's underperception bias is, in part, accounted for by men's higher general levels of sexual desire than women. The current studies extend previous findings on sexual perceptual biases and demonstrate the important role of context in men's judgments of a partner's sexual interest. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Verschiedene medikamentöse und adjuvante Strategien können hier erfolgreich eingesetzt werden. Schlussfolgerung und klinische Relevanz Nicht immer lassen sich sexuelle Nebenwirkungen, sexuelle Störungen oder Partnerschaftskonflikte vollständig verhindern. Dennoch sind ein offener und ehrlicher Kommunikationsstil und eine gründliche Prüfung von möglichen Vorgehensweisen, um dieses zusätzliche Leiden depressiver Patienten zu lindern, möglich.

The main cause of vaginismus is not known, but is often considered multifactorial. This paper aims to describe the factors that contribute to vaginismus. Case: A 26 years old, married woman, health practitioner presented with the complaint of not being able to have sexual intercourse. About 1 month ago, since marriage, the patient was unable to have sexual intercourse with her husband. The patient feels guilty and anxious because of the inability to please her husband. The patient's father was very dominant and was a \"religious\" type of parent who always gave advice with religious aspects regarding all matters. The patient's mother was a nervous person and always said that what the father said was a law that had to be obeyed. Likewise, talk about sex is a taboo topic of discussion and is considered embarrassing. Discussion: Many factors need to be explored related vaginismus. In the case, the biological aspect can be ruled out because the patient has consulted with the ob-gyn doctor. from the psychological aspect; perceptions, attitudes and attitudes towards sex and the values ​​held by parents contribute to vaginismus in this patient.

      "title": "Comentario editorial a «Función sexual femenina asociada al uso de cintas libres de tensión para el manejo de la incontinencia urinaria de estrés»",
      "abstract": "El nacimiento de un niño/a con algún tipo de desorden del desarrollo sexual plantea situaciones que involucran tanto los aspectos biológicos como los sociales. En este sentido, es indiscutible que un recién nacido/a con «ambigüedad genital» confronta las concepciones más usuales acerca de sexo, género y papeles sexuales, por cuanto se espera que un cuerpo sexuado se comporte, en los ámbitos públicos y privados, acorde con las expectativas sobre la orientación hacia a un ser masculino o femenino. Sin embargo, el ser intersexual rompe con este paradigma, ocasionando –como todo lo relativo al sexo y género– múltiples representaciones, prejuicios, discriminaciones y significados que afectan severamente la vida y los derechos de estas personas.En los últimos 20 años se han modificado las prácticas médicas de «normalización» del cuerpo, verdaderas «intervenciones» quirúrgicas que hoy se realizan bajo criterios muy seleccionados, respetando el sentir y los derechos de los niños con desórdenes del desarrollo sexual y posponiendo muchos de los actos quirúrgicos de «corrección genital» que se hacían en la infancia.El objetivo de este trabajo es recabar las narrativas y experiencias de los médicos especialistas que atienden a niños con desórdenes del desarrollo sexual en el Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, en Bogotá.The birth of a child with some kind of sexual development disorder creates situations involving both biological and social aspects. In this regard, it is indisputable that a newborn with 'genital ambiguity' confronts the most common conceptions about sex, gender and sexual roles, because it is expected that a sexed body behaves in public and private environments, in line with expectations of being a male or female. However, the intersexual person breaks this paradigm, producing, like everything related to sex and gender- multiple representations, prejudice, discrimination, and meanings that severely affect the lives and rights of these people.In the last 20 years, medical practices have changed the 'normalization' of the body, with surgery now being performed under highly selected criteria, respecting the feelings and rights of children with sexual development disorder, and postponing many of the surgical acts of \"genital correction\" that were made in childhood.The aim of this work is to collect narratives and experiences of medical specialists who treat children with sexual development disorder in San Ignacio University Hospital in Bogotá.",

      "abstract": "Measured against other Western democracies at the dawn of the twentieth century, the American state stood out as distinctive. A homosexual-heterosexual binary, in other words, was being inscribed in federal citizenship policy during early years. Homosexuality is thus a legal category as much as a medical or psychiatric one. The state is notoriously difficult to conceptualize and write about. Citizenship fosters \"internal differentiation and hierarchy,\" by incorporating some into citizenship in a way that highlights their subordination or \"degraded status.\" The regulation of homosexuality in women was also affected by the overall broadening of homosexuality that state policies had helped to bring about. State policies directed at sex/gender nonconformists have generally not operated by targeting large numbers—and especially true for the earlier period. An alternative approach might look vertically at local-state-federal interaction rather than horizontally across several institutions of the federal state.",

      "abstract": "Deviance is defined by negative reactions enacted by audiences to behaviour, expressed beliefs, and/or the possession of undesirable characteristics. Audiences vary in their reactions; what’s wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another—hence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

      "abstract": "We replicated and extended (N = 495) what is known about the relationships between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and a wider range (than previously reported) of sociosexuality including risky sexual behaviors (e.g., lack of condom use) and sexuality in relation to dating applications like Tinder, in general, in men and women, and above agreeableness. Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to most sociosexual behaviors and attitudes. In men, Machiavellianism was linked to various sociosexual outcomes, in women those outcomes were associated with psychopathy instead. Agreeableness was hardly correlated with sociosexual outcomes. The Dark Triad traits were more strongly correlated with the studied outcomes even after controlling for agreeableness or for the dark core. Unexpectedly, men who were Machiavellian and agreeable reported the most sex partners in different contexts, but not psychopaths. In contrast, women who were psychopathic not only had more sex partners in general, but they also engaged in more unprotected sex, and one-night stands than men did. These findings build on prior research on the Dark Triad traits and their associations with sociosexuality and help to draw a more nuanced and modern picture of those relationships.",

How we choose to express our sexuality depends on a number of complex factors that affect many aspects of our lives. The term sexuality refers to the totality of a being—to human qualities, and not just the genitalia and their function. It includes all of the qualities—biological, psychological, emotional, social, cultural, and spiritual—that make people who they are. People have the capacity to express their sexuality in any of these areas. An expression of the psychological aspect, for example, is the person's inner self-concept—I am a man or I am a woman, or I am \"half a man,\" or I am no longer attractive. By viewing sexuality holistically, the health care provider can better understand how a spinal cord injury can affect a person's total health (48).",

He treats the pervert (paraphiliac) with contempt and speaks of him as a degenerate, though the term carries a connotation of moral opprobrium that has no place in medical work.

      "title": "Biological Sex Differences in the Workplace: Reports of the End of Men are Greatly Exaggerated (As Are Claims of Women’s Continued Inequality)",
      "abstract": "Common examples of perceived workplace inequality – the “glass ceiling,” the “gender gap” in compensation, and occupational segregation among others – cannot be well understood if the explanation proffered for their existence is limited exclusively to social causes such as discrimination and sexist socialization. Males and females have, on average, different sets of talents, tastes, and interests, which cause them to select somewhat different occupations and exhibit somewhat different workplace behaviors. Some of these sex differences have biological roots. Temperamental sex differences are found in competitiveness, dominance-seeking, risk-taking, and nurturance, with females tending to be more “person-oriented” and males more “thing-oriented.” The sexes also differ in a variety of cognitive traits, including various spatial, verbal, mathematical, and mechanical abilities. Although social influences can be important, these social influences operate on (and were in fact created by) sexually dimorphic minds. Substantial changes in the environment of a complex organism will often result in changes in its behavior. Therefore, we should not be surprised when changes in the economy or changes in the nature of work are followed by changes in workforce behavior and, hence, changes in workplace outcomes. For those keeping track of “the numbers,” these changes may be characterized as either increasing or decreasing equality, depending upon the particular definition of equality selected. Moreover, whether one views a particular outcome as a harbinger of the “end of men” or a reflection of continued sexual inequality of women may be a consequence of whether the focus is on group averages or the tail end of distributions. It may turn out, for example, that even if women may do better as a group on some measures, men may still dominate at the top.",

Yet, little is known about which behaviors people might experience as compulsive. Using YouGov America, a non-probability sample was collected, matched to U.S. representative norms, stratified, and weighted based on sample characteristics to ensure representativeness (N = 2,806; Mean Age = 48.9, SD = 17.3). Participants reported if they had experienced any concerns about their sexual behaviors being either \"out of control\" or \"an addiction.\" Participants who endorsed such concerns were then asked to indicate which behaviors had led to such concerns, using a checklist of 11 potentially overlapping sexual behaviors (e.g. frequent casual sexual encounters, using apps to find sexual partners). Men—both heterosexual and gay/bi/other–were more likely to report concerns that their sexual behaviors were an addiction, relative to heterosexual women. Relative to heterosexual women, men of any sexual orientation were more likely to report pornography use as a specific behavior of concern, and less likely to report partnered sexual behaviors. More religious participants were more likely to endorse masturbation as a behavior of concern and less likely to endorse frequent casual sexual encounters.",

      "title": ",,,Appropriating Women’s Thoughts: The Admissibility of Sexual Fantasies and Dreams Under the Consent Exception to Rape Shield Laws",
      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim’s sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim’s physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman’s thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. \r\n\r\nThe same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception—women who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women’s sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

      "abstract": "Frotteurism is a perverted sexual behaviour wherein the person tends to rub or bring about physical contact between his genitals and an unrelated female or male to derive sexual pleasure. Moreover, frotteurism is a common phenomenon among the general population which usually goes unnoticed or overlooked. Nevertheless, public frottage has legal implications in almost all countries over the world. But, when frotteurism manifests on the backdrop of psychiatric illness or as a developmental abnormality then it is worth discussing what the legal liability would be. The present case report is based on hypersexual frotteuristic behaviour manifested on the background of a concealed psychiatric illness, featuring depression and obsessive compulsive disease. The hypersexual behaviour manifested in the form of masturbation with features of frotteurism and subsequent development of depression. Nevertheless, compulsive manifestation of frotteuristic behaviour and subsequent development of morbid depression is rare. This paper describes a 12-year-old boy having unrestrained impulsive frotteurism with his peers, school mates and with his younger brother. He was conscious of the fact and feeling guilty of what he was doing but unable to restrain himself. It was followed by the development of symptoms of depression which was treated with Sertraline. Concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation measures were taken too. There was complete remission of the symptoms 6 months after the onset of treatment and without relapse thereafter. The paper discusses the differential diagnosis and management of hypersexual behaviour.",

      "title": "Gender is a multifaceted concept: evidence that specific life experiences differentially shape the concept of gender",
      "abstract": "Gender has been the focus of linguistic and psychological studies, but little is known about its conceptual representation. We investigate whether the conceptual structure of gender—as expressed in participants’ free-listing responses—varies according to gender-related experiences in line with research on conceptual flexibility. Specifically, we tested groups that varied by gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender-normativity. We found that different people stressed distinct aspect of the concept. For example, normative individuals mainly relied on a bigenderist conception (e.g., male/female; man/woman), while non-normative individuals produced more aspects related to social context (e.g., queer, fluidity, construction). At a broader level, our results support the idea that gender is a multifaceted and flexible concept, constituted by social, biological, cultural, and linguistic components. Importantly, the meaning of gender is not exhausted by the classical dichotomy opposing sex, a biological fact, with gender as its cultural counterpart. Instead, both aspects are differentially salient depending on specific life experiences.",

      "abstract": "La violencia basada en género, que expresa el imbalance de poder entre hombres y mujeres, es una transgresión a los derechos humanos de las mujeres y un problema de salud pública muy antiguo y que compromete todas las sociedades del mundo. Se admite hoy en día que más de un tercio de las mujeres ha padecido violencia (psicológica, física o sexual) en algún momento de sus vidas. La violencia sexual es la versión más extrema de violencia contra la mujer y concurre usualmente con los otros dos tipos de violencia. Se puede presentar en todas las etapas de la vida y ni siquiera el embarazo constituye un factor protector. Las personas más cercanas a las víctimas (pareja actual o anterior, sus familiares o personas conocidas), generalmente con poder sobre ellas, son los perpetradores más comunes. Se puede identificar algunos factores asociados, como el alcoholismo, la ignorancia, la permisividad social, la mala relación entre las parejas, el uso de drogas y otros. Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud física (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones pélvicas y de transmisión sexual, embarazos ectópicos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espontáneos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresión, ansiedad, síndrome postraumático, síndrome posviolación, trastornos del sueño, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene también impacto social (costos derivados de la atención de la salud y de la atención legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo). Por las graves repercusiones que tiene la violencia sobre las mujeres y la sociedad en general, debe ser enfrentada con información, educación, trabajo con grupos de varones y mejor preparación de los servicios de salud, apoyo legal y social.",

      "abstract": "Intersectional perspectives in postcolonial theories and gender studies have long argued that femininity represented in museums and exhibitions is subjected to multiple forms of othering. 1) Acquired social modes of looking at artifacts, women and/or Others correlate with androcentric male gaze that passivizes the object being looked at. 2) Women’s social roles in binary androcentric system further render femininity and feminine activities as associated with passivity. Thus, reproduction, care, and socialization as women’s tasks are symbolically relegated to domestic, immanent sphere as a type of work that merely maintains the continuity of a society’s life. 3) In traditional patriarchal schemes, then, transcendental masculine activity is linked with political, economic, scientific, and decision-making realms that are socially constructed as more influential and significant factors in shaping history, thereby being viewed as more worthy of remembering and recording. 4) Representations of minorities in terms of their gender, racial, class, sexual and/or indigenous identities in institutions safeguarding knowledge and historical memory take place in a pre-defined and pre-mediated context shaped by Euro-centric, Judeo-Christian, orientalist epistemologies, which inherently relate knowledge to power and objectification. Tackling such a value system and epistemological bias posits a major challenge for today’s museums, institutions of memory and educational approaches. The following article follows suit in discussing the theoretical and practical potentials of decolonial methodologies which have been formulated from bellow by (formerly) othered, gendered, racialized and objectified positions. The text seeks to demonstrate some of the opportunities this standpoint offers in analyzing a case of (more or less) good practice in the American Museum of Natural History in its attempt to contrast historical narratives pertaining to early European settlements in what is now New York City. Further, elaborating on the tradition of quilting in the U.S., human zoos and exhibits of the Berlin Wall beyond Europe, the article argues for nuanced contextualization and intersectional methods in current musem work.",

Though - according to the results of medicinal surveys - there is no biological limit for a satisfactory sexuality during old age, after personal interviews with 500 random sampled people the hypothesis was confirmed, that older people are often thought to be asexual. Especially older women, who in most cases have no more sexual relations, often believed sexuality in age to be inappropriate, indecent, perverse or even sinful. More than that it could be shown, that sexual inactivity of older people cannot be explained by detoriation of old age only - like illness or loss of partner -, but that the normative evaluation of sexuality is probably an important determinant also.",

The use of animal models has had and may continue to have a tremendous impact on medical progress. Laboratory animals are now used in the study of basic (patho)physiological mechanisms, in the development, production and evaluation of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, in safety studies to assess carcenogenic, teratogenic or reproductive toxicity of investigational agents, and in education and training. The quality or utility of a model often depends upon its validity, which is highest in so-called homologous models where the symptoms displayed as well as the cause of the condition in the animal are identical to those of the human condition. Isomorphic models display similar symptoms, but the condition is not provoked by the same events as the human condition. Partial models do not attempt to model the entire condition, but focus only on limited aspects. Models can be further classified into spontaneous, induced, negative and \"orphan\" models. Uncritical extrapolation of animal findings to the human condition may lead to unreliable or even dangerous conclusions. Extrapolation tends to be most reliable when a plurispecies approach is taken, and when differences in metabolic patterns and speed as well as several other confounding variables are taken into account. Animal models have been crucial to neurological and psychiatric research, even though the search for valid models has been difficult in these fields because of the differences in brain structure and function between humans and other species.",

Wesentlich war vielmehr der Wunsch nach Bestatigung des eigenen Wertes und der eigenen physischen Attraktivitat, der Wunsch, eigenen Defiziten oder erlebter Einsamkeit zu entkommen, die Suche nach Verbundenheit und Intimitat, Verliebtheit oder die Tendenz, das Risiko als Vergnugen am Verbotenen umzudefinieren und gegen etablierte Strukturen zu rebellieren. – In all diesen Fallen wurde die Sorge um die eigene Gesundheit und Unversehrtheit wahrend des ungeschutzten Analverkehrs ausgeblendet.

      "title": "Physiologic Assessment of Sexual Response in Women: The Unfulfilled Promise",
      "abstract": "With the exception of work by Semmens (1979), the clinical value of physiologic measures of female sexual response has not been demonstrated; it almost seems that controlled attempts to apply measures of vaginal muscular tone or blood flow to clinical settings has been jinxed. Hence, this author takes issue with Hatch (1980), who gives the impression that physiologic measures can now be used in clinical applications. The reasons for failure in sex therapy or biofeedback are uncertain, but it may be useful to speculate briefly. Sexual arousal in women is too personal a phenomenon to be objectively assessed during waking states in an \"artificial\" laboratory context. Orgasmic response is not related to genital muscle tone, but to other unknown anatomic, learning-history, and psychological components. The circumstances under which there is agreement between physiologic and either psychometric or self-reports of arousal or pleasure are complex and interactive. Therefore, physiologic measures of female sexual response may not reflect the subjective experience of women and, taken alone, may be misleading. This conclusion should not surprise anyone, for human beings are truly a \"cognitive\" species with representational imagery and language. Sexuality is very much \"in the frontal lobes,\" and what we perceive eroticism to mean in a given context is probably much more important than the physiologic and behavioral aspects of actual sexual expression. Despite these problems of employing physiologic measures of female response in clinical settings, research into more basic issues has been quite profitable and heuristic. For example, several common assumptions about female sexuality are now open to question: women are more arousable just prior to menses; Kegel exercises improve orgasm consistency; sex therapy for inhibited arousal and desire is efficacious; there is usually agreement between the physiologic intensity of sexual response and a patient's subjective estimate of that intensity. On the other hand, there is evidence that vaginal engorgement in women remains at a high level after an initial orgasm, thus setting the physiologic stage for consecutive orgasmic responses; sexual arousal can be measured physiologically with acceptable degrees of reliability and specificity; muscle contractions in women during orgasm can be measured with high levels of precision; women respond to direct representations of erotic activity much the way men do; there are cortical \"physiologic\" signatures of orgasmic response in men and women. Obviously, a number of clinical research issues in female sexuality can now be investigated with physiologic measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Critical or sensitive periods in the life of an organism during which certain experiences or conditions may exert disproportionate influence (either for harm or benefit) on long-term developmental outcomes have been the subject of investigation for over a century. This chapter reviews research in the context of the development of social preferences and sensory systems, with a summary of the criteria for defining such a period and the evidence necessary to establish its existence. The notion of nutritional programming, central to the Barker/Developmental Origins hypotheses of health and disease, represents a variant of the critical/sensitive period concept. It is implicit in these hypotheses that the fetal period is a time during which metabolic and physiological systems are malleable and thus susceptible to either insult or enhancement by nutrient intake. Evidence for critical/sensitive periods or nutritional programming requires a systematic manipulation of the age at which nutritional conditions or supplements are implemented. While common in research using animal models, the approach is difficult to establish in epidemiological studies and virtually nonexistent in human clinical trials. Future work seeking to establish definitive evidence for critical/sensitive periods or programming may be advanced by harmonized outcome measures in experimental trials across which the timing, duration, and dose of nutrients is varied.",

Purely mechanical disorders of seminal deposition due to anatomy are to be differentiated from functional libido and orgasmic disorders, from ejaculation problems or the inability to achieve or maintain erections. While pure orgasmic disturbances are almost in all cases due to psychological or psychiatric causes, libido and erectile dysfunction may also have hormonal causes and thus be symptoms of androgen deficiency. Additional clinical symptoms of hypogonadism or objectifiable findings such as testicular atrophy, changes in secondary sexual characteristics, or ejaculate volume allow the organic genesis to be identified in pronounced cases, while in other cases the corresponding indications must be actively sought. Thus, while functional orgasmic and libido disorders are the domain of psychological psychiatric or endocrinological therapeutic approaches, this chapter deals primarily with disorders of seminal deposition and functionally or organically caused disorders of cohabitation.",

Erectile and orgastic spectatoring were frequent after stroke and were in the males significantly associated. Retarded ejaculation occurred for no males before but for 15% after the stroke. Marked decreases in different kinds of caressive behaviour were followed by discontentment and up to and about half the subjects felt that sexual partnership responsiveness had deteriorated. After the stroke the commonly occurring reduction in general sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with symptoms of increased sexual dysfunction, disturbed partnership responsiveness and reduced sexual fulfilment. The high prevalence of sexual maladjustment in stroke victims appears mostly to be psychogenic. Important precipitating factors are performance orientation and sexual stigmatism. Moreover, lack of sexual information and counselling may contribute to deterioration of partnership sexuality.",

We highlight how fantasies participate in the processes of unbecoming and becoming to disrupt the existing gendered boundaries/subjectivities and create new possibilities of being. The market objects, including the mundane and the excess, are operating in the becoming/unbecoming, facilitating temporal gender transformations, while at the same time creating identity residues that persist between the many gendered bodily experiences (male, female or hybrid) permeating time and space. In particular, we highlight how these identity residues can be experienced as pleasurable or risky if not managed carefully, contributing to an enhanced understanding of the affective state of in-between gender and how it intersects with gendered market objects and rituals.",

On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other. Counselling, behaviour therapy and treatment with sexual hormones can help to solve the problems.",

      "abstract": "With diet and exercise bodies are routinely shaped and sculpted to adhere not only to standards of health and medicine but also, and perhaps more regularly, to sociocultural appearance norms. Likewise, we can just as routinely observe how bodies are subject to the regimented norms of posture, somatic rules for how they smell, and both written and unwritten rubrics of exposure—especially how much flesh may be revealed, under what circumstances, and with whom. Bodies are clothed with garments, both visible and veiled, that simultaneously conceal as much as they expressively accentuate. Everywhere, and at all times, bodies are actively inscribed with any one or more of the physical markers of powerful social institutions including age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and religion. Bodies are habitually maintained, and chiefly not for functional but aesthetic qualities in acts including the various means of growing hair in some parts of the body while, elsewhere, cutting, shaving, plucking, or chemically removing it. Similarly, other body maintenance regimens include things such as altering the color and texture of hair, skin, eyes, finger or toe nails. Teeth are straightened, whitened, polished, and replaced if necessary. Bodies are stylized with piercings, tattoos, hairstyles, and procedures for tanning, bleaching, and painting. Bodies are perpetually on display although, as we learn through the course of socialization, one must be cautious about whose bodies we gaze upon, where specifically we affix that gaze, for how long, and at what proximity. In all of these ways and a multitude of others, the body is clearly the site of enormous expressive and impressive appearance management as well as a focal point for significant ritual activity—two dynamics that are, without question, foremost to dramaturgical analysis.",

      "abstract": "The frequent interaction and synergy between sexual arousal and sexual desire occuring during a sexual experience explains the difficulty in disentagling these two phenomena in the human sexual response. Sexual desire is defined as a goal-directed motivational state integrating the other in one's personal sphere on the basis of intentionality, rather than by instinct only. Sexual arousal includes physical manifestations and subjective perception of excitement. Interest in sexual arousal has engendered a growing body of research concerning its nature and function as well as the biological basis of the mechanisms sustaining it. Recent functional imaging has played a key role in seeking to isolate brain regions specific to sexual arousal. This field may represent a new challenge for social neuroscience.",

      "title": "Missing Pieces, Repetitive Practices",
      "abstract": "The sexual abuse and exploitation of children is a serious problem. Adult sexual predators often use strategies known as grooming to entice their victims. These include targeting particularly vulnerable youth, gift giving, and systematically engaging in desensitizing sexual behaviors. Less commonly discussed is the notion of institutional grooming, the practice of strategically placing themselves in positions of public trust where they have access to children yet appear beyond reproach. Once situated, they can abuse children for decades without deterrence in spite of the fact that individuals around them may be aware–or partially aware–of their behavior. This article examines three cases, one involving a priest, another a football coach, and the third a pediatrician and considers the institutional practices and cultures that permit (or potentially permit) abuse and exploitation to flourish. Among other things it finds: confidentiality mandates and other codes of silence and secrecy impede information sharing; departmental or programmatic silos exist each with their own independent and competing agendas; confused reporting lines within the institution often end in the hands of powerful individuals who have an interest in non-disclosure; barriers exist to investing within the institution and reporting outside the institution often including mistrust and disempowerment of law enforcement and child protective services; extreme power differences exist between and among victims, predators, reporters, and other institutional players; and finally, intense loyalties personal, professional, and institutional are present. These factors produce institutional cultures that protect pedophiles and conspire against their vulnerable, individual, child victims.",

      "abstract": "A surprising number of men report a lack of sexual desire, with conservative estimates ranging between 15 and 25% of adult males. Statistics do not adequately convey the intricacies of male sexual desire; it is a complex construct, encompassing interest, arousal and motivation for initiating or responding to sexual cues for dyadic or solitary sexual behaviors. A range of etiological factors are implicated in this dysfunction, and relational conflict and stress are high among them. Anger and resentment for one’s partner can result in absent desire for the partner, with sexual desire still intact for other sexual outlets (other partners, masturbation, pornography). Sexual secrets are therefore important to consider as well as shame about the true nature of one’s sexual desires. Systemic sex therapy, with its emphasis on identifying and addressing a wide range of etiological factors while also focusing on behavioral interventions to improve desire, is an effective treatment option for men suffering low desire in the context of an ongoing relationship.",

The terms proposed are (1) sex: to refer to the biological function; (2) biologically sex-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally biologically related to being male or female; (3) gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally linked with maleness or femaleness but are culturally based as opposed to biologically based; (4) sex- and gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally related to both a biological component and a cultural component; and (5) sex-correlated: to refer to traits or conditions that are related to being male or female without asserting a causal relation to either biology or culture (because we do not wish to make such an assertion or cannot do so confidently). It is hoped that adopting a terminological standard will reduce the confusion resulting from nonspecific language use.",

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Sexual abuse is defined as use of child or adolescent by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse can be in the form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10-40%. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5-15% of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition.",

The type of male initiation to be considered in this chapter consists of a series of rites during which the initiate is transformed from a genderless child to an adult male. Ritual circumcision begins the sequence, followed by a period of exclusion from domestic life, and completed by a ceremony of reentry into the domestic and reproductive cycle. The couvade, sometimes termed “male childbed” because of the husband's involvement in the birth process, is a set of supernaturalistic observances on the part of the father of a newborn or to-be-born child. The observances in their intensive form (the focus of interest in this paper) require the father to deviate significantly from normal activities (Munroe, Munroe, and Whiting 1973).",

The term \"adolescence\" is applied to the period of psychosocial development from childhood to adulthood that corresponds to chronologic ages 10 or 12 to 21 years. Adolescent pregnancy has different implications for the 18- or 19-year-old high school graduate who is married or planning marriage than for the 13-or 14-year-old middle school student who may be beginning the process of adolescence. Although recognizing this broad spectrum, the Committee on Adolescence has chosen the term \"adolescent pregnancy\" for this and related statements. Our primary concern is the individual in early to middle adolescence (younger than the age of 18 years) who is biologically and/or psychosocially immature, and for whom pregnancy is, often unplanned, if not unwanted. Explanations for the high prevalence have ranged from inadequate sex education to sexual promiscuity. In this statement current research data will be reviewed and relevant information will be provided so that pediatricians and others responsible for the health care of adolescents can appreciate the implications and consequences of adolescent sexual activity and early childbearing. SEXUAL ACTIVITY The current problems resulting from teenage pregnancy cannot be appreciated fully without understanding adolescent sexual behavior and the secular changes that have taken place.",

      "title": "Nonconsensual Insemination: Battery",
      "abstract": "Nonconsensual insemination is a battery. It may be a simple battery, aggravated battery, or a sexual battery. Without having received unequivocal, expressed consent, a man who ejaculates inside of an intimate partner commits nonconsensual insemination, which is a battery. Expressed consent is required at each stage of sexual activity. Since insemination, i.e. ejaculating inside a woman, is not intrinsic to having unprotected sex for women or ejaculation for men, then it is an additional sex act that requires expressed consent. Arguments that require victims to use condoms as the best or only means for avoiding nonconsensual insemination amount to victim-blaming. The transmission of disease through nonconsensual ejaculation is specifically prohibited by most states. Unwanted pregnancy that results from sexual battery is as an aggravating factor in many states. The government's demonstrated interest in preventing unwilling contact that causes harm, supports the proposition that reproductive coercion or reckless nonconsensual insemination should be routinely prosecuted. Prosecution should be acknowledged, socially and politically, as one way to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. The principles of therapeutic justice and the current trend to move away from incarceration for nonviolent offenses suggest that this crime should be met with court ordered education, counseling, and perhaps, public shaming (limited/temporary use of sex offender registries), but not incarceration in most instances.",

      "title": "Guest Editorial. Urinary Incontinence: Bridging the Gender Gap",
      "abstract": "Unlike other activities of daily living, such as ambulation and eating, bladder control is often not perceived as a function critical to physiological survival. However, continence is a major marker of social function and acceptability in all cultures, regardless of anthropological origins. Consequently, patients and caregivers may be more inclined to consider urine incontinence more of a social embarrassment than a physical disease. Likewise, some health professionals diminish the significance of urinary incontinence in comparison with other activities of daily living, by incorrectly describing it as a nonhierarchical index of functional status. Over the past decade, urinary incontinence, along with other diseases, such as erectile dysfunction and andropause, that border on genital function and sexuality, has received increasing public attention (1,2). However, this campaign of health awareness is frequently hijacked by product commercials that focus on curative pharmacological therapy or the use of aids and appliances to achieve a state of social continence. Unfortunately, among health professionals, the situation may be even more dire. Urinary incontinence, one of the great sleeping giants of geriatrics, continues to remain just that—a formidable obstacle in our path that may cause us to stumble as we age. This is supported by the volume of research highlighting the morbid consequences of urinary incontinence, and the relative paucity of complementary research offering effective intervention strategies. Urinary incontinence affects 15%–35% of communitydwelling older adults and 50% of nursing home residents (3,4). The inclusion of persons with ‘‘dependent continence’’—continence preserved only as a result of assistance from staff or caregivers—increases the prevalence of incontinence in the nursing home by at least an additional 10% (5). Annually, more than $3 billion are spent on the management of incontinence in long-term care facilities. However, the cost of incontinence extends way beyond economic considerations, as the psychological impact of incontinence is often far reaching and socially devastating. Urinary incontinence frequently exerts enormous psychosocial strain on the caregiver, family members, and social network, which in several cases far exceeds the distress experienced by the patient (6). At first glance, the findings of Nuotio and colleagues, in this issue of the Journal, may appear to be yet another addition to the extensive literature on incontinence morbidity (7). However, their study is one of the few that shows a refreshing departure from the monotonous reiteration of the medical complications of incontinence. Nuotio and colleagues establish an independent link between urinary incontinence in men and institutionalization. The association was maintained even after correction for age, comorbidity, and living arrangements. This clear-cut and convincing gender bias mandates close scrutiny of psychosocial and cultural factors if we are to succeed in unraveling the linkage between incontinence and institutionalization. Clearly, the gender bias demonstrated in Nuotio’s study is more likely a reflection of complex sociocultural themes than genetic variations in sex chromosomes. However, the issue of gender differences remains relatively unexplored in the geriatric literature, as most earlier studies were restricted to the examination of single-sex cohorts (8,9). Traditionally, basic tenets of geriatric medicine are firmly grounded in logic and well-worn, but nevertheless proven, cliches that highlight the benefits of a common-sense approach. It is therefore surprising that, in spite of the distinct anatomical differences in external genitalia between men and women, the effect of gender on urinary incontinence in older adults remains relatively ignored. This tendency is rendered even more peculiar by the fact that gender is a primary and fundamental consideration in evaluating urinary incontinence during childhood, the other extreme of life. Maggi and colleagues, in an earlier issue of the Journal, identified an association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson’s disease, hip fracture, and urinary incontinence in women (10). Introspective review of these findings support the hypothesis that the greater physical effort required by females in preparing for micturition may increase the risk of incontinence in women with restricted mobility or reduced exercise tolerance. In contrast, men require relatively less mechanical effort and minimal change in posture during micturition,",

      "title": "Spontaneous pregnancy and unexplained infertility: A gift with many whys",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nInfertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The dualism between the so-called “Psychogenic hypothesis” and the hypothesis of “Psychological consequences of infertility” has been solved with the proposal of an interactive and bidirectional relationship between infertility and psychosocial diseases.[1] Infertility itself can cause severe stress on both partners and start a vicious cycle resulting in the decreasing likelihood of pregnancy and even of treatment success. The infertility treatment could be responsible for a major impairment of the sex life because it frequently digs into the intimacy of the couple. Moreover the “emotional rollercoaster” related to the treatment is felt, especially by the women, to be extremely mentally stressful. Sexual intercourse can lose its spontaneity because it is aimed at “baby-making” and it is strictly restricted to “fertile” days. Sexuality can be therefore deprived of its recreative and erotic value and subordinated to the direct goal of pregnancy. Furthermore, sexual intercourse may be increasingly associated with a sense of failure, affecting even the patient's image of his/her own body. According to a recent meta-analysis, sexual disorders – depending on both infertility itself and infertility diagnosis and treatment – are common in infertile couples, with women more affected than men.[2]\r\n\r\nLittle is known about spontaneous pregnancy after infertility therapy either successful or failed. Couples dealing with long-term involuntary childlessness usually consider in-vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments as a final option but a relative high incidence of treatment-independent pregnancies especially in couples with unexplained infertility is frequently reported. Hennely et al., analyzed the spontaneous conception rate after a successful IVF cycle. In this retrospective study 106 of 513 (20.7%) couples obtained a spontaneous pregnancy two years after Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) birth success.[3] The likelihood of spontaneous conception was higher in younger women and was strongly connected to the duration of infertility. Indeed, women who have been infertile for a shorter period more likely achieved a spontaneous pregnancy. In a recent study,[4] 2134 couples were retrospectively analyzed in order to estimate the frequency of spontaneous pregnancies among couples previously treated by IVF. The spontaneous pregnancy rate was 17% among couples who previously achieved pregnancy through ART and 24% among couples who conceived spontaneously after unsuccessful medical treatment. Among both groups, almost 60% of the spontaneous pregnancies occurred two to three years after the last IVF transfer. The proportion of spontaneous pregnancies was higher in couples with unexplained infertility, suggesting a better fertility prognosis compared with couples whose infertility is of known origin. Spontaneous conception in couples with unexplained infertility could be related either to the stress relief after the decision to abandon the therapy or to the placebo effect after being placed in the waiting list before starting the treatment. Treatment-independent pregnancies occur sometimes after a successful ART procedure or after adoption, suggesting the important impact of psychological factors on fertility.\r\n\r\nNevertheless spontaneous pregnancy in couples diagnosed with unexplained infertility remains nowadays a mysterious event. Many questions are still unanswered. Is spontaneous conception connected to a previous ovarian stimulation, necessary in some IVF cycles? Could the previous pregnancy be responsible for endocrine changes that increase the reproductive potential? Or is it mainly related to the stress relief that undoubtedly occurs after achieving parenthood? A lot of work in that direction needs to be done. It remains however important to remind to every couple starting an infertility treatment that spontaneous conception before, during or after ART-procedures has to be taken into account!",

The main problem is that there are no criminal provisions governing incest that are committed consensual in adulthood, so studies are needed to provide solutions in resolving cases that occur in the future. The results of this study are that the Criminal Code only regulates acts of sexual immorality against biological children, stepchildren, adopted children or children who are in their care with an element of coercion but does not regulate consensual sexual relations (incest) that is committed consensual at an adult age which has implications for law enforcement difficulties if this case happened. The regulation in the future is to stipulate incest which is done voluntarily at the age of adulthood as a crime.

      "abstract": "Research on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) has increased in the last decade; however, there is no consensus about the scope and definition of CSREs. To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

Prostitution therefore straddles two quite different symbolic domains. Since these domains are highly gendered, the female prostitute has long represented a troubling figure, disrupting what are traditionally deemed to be natural gender binaries (active/passive, public/private, etc.), and stigmatized as unnatural, immoral, and polluting. Yet prostitution is often simultaneously viewed as an inevitable feature of all human societies, for it is held to meet the supposedly powerful and biologically given sexual impulses of men. Thus it is sometimes described as a “necessary evil” and considered to protect the virtue of “good” girls and women by “soaking up” excess male sexual urges which would otherwise lead to rape and marital breakdown.",

This diagnosis is intended to include only individuals who experience dissatisfaction with their low levels of sexual desire. Women with this condition will often report that they \"want to want\" more sex, while women with low levels of sexual desire that do not meet HSDD criteria will indicate no bother or concerns with the frequency of their sexual desire. The subjective experience of distress caused by low desire is a critical component of the diagnosis of HSDD because many individuals are not alarmed by low levels of sexual desire. Indeed, an epidemiological study conducted in Australia demonstrated that 32% of women who are 20–70 years old report low sexual desire, but only 16% report distress caused by the low sexual desire [2].",

The widespread belief that the sexual abuse of boys is relatively uncommon means that male survivors will often minimise the effect the sexual abuse which they have suffered has had on them. The cultural and social dynamics that are at work in our society ensure that men develop a rigid and potentially unstable masculine identity that is buttressed at the expense of dehumanizing women, particularly denying and repressing their relationship to their mothers, their most important first attachment relationship. Fantasy can become a focus for the survivor's rage at being helpless and powerless when the abuse took place. Some of the men may not have concerns either around fantasies and/or about acting them out. They may simply internalize their experience and repress or split it off.",

A zygote is produced when the sperm of a male and the egg of a female are united, and around nine months later a baby is born. Most often in this process, though not always, a man and a woman have sexual intercourse, the woman conceives, and the conception results in a live birth. Even though the production of a child is a biological process, the various activities and events that lead to the act of sexual intercourse and, later, to giving birth are affected by the social, economic, cultural, and psychological characteristics of the woman and the man, as well as by the environment in which they live. The key to this seeming paradox is that engaging in intercourse, conceiving, and giving birth are themselves behaviors that are influenced by other factors, most of them social and cultural. So while we have no influence at all with regard to the family and parents we receive when we are born, we do have a significant influence on our own fertility, that is, whether or not we produce children, and if so, the number and timing of the children produced. That is, whether we decide to engage in sexual intercourse, whether this intercourse results in a conception, and whether a live birth is the outcome are all driven largely by social and cultural considerations.",

Much of the broader association between psychopathy and offending of all types including sexual deviance relates to psychopathy's general Antagonism. Disproportionately attributing sexual offending to psychopathy belies the many pathways into sexual offending, which is itself a very broad criminological classification, ranging from hands-off, remote offenses to hands-on/contact offenses (rape and sexual assault). Moreover, some aspects of psychopathy are more associated with sexual offending than others; the core traits (affective and interpersonal) are less strongly associated than behavioral and criminal lifestyle facets. Also, concurrent sexual deviation is a key risk-increasing factor, as are emotional–neurotic elements emerging from with secondary psychopathy such as obsessionality and compulsivity.",

Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

Abuse cuts across all social categories and classes. It occurs in well-educated high-income areas and in low-income working-class areas; it happens in all races and religions. It can occur in families, extended families, in neighbour hoods, schools, churches, and community groups. Both men and women can be abusive and it can occur in virtually all age groups.

      "title": "Sex Offenders and the Free Exercise of Religion",
      "abstract": "In a variety of ways, sex offenders in the United States find themselves in a difficult position. One of the lesser-known ways relates to the free exercise of religion. Sometimes by categorical statute, and sometimes by individualized parole, probation, or supervised-release condition, sex offenders can find themselves legally barred from places where children are present (or likely to be present). Because children are usually present at religious services, sex offenders can find themselves unable to attend them altogether. And this hardship has a bit of irony in it too. Back in prison, sex offenders could worship freely with others; now ostensibly free, they can no longer do so. \r\n\r\nThis simple problem has real scope—tens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of people barred from essentially all religious services, sometimes for decades, sometimes for life. Moreover, these prohibitions are often vague and overbroad—and so restrictive that low-level administrators (like sheriffs and probation officers) are often pushed into softening or waiving them. But this ends up creating a kind of licensing scheme, whereby low-level government officials make—on their own, without any formal criteria—ad-hoc and practically unreviewable decisions about who gets to go to church and under what conditions. Risks of selective enforcement, discrimination, and abuse are obvious.\r\n\r\nThese rules have come into being as if concerns about the free exercise of religion have no weight at all. But this is not the case. And, in fact, a robust body of law protects the free exercise of religion, requiring exemptions from religiously burdensome laws. Now this does not mean that sex offenders should be universally exempt from any and all restrictions regarding church attendance. There are probably some people who pose such a threat to children that they should be kept away from churches. Courts will have to answer tricky questions—who should be barred, who should decide who is barred, and on what criteria?—that require nuanced and elaborate answers. Yet informed by analogies from other areas of law (like freedom of speech) where courts have wrestled with similar issues, this Article offers some recommendations that are analytically rigorous, practically realizable, and judicially manageable.",

      "abstract": "L'impotenza funzionale è un caso della disfunzione sessuale che si caratterizza di una e iologia complicata. Sotto questo aspetto la malattia fa oggetto della ricerca accurata degli biologie medici. Per ragioni della importanza al matrimonio l'impotenza è anche l'oggetto delle ricerche canoniche. Un concetto canonico della impotenza funzionale è piu stretto che lo medico. Tre elementi di atto sessuale fanno il criterio che distingue le nozioni canoniche e mediche, cio è: erectio membirs virili, penetratio in vagine et eiaculatio seminis. Incapacità per assumere di qualsiasi elemento dell'atto matrimoniale rende impossibile una realizzazione l'unità e la procreazione nel matrimonio. Gli disfunzioni di provar piacere come eiaculatio praematura sia retardata sia – presso le donne – frigiditas non fanno l'impotenza funzionale nel senso di impedimento matrimoniale. Solo carentia erecitonis, eiaculatio praecox, sia vaginismus primitivus sono i casi dell'impotenza funzionale, che potrebbero essere un impedimento canonico. Soltanto impotenza precedente e perpetua provoca invalidità del matrimonio per ragione dell'essere impedimentum dirimens (kan. 1084 §1). II carattere relativo del male non è importante per validità del patto matrimoniale. Nella canonistica ci sono due significative distinzione nell'etiologia di impotenza; il piu importante sembra divisione sull'impotenza organica e funzionale (Marucci, Sebot, Bernrde z Cantn, Vitali, Berlingo, Pompedda) e poi c' è l'altra sull'impotenza organica, funzionale e psichica (Vela, Aznar Gil). Il distinzione riguarda i fattori della causa della disfunzione. Il piu spesso qeusta divergenza consegue dal diversa classificazione delle cause funzionali; mentre alcuni considerano le disfunzioni neurologiche che vanno dalla parte organica dell'uomo, altri sembrano attribuirle alla parte psichica. La distinzione, che segue, pare di essere la soluzione proprio della questa differenza terminologica: impotenza può risultare di cause organiche e delle cause funzionale di tipo fisiologicho sia tipopsichico. L' impotenza funzionale deve essere considerata come la disfunzione di organi sessuali, che viene dalla disturbazione del centrale sistemo nervoso, mentre l'impotenza funzionale tipo psichico comprende come la disfunzione, che viene dalle cause di natura psichica (timori, traume psichiche, ripugnanza). &nbsp",

A la luz de tres vinetas clinicas, el articulo discute el concepto de destructividad, tanto de forma general como especifica, en situaciones de abuso sexual, para proponer, finalmente, algunos puntos de atencion en torno al habla del nino durante el cuidado. Cabe senalar que el nino, independientemente de que hable o no, a menudo sigue estando psicotraumatizado. La destructividad se refiere a la naturaleza destructiva de un elemento vivo o no vivo y, mas generalmente, a la capacidad de destruir. En relacion con este concepto, podemos observar, en general, los llamados factores de gravedad y otros llamados factores de proteccion que pueden coexistir. Si los primeros son mas graves, hay una alta probabilidad de que los sintomas sean incapacitantes y duraderos, observando que pueden empeorar con el tiempo o aparecer de forma retardada. Si los factores de proteccion son significativos, entonces es mas probable que el nino experimente un trauma leve y una curacion mas o menos rapida.",

      "title": "Introduction Into the Diagnostics and Treatment of Premature Ejaculation: Sexuality Has Many Facets",
      "abstract": "This interesting article leaves many questions unanswered. Even though meaningful long-term studies are lacking, the authors neither discussed the course of premature ejaculation between individuals and in the same individual nor whether symptoms are due to a particular sexual partner or to the man’s form of the day. Etiologically, distress or particular personality traits were left out of the discussion, as were aspects of whether premature ejaculation is the cause or effect of a partner interaction that may be problematic only at second glance, whether the symptoms occur regularly, or whether the same man also has these problems while masturbating. And what about the influence of circumcision? It seems that the regions with a reportedly high prevalence of premature ejaculation – such as South America and Asia – represent typical macho cultures, rather than focusing on the female orgasm in particular, as the authors claim.\r\n\r\nIf the high prevalence of 30% worldwide (1) is true then this could be due to a physiological variant to the norm. To suggest that this has the status of an illness – presumably in order to have reasons for (psycho)therapeutic or pharmacological interventions, financed by the health insurance companies – is something that should be subject to critical questioning (2). authors do not mention that human sexuality may have many more facets and be much more subtle (3) than the actual act of intercourse would reflect. From this perspective, in many men, the subjective experience of illness – which may well be zeitgeist-oriented and depend on their individual disposition – might even be increased. However, a man’s procreative ability does not seem to be appreciably affected by premature ejaculation. Further, at a time of high global promiscuity, premature ejaculation may be an advantage in terms of procreative strategy, pointedly formulated as in the tried and tested principle: The early bird catches the worm.",

As will be discussed, certain lesions are highly specific for sexual abuse while others may be nonspecific or more consistent with a medical disorder or accidental injury. It is important to remember that the vast majority of children disclosing sexual abuse do not have physical evidence of injury or infection on examination. Sexual abuse describes involvement of children and adolescents in developmentally inappropriate sexual activities to which they are unable to consent and which they cannot comprehend.

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae – a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member’s experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

Dieser stark eingeschränkte Gebrauch dieses Begriffs hat sich leider in der Umgangssprache durchgesetzt. Da der Koitus die einzige Form des Geschlechtsverkehrs ist, die zur Zeugung von Kindern führt, wurde diesem in unserer Kultur lange Zeit ein hoher Stellenwert zugemessen. In der jüdischen und christlichen Tradition sind Sexualität und Fortpflanzung untrennbar miteinander verbunden. Jede sexuelle Handlung, die nicht zu einer Schwangerschaft führte, wurde als sündig verurteilt und abgelehnt bis hin zur gesetzlichen Bestrafung. Statistisch ist der Koitus sicher die verbreiteste Form sexuellen Kontaktes, er ist jedoch keinesfalls die einzige. Tatsächlich ist er für viele Männer und Frauen nicht einmal die bevorzugte Form des Sexualkontaktes. Darüber hinaus gibt es Menschen, die aufgrund körperlicher Gebrechen nicht in der Lage sind, einen Koitus durchzuführen. Dennoch unterhalten sie erfüllte sexuelle Beziehungen. Es besteht kein Zweifel daran, daß die ständige Überbewertung von Penis und Scheide bei gleichzeitiger Vernachlässigung anderer erogener Zonen des Körpers zur sinnlichen Abstumpfung führt.",

      "abstract": "The issue of body and embodiment bears strong roots in feminist theories, philosophy, gender studies, women’s studies and men’s studies. According to some previous publications, the impact of patriarchal power structures and hegemonic (heterosexual) masculinity on gender roles, sexuality, and the (social) position of women and minorities can also be construed in connection with (body) perception and embodiment.The experience of one's “sex” as a purely biological phenomenon is influenced by norms and values of parents, relatives and institutional systems from a very young age, and is thus exposed to the effects of the social and cultural environment. Contrasting the experience of manhood and womanhood, masculine (activity, aggression, resilience) and feminine (passivity, fragility) attributes, male (strong) and female (delicate) bodies is an important tool in creating, justifying, and maintaining gender dichotomies and power relations. Some previous studies on the body and the embodiment of gender also highlight that queer culture, transsexuality, and other marginalized groups (ethnic minorities, people with disabilities) questions the legitimacy of this gender binarity.The aim of the present study is to investigate the presence of embodiment theory in gender studies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The sexual behaviour of sexually experienced Culicoides melleus males has been investigated. Immediately after completing a prior copulation, the male almost invariably makes only brief temporary union of the genitalia with a previously mated female before releasing his hold. Release is equally frequent whether the female be the male's original mate or the original mate of another male. In contrast, recently mated males frequently complete copulation at the first attempt with young virgin females, and virgin males almost invariably complete with recently mated females. The behaviour of sexually experienced individuals was found to depend on male sensitivity (acquired during copulation) to female defensive grooming before and after establishment of genital union. Defensive grooming provides the stimulus to which the sensitive male responds by releasing the female. Male sensitivity to the stimulus declines with passage of time since his last copulation.",

      "abstract": "Self-enhancement and self-protection are constrained by reality. But to what extent? Broader constraints, often considered powerful, such as East-Asian culture, religion, mind-body practices, and prison environments are not particularly effective deterrents. Narrower constraints, also considered powerful, such as self-reflection and mnemic neglect, are not very helpful either. Deliberate and systematic laboratory efforts, both at the intrapersonal level (e.g., explanatory introspection, salience of one's faults) and the interpersonal level (e.g., accountability, relationship closeness), can boast success in constraining self-enhancement and self-protection strivings, but the success is mixed, difficult to implement, and probably short-lived. The doggedness (potency and prevalence) of self-enhancement and self-protection are due to the functions or social benefits with which they are associated or confer: psychological health, goal pursuit and attainment, leadership election, and sexual selection. These functions are traceable to our species' evolutionary past.",

Research now demonstrates that typically such abuse goes on for decades, is frequently multi-generational and almost inevitably the father (or step-father) is part of some sort of organized abuse network. Victims of such abuse experience extreme fear and shame, are highly dissociative, highly conditioned, and in keeping with an enduring extreme attachment to their primary abuser typically feel fused with their father and indeed do not experience themselves as owning their own body. Invariably the father and other abusers are represented in their psyche in the form of dissociative identity states. This chapter highlights the enduring attachment to the father, the early manipulation of sexual responses and the ways in which a child abused from a very early age remains very controlled by the father with ongoing polymorphous extreme (usually sadistic) sexual abuse.",

In its fullest form, female concealment of cycle-phase fertility has typically been thought to require three features. First, a concealing female does not “know,” that is, perceive, discriminate, or respond to, her own peak fertility in the estrous/menstrual cycle. Hence, she exhibits no variation in sexual motivation across the cycle. Second, and relatedly, female sexual behavior has become independent of variations in female reproductive-cycle hormonal inKuences. That is, endocrine changes across the cycle do not signi0cantly produce variation in female sexual motivation. Third, female morphological, behavioral, or olfactory signals of peak fertility in the estrous/menstrual cycle are greatly reduced or altogether absent. Hence, males cannot discriminate female peak fertility in the cycle.",

      "title": "[Psychosociology of the demand for abortion].",
      "abstract": "3 preliminary observations are relevant to an analysis of the psychosociology of abortion. All pregnancies, regardless of the outcome, are meaningful for the woman and/or the couple. On the other hand, the debate for or against abortion is meaningless to the extent that most women seeking abortions are to some degree \"against\" abortion. Finally, beyond a certain point the use of contraception and the demand for abortion are not related, as shown by the stability of abortion rates in France over the past 20 years during which rates of contraceptive usage changed greatly and by the high level of contraceptive information among women seeking repeat abortions. In the psychic realm, being pregnant is positive if only as a indication of the power to become pregnant. It is known that women suffering a recent loss are more likely to become pregnant. PRegnancy under circumstances of loss or mourning signifies that something other than death or loss is possible. The idea of pregnancy as a compensation for loss can refer to a range of situations such as death of a close relative, end of a union, divorce, unemployment, or educational or professional failure, to name a few. The unconscious utilization of pregnancy as a proof of power can be repeated each time doubt arises as to the reality of this power. Not pregnancy, but bringing a child into the world is what is impossible in voluntary pregnancy termination. Abortion is chosen because it allows the mother or the couple to avoid an investment for which they are unprepared. Becoming a mother means to stop being a child and also forces an encounter with the images of one's own parents internalized during childhood. Such images are not always good, which caused problems in the psychic work of identification with the parent that accompanies childbirth. Choosing to have a child and joining the chain of generations is impossible for some persons, because the filiation is too difficult or the parental images are too negative. Abortions, like the occurrence of the pregnancies that lead to them, are always meaningful, although their significance may not be consciously grasped by the woman. On the societal level, abortion may signal resistance to the medicalization and perhaps politicization of sexuality. The perceived high economic cost of children and desire to provide them with abundance may be other factors in the demand for abortion. To some degree children are now valued by society primarily as a potential market. Study of the origins of abortion is not specific, but fundamental to an understanding of human reproduction in general.",

Discrimination against LGBTI persons could be based on sexual orientation (to whom someone is attracted); gender identity (how people define themselves, irrespective of biological sex), gender expression (how gender is expressed, through clothing, hair, or make-up), or sex characteristics (for example, genitals, chromosomes, reproductive organs, or hormone levels). The UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has observed that LGBTI persons are especially vulnerable to extrajudicial killings. The prohibition on executing LGBTI persons on the basis of their gender or sexual identity is not only a customary rule, but it is also a peremptory norm of international law.",

      "title": "Re: Sexual Harassment",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is widespread and prolific across the human race, mostly of females by males. It is a spectrum, from the worst of criminal behaviour (e.g. rape and murder of strangers, of women and girls) to what might be considered harmless playful banter between the sexes from later childhood and ever after. It does not occur in infancy, and appears to begin as a ‘learned’ phenomenon from later childhood. In his editorial, Isaacs considers sexual harassment occurring of women within our own profession, recognising that almost all examples of sexual harassment involve bullying, abuse of power and greater physical strength by males, often leading to emotional and/or physical harms.1 He does not mention the biological differences between the sexes.1 While sexual harassment is apparently learned, not innate, pre-pubertal boys and men are more aggressive than females, have more accidents and commit more violent crimes. While biological differences make males more often the initiators of sexual advances, they are no excuse for predatory or inappropriate behaviour, but any improvements will need to take these differences into account. Isaacs does not mention the importance of co-factors,1 the worst of which is alcohol. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is relevant in both promoting and facilitating abuse, and any solution will need to take alcohol into account. Isaacs advocates greater fight-back by women and better behaviour by men.1 In truth, we really do not know what to do to prevent sexual harassment, but whatever it is, it needs to be on multiple fronts. We must start with teaching children, especially boys, that sexual harassment is unacceptable, like all bullying. As is clear from public health improvements, for example seat belts, pool fences and reducing drink driving, both active measures (sanctions) and passive measures (advocacy) will have to be used.",

      "title": "Review of Problems of Adolescent Sexual Behavior and the Role of Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 in Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Introduction: The problems of adolescents’ sexual behavior are grave and far-reaching. Methods: Review of exiting literature via Google scholar, AJOL, Pubmed, HINARI and other relevant data bases on the common problems of adolescents’ inappropriate sexual behavior. Result: Adolescent sexual behavior could result in adolescent pregnancy which prevalence varies widely throughout Nigeria perhaps due to differences in culture and development. Abortion, the willful termination of pregnancy is another problem which is often undertaken for pregnancies resulting from incest and sexual abuse. Also common is trans-generational sex which occurs when an adolescent has non-marital sex in the last 12 months with a man who is at least 10 years older than her. Also related to this, is transactional sex found in both committed and casual relationships. It is not always done for survival because in some cultures, sex for favor is carried out for reasons other than subsistence. Furthermore, multiple sexual partners are the engagement in sex with more than one partner over a particular time frame. It may be sequential or concurrent. The high prevalence of these problems in Nigeria raises a question of the possibility of achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) 4, 5 and 6 specifically targeted at reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases respectively. Conclusion: Policies and strategies such as family life and HIV/AIDs education (FLHE) curriculum on adolescent reproductive health should be pursued with greater vigor in our secondary schools in addition to establishing HIV counseling centers and vocational training programs for out-of-school adolescents. WHO support and commitment to key action areas for countries and member states will build and strengthen their capacity to improve reproductive and sexual health.",

It has potential for damaging the mental health of the victim and intergenerational cycles of this behaviour pattern may develop. The paediatrician is in a position to detect children at risk and may be able to intervene. Three types of sexual abuse are described (i) single sexual attacks which may be accompanied by physical violence: (ii) sexual exploitation of children for financial gain, and (iii) longstanding sexual relationships, generally between girls and father figures; these are far the most common. Although it is hard to separate the effects of premature sexual experience from other adverse environmental influences. the child victim of longstanding sexual abuse emerges immature, with considerable confusion as to her role in the family, and with constricted personality development. Her primary motivation is attention seeking, and she adopts sexual activity with an adult as a means of survival in often deplorable conditions. The sensitivity of management following the assault being made public is an important factor in determining eventual adjustment.",

Semen is a sensitive indicator of environmental, occupational and lifestyle exposures that can exert direct toxic effects and hormonal disruption. Damage may occur at any stage of life. However, while some exposures may produce reversible changes, others, especially damage to germinal cells in utero or prepuberty, may result in permanent sequelae. We review the main factors that affect human male fertility and their possible influence on human reproduction. Some lifestyles, xenoestrogens, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds are already known to compromise male reproductive function. Nonetheless, many questions remain, and we still know little about the effect of many other factors on male fertility.",

      "abstract": "All interest necessarily links the person with the external environment: the object/s of interest. Research into children's interests is examined in the context of a rapidly‐expanding literature which has generated several powerful concepts in recent decades, notably 'individual interest', 'situational interest' and 'topic interest'. The first is relatively robust and is usually represented as a manifestation of personality traits and psychological states. 'Situational interest', in contrast, relates to the learning environment, the context, and is essentially transitory. 'Topic interest' is more complex and a consensual definition has yet to emerge. It is conceived either as a subset of 'individual interest', involving a restricted part of a knowledge domain (the colloquial meaning of topic), or as a fluid amalgam of individual and situational interest. Very little research has been undertaken on science topic interest, the majority of related work dealing either with children's interests in science per se or with the efficacy of selected teaching approaches. Geoscience rarely figures within that body of science education literature, typically but only occasionally being included in lists of science topics offered to subjects for response. A sample of 652 11‐ and 12‐year‐old children was surveyed in 27 classrooms across 11 UK schools in order to identify existing geoscience interest. Results indicate that children have high interest in major geo‐events set in the geological past, present and future and in current environmental changes which have direct implications for the future of humanity. They also have coherent topic interest in gradual (i.e., uniformitarian) change in the geological past. Girls have a preference for phenomena perceived as aesthetically pleasing and boys have a preference for the extreme and catastrophic. Children from middle (8‐ to 12‐years) schools have less interest in geoscience generally than do children of the same age in secondary (11‐ to 18‐years) schools.",

Psychopathology within this group of disorders may lead to criminal behaviour, ranging from infringement of decency to some of the most heinous crimes known. In a lifetime of practice no professional in any sphere of law or medicine will see a full cross-section of these conditions, as some are rare and they do not all present to one professional group. The nomenclature is confusing, with its Greek, Latin, French and Portuguese origins, together with eponymous terms. At least 40 different paraphilias have been named (Money, 1988) but these do not cover the full extent of the field.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter continues the story of the rise of a concept of sexual health. Especially beginning in the 1990s, \"sexual health\" has served as a kind of discursive engine furiously propelling diverse and multivalent initiatives. A specific historical conjuncture, defined most notably by the global spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, gave the term prominence. The semantic flexibility of \"sexual health\" then permitted it to become the multipurpose solution to a range of social problems: sexually transmissible infections, sexual dysfunction, population growth and reproductive autonomy, the absence of sexual rights, sexual irresponsibility, and lack of sexual self-expression. As the phrase took on qualities of a buzzword, its ambiguous nature and flexibility permitted the term and concept to spread across domains, as well as to mobilize attention and resources. The capacity of \"health\" to sanitize and legitimize \"sexuality\" has granted sexual health a wide-ranging appeal; yet the different organizations and institutions that have taken up the concept have found it useful in quite varied ways. In addition, the effects of sexual health activities have differed significantly according to race, ethnicity, social class, and gender and sexual identity, causing some groups to benefit and others to be subjected to social scrutiny.",

Sexual behaviour, when discussed within a particular social context such as premarital, marital, or extramarital sexual behaviour, refers to those acts by an individual which involve another individual (imagined or real) and which centre around sexual gratification. Sexual interaction has at least two distinct functions: procreation, which accounts for only a tiny portion of coital activity in contemporary society, and recreation, which has always accounted for most sexual interaction, although the extent of recreational sex may be different for males and females. But 'revolution' is perhaps an overstatement if one considers sexual performance, values, and the attitudes that are more deeply rooted in the socialization process.",

      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology, and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this paper, I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is a biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental, or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation, it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory, and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

      "title": "Horrorporn/Pornhorror: The Problematic Communities and Contexts of Online Shock Imagery",
      "abstract": "Making an assessment of pornography and horror genres is problematic, not only because judgments of these have frequently been based on moral or ideological beliefs about what constitutes obscenity, but also because the viewing context impacts so significantly on their meaning. Obscene images are offensive because they contravene moral principles or because they portray what is considered to be indecent or repugnant. They are not necessarily sexual, although sexual behaviours are typically positioned as hidden or shameful in many societies. The conjunction of sex and other taboos such as defecation increases a depiction’s propensity to offend. The body’s uncivil nature - its sexual urges and the production of waste - may be inextricable from the self, but we are required to denounce those aspects of being, even though they can never be banished altogether (McAfee, 2004: 46). For Kristeva, this attempt at exclusion is a defining feature of subjectivity; “‘I’ expel it…I abject myself within the same motion through which ‘I’ claim to establish myself” (Kristeva, 1982: 3). In this violent process of abjection the ‘Other’ comes to stand in for “repressed…pathological violence and sexual perversion” (Bogue & Conis-Pope, 1996: 11).",

Ha sido explicada a través de varios modelos como el tetrafásico (Masters y Johnson, 1966), el trifásico (Kaplan, 1979), y el pentafásico (Bancroft, 1983), entre otros. El orgasmo se ubica como una de estas fases en estos modelos. Éste se define como un conjunto de sensaciones corporales sumamente placenteras y de excitación intensa, que libera tensiones y que produce satisfacción. Existen pocas diferencias entre el orgasmo del varón y de la hembra; desde un punto de vista funcional, el orgasmo del varón está estrechamente relacionado con la eyaculación, mientras que en la hembra no existe una conexión tan obvia y directa. En este estudio se recopilaron las semejanzas y diferencias presentes en el orgasmo del varón y de la hembra, referidas a los fundamentos anatómicos, fisiológicos, neuroendocrinos, neurológicos, psicológicos, socioculturales y espirituales.",

      "title": "The Erotic Transference in Women and in Men: Differences and Consequences",
      "abstract": "Although the erotic transference is believed to be universal, it is variable in its expression. Drawing on the distinction between transference resistance and resistance to the awareness of the transference, I have proposed that, in general, the erotic transference utilized as resistance is more common among women, while resistance to the awareness of the erotic transference is more common among male patients. Erotic transference as resistance poses different analytic problems from those posed by resistance to its awareness. With women in treatment with men, the erotic transference is more often overt, consciously experienced, intense, long-lived and directed toward the analyst, and focused more on love than sex; with men in treatment with women, the erotic transference is muted, relatively short-lived, appears indirectly in dreams and triangular preoccupations, is seldom consciously experienced as a dominant affective motif, is frequently transposed to a woman outside the analytic situation, and most often appears as sexual rather than as a longing for love. In women, the strength of the erotic transference may obscure other important dynamics and conflicts. In short, the strength of the erotic transference, while it has significant therapeutic potential, often acts as a strong transference resistance to working out underlying conflicts. In contrast, in male patients in treatment with women, there is a resistance to the experience of the transference and, frequently, one witnesses defenses against the erotic transference rather than the transference itself. Yet, the dangers are substantial when the erotic transference fails to develop or is suppressed. This difference in the manifestation of the erotic transference parallels an extratherapeutic difference. In general, women achieve their self-identity as women by virtue of certain defining relationships, whereas men achieve their self-identity as men through achievement and autonomy. The reasons for these differences have been explored in terms of cultural dictates, but more particularly in terms of an asymmetry in psychological development.",

      "title": "Erectile Dysfunction: Terms, Definitions, Frequency",
      "abstract": "As clinicians have observed, erectile disorders occur more frequently than other sexual dysfunctions in males seeking medical advice. This article deals with the terms used for defining disturbances of erection. In the author’s opinion, a commonly used term “erectile dysfunction” (ED) is actually much wider than the states it defines. This is due to the fact that disturbances of erection can be manifested by not only its weakening (hypoerection) or absence (anerection), but increasing (hypererection that occurs in cases of priapism and pseudopriapism) as well. It is noted that the term “erectile dysfunction” replaced the term “impotence”, which with time acquired a derogative tint (impotence → impotent). Nevertheless, in order to define somatogenic hypo(an)erection ICD-10 still used the category “impotence of organic origin”, which is absent in ICD-11. The article also analyses such terms and concepts as “impotentia coeundi” (the collective name for all sexual dysfunctions) and “impotentia generandi” (inability to reproduce, sterility). It is noted that earlier the term “impotence” was used for defining various sexual dysfunctions in females too. Definitions and diagnostic criteria for hypo(an)erectile disturbances in international (ICD-9, ICD-10 and ICD-11) and American (DSM-4 and DSM-5) classifications are given and discussed. The author believes that, according to the latest classifications, the ability to diagnose a sexual dysfunction (including ED) only in case when this problem persists for a long period of time (a few months, six months) is not reasonable. If a person is not treated during this period, the quality of his life can significantly aggravate, and he can develop disorders of the neurotic level. Sometimes within this time period the dysfunction may be eliminated spontaneously. In case with a specialist in clinical sexology, who is sufficiently experienced, he will be able to make an appropriate diagnosis within a much shorter period than it is envisaged by the given diagnostic criterion. Another diagnostic criterion used in latest classifications is also worth discussing, according to which the diagnosis of any sexual dysfunction can be established in the presence of clinically significant distress. It is the author’s opinion that the use of the above diagnostic criterion can distort the diagnostic process. In particular, it should be noted that in some males the present ED or any other sexual dysfunction really сan not cause any clinically significant distress, but this fact does not cancel their presence and should not become the reason for which this dysfunction cannot be diagnosed. Otherwise, we can talk about subjectification of the situation and overstepping of the medical field boundaries by diagnostics. The article also contains different data on the prevalence of ED. Conclusions. Special attention is paid to such criteria as the duration of the disorder (from several months to 6 months) and the mandatory presence of clinically significant distress. However, the requirement for a long course of sexual dysfunction is not justified, since during this time the patient’s quality of life can deteriorate significantly, and sometimes the disorder can disappear on its own. In some cases, the existing ED does not cause distress, but this should not be a reason for refusing to establish a diagnosis. The above statistics indicate a high prevalence of ED among men of different ages, which confirms the relevance of the problem and the need for its further study.",

Working in integrated teams and under the upcoming changes in reimbursement, primary care providers will be able to screen for, assess, treat, and/or refer sexual problems to colleagues within and outside of their practice. This requires a small but significant increase in the team’s level of knowledge about sex. Sexual problems have multiple etiologies: physical, including hormonal and structural, individual/psychological, and relationship-based. These causes interact with one another and require concurrent, rather than sequential, interventions. Major sexual problem areas include low and/or discrepant desire levels, difficulty becoming aroused (erectile dysfunction in men, low excitement in women), difficulty in achieving orgasm in women and men, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain in women. Working through integrated, multidisciplinary teams, much more can be done for patients in this important area of health.",

      "title": "Mammalian Pheromones: Fact or Fantasy?",
      "abstract": "The focus of this chapter is on a putative class of stimuli commonly termed \"pheromones.\" Pheromones are said to differ from other chemical stimuli in having been evolved to transfer specific information among conspecifics critical for sexual, agonistic, and other forms of social behavior, as well as for altering the reproductive processes of the recipient (e.g., the age of puberty, the timing of estrus, and ova implantation). Although nearly a half-century has elapsed since the pheromone term was coined, few substances considered to be pheromones have been chemically identified and there is still a legitimate question as to the utility of the pheromone concept in describing or explaining chemically mediated social behaviors and endocrine responses of vertebrates. How is one to identify a pheromone? Are there generally accepted criteria for making such an identification? Does evoking the pheromone concept add to our understanding of the behaviors or endocrine responses of interest? The goal of this chapter is to explore these issues. Largely because of space limitations, this review is not inclusive. A broader set of examples, as well as an exploration of the question as to whether humans possess pheromones,* is presented*The reader is referred to a number of recent critiques of studies of menstrual synchrony and the concept of human pheromones (Arden and Dye, 1998; Schank, 2000, 2001; Strassmann, 1999; Whitten, 1999; Wilson, 1992; Wöhrmannj-Repenning, 2000).",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as “all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, development or dignity.” There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

      "title": "[A case of diaper fetishism].",
      "abstract": "Some people cannot obtain satisfaction from ordinary sexual relationships; instead they prefer alternative methods. They are referred to in psychiatric terminology as paraphiliacs. Fetishism is a type of paraphilia in which a person is sexually attracted to objects and some body parts. Most fetishists do not intend to cause harm to other people, but may have problems when others become involved in the problem. Underlying personality disorders extending through childhood are thought to be the source of the etiology. Perverted people do not wish to change their behavior pattern. They never seek treatment from a therapist. Psychological issues obviously play a crucial role in determining the choice of paraphilia and the underlying meaning of the sexual acts. Psychodynamic models (object relations theory, self psychology, drive theory) can shed light on the meaning of a perversion. In this case report, a 22- year-old man with diaper fetishism is presented. When family dynamics are considered, the mother has been described as psychologically distant from her son. The fetish object was recognized during childhood at around the age of four. During puberty, the fetish object became sexually attractive. Our patient exhibited his first perverted behavior when he was six years old. Later, he could control this behavior. At the age of twelve, the perverted behavior became sexually arousing. This paper emphasizes the diaper fetishism case through the patient's past psychiatric and medical history. Diaper fetishism is discussed in the light of forensic, cognitive and psychodynamic theories.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

The sample of the present study form 50 male delinquents children from “Bal-Sampreshan Grah”, Manacamp, Raipur (C.G.) were purposively selected for the study. These juvenile delinquents sometimes have mental disorders/behavioural issues such as post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder, and are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorder partially as a result of their delinquent behaviours. Many factors like schools, neighbourhood, Family, Society, Situations are equally responsible for the degradation or fall of a child. Hence, instead of labelling them as one we must try and find ways, rectify the errors in their lives which led them to behave in this manner.

Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

Yet, even after years of advocacy, only recently has the importance of sex as a biological and experimental variable been addressed1–4. Indeed, the majority of biomedical research is conducted with male animals and cells, neglects to report which sexes were studied or fails to mention if any sex-differences were identified5–6. In addition to being an exclusionary practice, this unidimensional approach to biological processes may be a root cause of the concerns regarding rigour and reproducibility of scientific research7.",

      "title": "¿se puede hablar realmente de actos de “violencia sexual” en los contextos de chemsex?",
      "abstract": "espanolDesde que el ChemSex (el uso intencionado de drogas con fines sexuales entre hombres gais y bisexuales) se diera a conocer a nivel mediatico, especial atencion ha cobrado de parte muchos sectores. Recientemente se ha comenzado a mencionar, desde fuera de este colectivo, la ocurrencia de “violencia sexual” en los contextos donde se lo practica, pero muchos hombres no entienden como tal los “actos sexuales sin consentimiento (expreso)” que pudieran darse. Este ensayo busca entender, desde una perspectiva cultural, por que muchos hombres no se reconocen como “victimas” o “agresores” de “violencia sexual” en contextos de ChemSex. Como el ChemSex ocurre dentro de la cultura gay, la cual tiene sus propios codigos, normas, valores, lenguaje, etc. que son diferentes a los de la cultura dominante (heterosexual), los significados y entendimientos en torno al contacto fisico y al sexo son diferentes. Ademas, partiendo que la intencion es tener sexo y por las formas de contacto (p.e. virtual) y encuentro (p.e. locales de sexo), entienden que los consentimientos pueden darse de manera diferente a la verbal o que estan dados de manera tacita dentro de las propias dinamicas de relacionamiento socio-sexual, por eso no se reconocen como “victimas” ni como “agresores”. EnglishSince ChemSex (deliberate sex under influence of drugs among gay, bisexuals and other men who have sex with men) became known at the media level, special attention has received from many sectors. Recently, the occurrence of sexual assaults has been mentioned from outside this community in contexts where it is practiced, but many men don’t understand as such the sexual acts without consent (verbal) that can occur. This essay seeks to understand, from a cultural perspective, why many men don’t recognize themselves as victims or offenders of sexual assaults in the ChemSex scene. As ChemSex is a practice that occurs within the gay sex culture, which has its own codes, norms, values, language, etc. that are different from those of the dominant culture (heterosexual), the meanings and understandings around physical contact and sex are different. Furthermore, since the intention is to have sex and due to the forms of dating (e.g. virtual) and meeting (e.g. sex venues), they understand that consents can be given differently than verbally or that are already tacitly given within the dynamics of the and social relationship that are formed in these spaces, so they don’t recognize themselves as “victims” neither “offenders” of assaults.",

      "abstract": "Domestic violence is any act against a person, especially a woman that results in physical, sexual, psychological misery or suffering, and/or neglect of the household, including threats to commit acts, coercion, or deprivation of liberty against the law within the household. Domestic violence is narrowly defined as an act or threat of violence against someone with whom the perpetrator has a deep relationship. Domestic violence is also closely related to violence against children. While children may not be physically harmed, seeing or hearing their parents being abused can be psychologically devastating. Maturity in Latin verbs is called the term adult or adolescene which means to grow into maturity Adult in Dutch is volwassen which means full and wassen means to grow, so volwassen means that it has fully grown or has finished growing Therefore, adults are individuals who have completed their growth and ready to accept a position in society along with other adults. However, a person's maturity can be disturbed if the child lives in a less harmonious family environment or a broken home, because domestic violence (domestic violence) not only affects the parents but also their children. Because the problem of violence (especially in the household) is a form of crime that abuses and tarnishes human dignity, and should be categorized as a type of crime against the law of humanity.",

      "abstract": "There are few conditions that have such wide-ranging effects on sexual function as obesity. Though many of the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, its impacts on the cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous systems, among others, bestow upon obesity an almost unrivaled ability to devastate the human sexual response. Further, the effects of obesity extend beyond the purely physiologic into the psychologic and have the ability to impair both males and females alike. The downstream sequelae of sexual dysfunction secondary to obesity can significantly impair an individual’s quality of life, affecting his or her self-esteem, opportunity to form and maintain meaningful relationships, and ability to reproduce if desired, all of which can further promote pro-obesogenic attitudes and behaviors. Thus there is tremendous incentive for appreciation and understanding of the complex interplay between obesity and sexual function, as well as their relation to an individual’s overall physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Dentro de la cultura salvadorena, se comparten diversas ideologias sobre las actividades y comportamientos que se producen al momento de relacionarse con los demas; cuando una ideologia es compartida por la mayoria de las personas esta se convierte en norma y se mantienen un orden relativamente logico y adecuado para la convivencia. Esta dinamica supone la construccion de una serie de valores morales que trastocan y definen areas significativas en la vida de las personas. Sin duda alguna una de las areas de mayor trascendencia y que se ha visto coartada en diferentes aspectos y medidas, es el area de la sexualidad. Es por ello que en los ultimos anos se ha mantenido un continuum de informacion discrepante en cuestion de propaganda sexual e informacion formal sobre el tema, sobre todo de parte de los medios de comunicacion y ultimamente por medio de las redes sociales; naturalizando actitudes poco saludables, separando la afectividad del ambito sexual, y reduciendo esta ultima al mero contacto fisico, eyaculacion, orgasmo y el conocimiento de la composicion fisiologica humana o metodos de anticoncepcion, relegando a un segundo lugar la parte afectiva relacional, y el componente psicologico que se enmarca en la situacion. La repercusion mayor se ha visto en la adolescencia, cuya psique esta en desarrollo y el manejo y discernimiento de dicha informacion les es de dificil comprension debido a la doble via de mensajes que entran a su consciencia; planteandoles una compleja eleccion sobre el que hacer frente a las exigencias del medio y lo que en realidad saben o desean. Igualmente influye el contexto cultural y relacional sobre todo en el caso de la familia cuando no hay apertura para poder preguntar sobre estos temas tan importantes debido a que son considerados tabu. Como resultado los adolescentes terminan introduciendose prematuramente al campo de las relaciones sexo-\r\ncoitales cometiendo diferentes errores, arriesgandose a enfermedades y embarazos, y con ello exponiendose a secuelas psicologicas.",

This chapter expands on Reiss'(1986) idea that two characteristics are key to sexuality: physical pleasure and self-disclosure.1 Sexuality, then, is that drive of each individual to seek intimacy, a reciprocal self-disclosure with another human being, while also seeking sensual bodily pleasure. Sometimes the expression of intimacy takes precedence over sensual pleasure; at other times sensual pleasure is primarily expressed. Other factors must be considered as integral parts of sexuality, such as how one plays one's gender role, body image, sexual orientation, and biological functioning. All these factors, in turn, are mediated and affected by one's culture, in the broad sense, society, and in the more narrow sense, one's community, subgroups, and family. The complex interrelationship between those factors profoundly influences how one expresses one's own sexuality.",

      "title": "Sexual objectification and dehumanization: Implications for women’s sexual agency",
      "abstract": "While ideally sexual activities would only take place when mutually desired, many women participate in sex that they do not want. During their lifetimes, between 18% and 25% of women will experience rape or attempted rape, and 50% or more will experience some form of unwanted sexual activity (Gavey & Senn, 2014). The present research tests whether women’s ability to exercise sexual agency is undermined when her internal sense of humanness has been diminished by others thinking of and treating her like an object. In patriarchal cultures, women are chronically sexually objectified: represented as sexual objects, existing primarily for men’s sexual use. Conceptually, objectification implies dehumanization and previous research has found that when people evaluate another person’s appearance, they dehumanize women but not men (Heflick et al., 2011). When women or men are dehumanized by others, they self-dehumanize (i.e., experience diminished human characteristics and feel more object-like) (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017; Bastian & Haslam, 2010; Loughnan et al., 2017) and experience diminished agency (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017). Building on this previous research, the present research has two goals. Study 1 tests whether women are more commonly viewed as less human than men. In Study 2, experiences of being dehumanized were then examined as a cause of diminished agency (self-reported self-efficacy and sexual agency) due to self dehumanization. Women and men do not experience dehumanization equally. When people focus on another person’s appearance, women are viewed as less human than men; when instructed to focus on their performance or on them as a person, women and men are not viewed differently (Heflick et al., 2011). The conclusion from this research was that women are viewed as less human than men when the focus is on their appearance. Study 1 of the present research tested an alternate hypothesis: that women are generally viewed as less human than men except when the focus is on their personhood. Before viewing a video featuring either a woman or a man, participants were either given no instructions or were asked to focus on one of three things: the subject’s appearance; the subject as a person; or the video. Consistent with the hypothesis, when given no instructions, participants viewed the women as less human than the men (i.e., lower on competence and human characteristics). Study 2 then examined whether being dehumanized impacts women’s sense of their own humanness and, consequently, their sense of agency. After recalling either an experience of having their appearance evaluated by others or an experience of being treated primarily as an instrument in the workplace, women and men rated their internal feelings of humanness. Moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that both situations caused women and men to self-dehumanize and in turn report lower self-efficacy. Contrary to predictions, however, self-dehumanization did not diminish either women’s or men’s sexual agency. Challenges examining sexual agency are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) classifies the incongruence that trans individuals experience between their assigned sex at birth (and the associated gender role and/or primary and secondary sex characteristic) and gender identity (how they see themselves with respect to gender) as Gender Dysphoria. Transsexualism is defined by the International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Diseases, edition 10 (ICD-10) (World Health Organization, 1992) as a desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex. The new edition, ICD-11, is expected to acknowledge individuals who do not necessarily wish to transition from one binary gender to the other (male to female or female to male). Although there are several different terms used within the literature to describe people who feel an incongruence between their assigned sex at birth and gender identity, throughout this article the terms 'trans people/individuals','trans women' and 'trans men' will be used. Trans women are those who were assigned male at birth on the basis of genital appearance but who later identify themselves as female. Trans men are those who were assigned female at birth based on their genital appearance but identify as male. Recent studies have reported an overall meta-analytical prevalence for transsexualism of 4.6 in 100,000 individuals; 6.8 for trans women and 2.6 for trans men, which is primarily based on studies looking at individuals attending clinical services (Arcelus et al., 2015).",

      "title": "Keyhole Testimony: Witnessing Sodomy in the Eighteenth Century",
      "abstract": "Shop-keepers some there wereAnd men of good repute,Each vow'd a Bachelor,Unnat'ral Lust pursu'dThe Women Hater's Lamentation (1707)1Much of what was written about sodomy during the eighteenth century remains amazingly vague. With a few crucial exceptions, broadsides and fictional accounts describe sodomy in very general terms, not as a transgressive sexual practice that involves certain unspeakable activities, but rather as a set of specific habits of dress or personal hygiene, often a foreign accent or questionable religious leanings, and occasionally a taste for opera.2 Even the socalled trial accounts themselves most often talk around sodomy, explaining for instance that men in the molly house were making love or that one man was caught in the act of seducing another-with a hand in his breeches, for instance-without any corroborating evidence or actual physical description of sodomitical relations.3At signal, rare moments, however, descriptions of sodomy include a visual account putatively based on observation that offers readers a titillating insight into the dynamics of unnatural activity. In the trial of Thomas Rodin (October 1722), for instance, Henry clay ton tells the court:I and the Prisoner lodg'd in one Room, at Peter Wright's, a Shoemaker, at the Three Shoes next Door to the Harrow in Long-Alley in Moorfields. My Landlady keeps a Baudy-house, and lets out Lodgings. Some Time in March last,-I forget the Day,-there accidentally comes in a Stranger to lodge, the Prisoner drank with him, and at half an Hour past ten they went up to Bed together; and saw the Prisoner lying with him in the Nature of carnal Copulation, as a Man lies with a Woman.Court. How you be sure of that.Clayton. not put my Hand between them; but it was a Moon-light Night, and was abed in the same room, and see what they plain enough.4Henry Clayton's account depends on direct visual testimony: clayton sees two men in the act of copulation. As unimaginative as his description is, it does suggest some of the ways in which sodomy is already coded. The visual account is enhanced by the moonlight and the intimacy of the observer, and even these simple details work to create a scene. Moreover, clayton's tantalizing claim that he did not put my Hand between (misprinted as I put my hand between in a recent edition of these trials) serves to emphasize his physical proximity and to give credence to his observation, which concludes with the claim that he could see what they plain enough (my emphasis). But clayton's account also demonstrates the perils of such close observation:5Court. How long was it before you spoke of this?Clayton. spoke on't the next Day.Court. And why you not prosecute sooner?Clayton is very quickly on the defensive here, and before very long his testimony has been thoroughly discredited. This is in part because his own character has been rendered questionable, not because of any activity of his own but because of his intimacy with the scene of sodomy itself. Sodomy is dangerously seductive, as this moonlit scene suggests.6 Clayton can hardly keep his hands away from the copulating couple.For the obvious reason that proximity implies guilty association, then, such accounts are often framed as keyhole testimony, in which an observer watches certain sexual activities from a distance and then reports them to a listener or an audience, either in a court of law or another social situation, such as an antisodomy tract or a novel. Rather than get so close that the observer touch the participants, in other words, a doorway or a partition usually separates the observer from the scene of sodomy. This gives precedence to a visual account of the scene and offers a new set of erotic dynamics, as the following account suggests.In the trial record for John Dicks (April 1722), for instance, the following testimony is recorded:William Rogers. …",

      "abstract": "Perçue à travers le sens commun comme un pur phénomène de nature, la ménopause s'est au contraire révélée à travers notre recherche comme une vaste construction sociale dépassant largement la désignation de l'arrêt de la fonction reproductive féminine pour inclure des maladies, des modifications de l'apparence, des transformations de la valeur et des rôles sociaux attribués et imposés aux femmes. Forgé à partir du grec par un médecin français au début du XIX e siècle, le terme de ménopause signifie littéralement « arrêt des règles » mais son champ sémantique s'étend jusqu'à un objet qui n'a pas de nom propre, la « ménopause masculine », terme fréquemment utilisé dans les écrits anglo-saxons. Notre enquête menée en France auprès des femmes de 45 à 65 ans, et des hommes de 50 à 60 ans, montre que l'expérience des femmes s'étend selon un registre très étendu. Pour une forte minorité il s'agit d'un sentiment de perte majeure du fait de l'arrêt des règles et de la fécondité, ainsi qu'une perte du capital santé, du capital esthétique et surtout du capital symbolique. Pour la majorité des femmes, la ménopause constitue plutôt un non-événement, une évolution physiologique sans conséquence particulière quant à leur valeur sociale notamment. Enfin une minorité exprime une forte satisfaction. D'une part les représentations dominantes de la ménopause s'inscrivent dans le processus de la domination symbolique masculine, et d'autre part cette domination est aujourd'hui limitée à une minorité de femmes.",

The research method was to see background of the concept of kitsch through the domestic and international publications, the Internet, paper. Five designers’ collections that have characteristics of kitsch were selected. The range of collection is from the 2000 S/S to 2011 F/W in Mens collection. The results are as follows: kitsch characteristics could be classified by amusements, inappropriateness, satire. First, exaggerative amusements in men’s collection appeared exaggerated form, large size, which is ridiculous at the same time. Infantile amusements represents the image of a pure concentric matching accessories such as toys to the children express. sensual amusements reveals the sexual instincts and desires and people can feel satisfaction through sensual amusements. Second, inappropriateness is characteristic of kitsch to escape from normal life. Clothing does not fit the body and destroyed the design or design of this feature appears. It looks clumsy and strange. Inappropriateness characteristic in men’s collection can be divided into inadequate performance and sexual inappropriateness. Third, satire can be divided into resistant satire, imitative satire, and popular satire. Resistance satire with anti-social tendencies through their clothing is achieved by expressing their needs. It was affected by sub-culture like Hippie or Punk. Imitative satire is to imitate other culture, customs and race. It is to resolve complaints through the consumption of things in disparities of wealth and materialism in the society. Popular satire is to express emotions that are free using materials that can recycling like can, bottle or paper.",

      "abstract": "This article contends that youth who engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or, sexually abusive behaviors are too often viewed primarily through a criminological lens, regardless of their age, gender, judicial status, and/or experiences of past trauma/victimization. Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

      "abstract": "This symposium is concerned with rehabilitation, ergonomics and preventing work disability. Specifically it is concerned with determining the state of the science and identifying research opportunities that could result in major reductions in work disability. Disability has be defined as (Brandt and Pope 1997): Disability is defined as a limitation in performing certain roles and tasks that society expects of an individual It is the expression of the gap between a person's capabilities and the demands of the environment - the interaction of person's limitations with social and physical environmental factors. Available data show that there are many persons in our society who are disabled in that they are unable to achieve expectations established by employers, e.g., production rates, quantities and quality, without endangering themselves or others in the workplace or community. This expectation typically extends to forty hours per week, but could be more or less hours. Limitations in performance may result from conditions of birth, illness or injury. They also may be a primary or secondary effect of work. This is the case with Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders; WMSDs. WMSDs are a leading cause of work disability and compensation in many contemporary work settings. Although this program focuses on prevention of disability due to WMSDs, it is broadly concerned with the prevention of all disability. The models and methods discussed have common elements that are applicable to many if not all persons and situations. For example, the above definition defines disability as a “gap” between job demands and worker capacities. This definition applies to a person with paraplegia as well as a person with carpal tunnel syndrome. In both instances, methods are needed for assessing and comparing worker capacities and job demands. The program includes presentations by leading investigators who will draw on their own work and work of others to describe the state of the art and develop recommendations for future research.",

In addition, the women's original family environments, state—trait anxiety levels, body images and gender role identities were assessed. Both women and husbands were found to have some problems related to sexual satisfaction in general. Although the husbands seemed to have no problems about sexual relations, it was noted that the women did not have sexual contact frequently, tended to avoid sex and were not very sensual during the sexual interaction. They had fears of pain, physical harm or death during coitus and delivery. Most of the couples evaluated their marriages as satisfctory. Trait anxiety level, wives' evaluations of their husbands as undependable, and authoritarian—oppressive attitudes of the parents were found to be the predictive variables of vaginismus.",

      "abstract": "1. The functional sexual phases of four species of Pacific coast gastropods with protandric consecutive sexuality have been investigated with regard to the conditions which control the change of sexual phase and particularly with respect to the influence of association or mating on the individual's sexuality. 2. In none of these species nor in six species previously studied is association a prerequisite for the development of the functional male phase, although isolation of these males after a prolonged mating period usually terminates the male phase promptly. 3. In nine of the ten species studied intimate association or permanent mating of the young male with one or more individuals in the female phase tends to accentuate the masculine characteristics and to postpone sexual transformation by prolonging the male phase. In five of these ten species the influence of association is very conspicuous; in four it is apparent but not conspicuous; in only one is the evidence inconclusive. 4. There seems to be no evidence that the accentuation and prolongation of the male phase by association is due to any masculinizing chemical secretion or hormone which passes through the water from the body of the female to that of the male, as some investigators have assumed; it seems more probable that stimuli received by the male through the sense organs in his penis and tentacles during association with the female are of such a nature as to influence his masculine characteristics, presumably by the mediation of hormones secreted within his own body. 5. Sexual maturity and sexual metamorphosis in these mollusks, like other types of metamorphosis in animals, are subject to environmental influences and can be accelerated, postponed or inhibited experimentally, but the sequence of sexual phases cannot be reversed.",

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour: older people's repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

      "title": "Sexual Ethics in Iranian Medicine",
      "abstract": "Context: Effect of sexual relations on mental and physical health has been the concern of the Iranian physicians, over a thousand years ago. Sexual ethics is one of the specific health topics of Iranian medicine archives. From the Iranian medicine point of view, because of different mental and physical differences in human, their sexual power and need for sex is different. It is necessary to observe the normal range, since the sexual indulgence causes different illnesses. Evidence Acquisitions: In Iranian medicine, different variables such as time, location, mental and physical situation, and also various forms of sex are discussed in sexual health. Safe sex not just reduces many mental disorders, but also prevents many neurological, digestive, urinary and genital disorders. Also, sexual indulgence is most harmful for health and causes stiffness, weakness and different diseases; therefore observing moderation in sex, according to the therapeutic characteristics and power, has been emphasized. Results: To have safe sex, it is necessary to consider time, mental, and physical status. Having sex when the stomach is full impairs digestion. Sexual relationship after heavy sports and severe emotional reactions such as anger or sadness, and after diarrhea or blood sampling is harmful. It has been recommended that having sex in temperate weather, and after evacuation of urine and feces, considering necessary arrangements, make the couple reach orgasm. Also, in the Iranian traditional medicine references, specific nutritional and health recommendations have been proposed for the sexually active people. Conclusions: Health care recommendations of Iranian physicians involve precious and new points for the updated scientific communities. Scientific revision of these recommendations can be promising for public health improvement.",

      "abstract": "AVE you ever seen a stuttering girl?A girl, that is, who chronically stutters?If so, you have observed a phenomenon which is rare, although stuttering boys are common enough.However badly coordinated or hysterical may be the actions of girls and young women, the disturbances seldom take the form of the annoying repetition of the same syllable which is properly called stuttering.That other form of stammering in which there is a deadlocking of the vocal apparatus so that no sound is uttered for a painfully long period, with practically no other abnormal behavior, is also relatively infrequent in females.Stuttering, and to a less extent stammering in general, is peculiarly a masculine derangement.It is obvious that there must be some connection between this sex-limitation of stuttering, and the cause or causes of the trouble.The source of stuttering must be sought in some peculiarity of the language function of the male which is not found in the language function of the female, and not, as is popularly supposed, in mere shock, fright or 'nervousness.'I have heard detailed stories concerning various stutterers, dating the beginnings of their speech difficulty from a severe fright in one case, from the shock of an accident in another case, from an attack of typhoid which left a weakened system in another, and soon.Even if we were not forced to discount these histories heavily, we would be obliged to conclude that they are only contributing causes; agencies which by weakening the resistance gave the real cause a chance to get in its deadly work.The theory of stuttering which suggests itself most",

      "title": "Spotlight on… mental health",
      "abstract": "There is a complex interplay between physical, psychosocial, and emotional factors and mental state. A multifactorial unpleasant, emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioural, emotional), social and/or spiritual nature may interfere with the ability to cope effectively with a disease, its physical symptoms and its treatment. A precise definition of what constitutes a psychosexual problem or dysfunction is difficult to define. They are not only reported by women who have undergone extensive surgery for their cancers or suffer from other benign gynaecological conditions, but are often reported by women presenting with other non-pathological gynaecological and obstetric issues such as continuing pelvic pain despite negative laparoscopy, persistent vaginal discharge, vulvodynia, vaginismus, associated nonconsumption and tokophobia. The articles selected in this series, put together especially for International Women's Day, provide a broad overview of mental health. Women experience major depression twice as often as men, mainly during the reproductive years. This is unrelated to culture, race or class. Conlon and Lynch (TOG 2008;10:151–155) point out that approximately 10% of pregnant women will experience clinically significant depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Lowes et al. (TOG 2012;14:179–187) point out that anorexia nervosa, although usually recognised as a self-limiting eating disorder among young adolescent females, has the highest maternal mortality rate during pregnancy among all psychiatric disorders, along with a six-fold increase in perinatal mortality. Anorexia is associated with other psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (40%), that make women with anorexia more vulnerable to postnatal depression. More than 100 women die annually in the USA, with the most immediate cause of death being suicide. Oates (TOG 2008;10:145–150 and TOG 2008;10:231–235) and Di Florio et al. (TOG 2013;15:145–150) highlight that all types of psychiatric disorders can complicate the postpartum period, arising either denovo or as a recurrence or relapse of a pre-existing condition. They point out that postpartum disorders, such as puerperal psychosis and depressive illness, warrant special attention. The first 90 days of the postpartum period are associated with an altered risk of psychosis and severe depressive illness. All women, especially primiparous women and those suffering from bipolar disorders (severe affective disorders), should be screened antenatally for the known risk factors. There is increased risk among primiparous women; it is multifactorial and a combination of biological, generic and hormonal changes postpartum may act as a trigger. Women with a history of serious psychiatric illness, peripartum or otherwise, should be assessed by a psychiatrist in the antenatal period to ensure that a management plan involving all of the disciplines relevant to their care can be drawn up. I recommend that clinical practice guidelines should be based on 2007 NICE Guidance and the RCOG Good Practice Paper - Management of women with mental health issues during pregnancy and the postnatal period. The diagnosis of cancer casts a huge emotional disruption, a negative impact on sexual function and reduces quality of life. Even among cancer survivors, there is a negative impact on women's physiological wellbeing. Kew et al. (TOG 2002;4:193–196) point out that psychosexual functioning does not usually improve with time, even among survivors. Mitchell (TOG 2011;13:22–28) urges that ‘distress screening tools’ be implemented to identify unmet needs. A coherent strategy is required to deal with the psychosexual dysfunction in women after treatment for a gynaecological malignancy. Sinclair and Ramsay (TOG 2011;13:143–148) reported that women with urinary incontinence experience sexual dysfunction, a greater psychological morbidity (particularly major depression, which has been shown to be more common in incontinent women, adding to the cycle of low self-esteem), increased social withdrawal and, ultimately, a reduction in quality of life. An increasing number of couples are seeking assistance with advanced reproductive techniques and the couples may experience a roller coaster of emotions, including despair, hope, anger and anxiety, sadness, isolation and grief. Unsuccessful treatment can have long-term impacts on relationships with a partner and friends, and women may suffer from more severe symptoms of depression. Joy and McCrystal (TOG 2015;17:83–89), and Bryson and Traub (TOG 2002;4:201–204) propose that infertility services should also focus on a patient's changing psychosocial needs “by providing effective, holistic and patient-centred counselling services”. Burnel (TOG 2011;13:154–160), and Cowan and Frodsham (TOG 2015;17:47–53) point out that approximately 20% of women attending general gynaecological outpatient clinic have psychosexual symptoms; they present as chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, vulvodynia, hypoactive sexual desire disorder and repeated requests for gynaecological surgery. The relationship between medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and other forms of psychiatric disorders is probably complex and there is an increased lifetime risk of depression. It is important to note that this association operates in both directions: people with an episode of depression are more likely to develop an episode of MUS and those with MUS are more likely to develop an episode of depression. Coulson and Crowley (TOG 2007;9:217–222) elucidate that sexual difficulties are not uncommon among both heterosexual and homosexual women; they were reported by 43% of women. The problems of female sexual difficulties result from a combination of biological, psychological and interpersonal factors, and are poorly understood. Quite often, covert presentation of a sexual difficulty can take the form of complaints about pelvic pain, distress about periods, and general dissatisfaction with a contraceptive. Rymer et al. (TOG 2010;12:237–243) reviewed the multifactorial aetiology of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which can affect women of all ages, but the incidence is high among surgically-induced menopausal women. An increased professional awareness of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and knowledge about effective therapeutic intervention is warranted. Women expect tomorrow's specialists to provide psychosexual medical services but there is little or no training in this area for medical students, obstetrics and gynaecology trainees and specialists. An improvement in the education of healthcare professionals working with these patients, and an increase in the number of staff available, will be required in order to ensure that these women receive the support that they need. Furthermore, clinicians also need to know the key concepts as described in the Mental Capacity Act 2005. This subject has been ably covered by Nicholas and Nicholas (TOG 2010;12:29–34).

      "title": "Contextes de travail et pluralité dispositionnelle des femmes chirurgiens digestifs",
      "abstract": "La profession chirurgicale apparait, de par son histoire et son recrutement professionnel, une specialite masculine par excellence. L'idealtype professionnel est par ailleurs empreint de manieres de faire, dire et penser eminemment viriles et la domination masculine est tres presente. Les femmes qui investissent la specialite, veritables exceptions statistiques, doivent bien souvent s'accommoder de la violence verbale et/ou symbolique exercee par leurs collaborateurs hommes. Un patrimoine dispositionnel a dominante masculine - constitue bien souvent en amont de l'exercice professionnel - reste une excellente ressource pour faire face a ce contexte agonistique des rapports sociaux de sexe qui regne au bloc operatoire. Toutefois, a y regarder de plus pres, on s'apercoit que meme les femmes chirurgiens les plus masculines activent des dispositions feminines dans certains contextes, mettant alors en veille leurs dispositions masculines , dispositions qu'elles peuvent mettre en œuvre dans d'autres contextes et a d'autres moments de leur trajectoire. La pluralite dispositionnelle des enquetees apparait donc a la fois comme diachronique (elles mettent en œuvre des dispositions sexuees tantot masculines, tantot feminines selon les differentes etapes de leur parcours professionnel) et synchronique (a une meme etape de leur carriere elles mettent en œuvre des dispositions sexuees differentes selon les sollicitations des contextes et des interlocuteurs qu'elles rencontrent). On a montre notamment, a la suite de Joan Cassell (1998), que les femmes chirurgiens ne se comportaient pas de la meme facon selon qu'elles interagissaient avec les chirurgiens hommes ou avec les infirmieres. Par ailleurs, les trajectoires genrees des enquetees se caracterisent par une pente allant du masculin vers plus de feminin puisque, tendanciellement, les enquetees se masculinisent fortement au moment de la formation de l'internat et qu'elles vont vers des modalites de comportements plus feminines a mesure qu'elles font l'experience de la maternite et qu'elles avancent dans le metier, gagnant en autonomie par rapport aux collegues masculins.",

      "abstract": "Only a few psychoanalysts have any experience with transvestism, transsexualism, and transgenderism. Transsexuals, stricto sensu, are people in whom the identity component is the dominant factor: they simply cannot live with/in the male body with which they were born. Transsexuals feel \"comfortable\" when they wear women's clothing because this gives them the appearance of being women and thus corresponds to their intimate feeling of actually being women. Some transsexuals try not to show any sexual desire so that they could be considered as \"true transsexuals\" and be operated on. When they speak of their desires, the male-to-female transsexuals usually say they have desire for a man, and the female-to-male transsexuals usually say they have desire for a woman. In girls, being sexually attracted to another girl is often at the heart of their discovery of themselves as transsexual. Female-to-male transsexuals often come to a specialist consultation as a couple.",

      "title": "Πολυσεξουαλικότητα και ταυτότητες φύλου",
      "abstract": "Η «πολυσεξουαλικότητα» αποτελεί έναν συμπεριληπτικό όρο που περιγράφει άτομα τα οποία έλκονται ρομαντικά ή/και ερωτικά από παραπάνω του ενός (κοινωνικά) φύλα. Μέχρι πρόσφατα, η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία δεν είχε στρέψει ενεργά το ενδιαφέρον της προς αυτά τα άτομα, αν και αποτελούν τον μεγαλύτερο υποπληθυσμό της ΛΟΑΤΚΙΑ2+ κοινότητας. Τα υπάρχοντα δεδομένα υπογραμμίζουν ότι τα πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα αποτελούν έναν κοινωνικά στιγματισμένο πληθυσμό που έχει συνδεθεί με συγκεκριμένους μύθους και στερεότυπα. Παρουσιάζουν διαχρονικά χαμηλότερη ευεξία συγκρινόμενα με στρέιτ και γκέι άτομα. Ακόμα, αντιμετωπίζουν μοναδικές προκλήσεις, καθώς συχνά συνάπτουν ερωτικούς δεσμούς με άτομα διαφορετικών σεξουαλικών προσανατολισμών, οδηγώντας σε περίπλοκα και – μη επαρκώς ερευνημένα – σχεσιακά δυναμικά που επηρεάζονται από το φύλο και τον σεξουαλικό προσανατολισμό του συντρόφου. Επίσης, σε ατομικό επίπεδο, δεν έχει δοθεί έμφαση στη μέτρηση εξειδικευμένων ταυτοτικών πτυχών που ανταποκρίνονται στην πολυσεξουαλική εμπειρία. Επιπλέον, υπό το πρίσμα της Διαθεματικότητας, η ταυτότητα φύλου αποτελεί μια σημαντική πτυχή που οφείλεται να λαμβάνεται σοβαρά υπόψη για την πιο ολιστική αποτύπωση της ατομικής εμπειρίας αναφορικά με την κοινωνική καταπίεση και την ευεξία.Η παρούσα διατριβή αποτελείται από δύο Μέρη και ακολουθεί μεικτό ερευνητικό σχεδιασμό. Το Πρώτο μέρος, έχοντας ως συγκριτικό πλαίσιο 2507 στρέιτ άτομα, μελέτησε την ψυχική ευεξία 291 πολυσεξουαλικών ατόμων, λαμβάνοντας υπόψη το φύλο και τον σεξουαλικό προσανατολισμό του συντρόφου τους, αλλά και βασικές ψυχοσεξουαλικές ιδιότητες. Ακόμα, μελετήθηκε η σημασία της Ταυτότητας Κοινωνικού Φύλου (ΤΚΦ) στο συνολικό δείγμα των 2907 συμμετεχόντων. Τα αποτελέσματα ανέδειξαν σημαντικές διαφορές τόσο μεταξύ στρέιτ και πολυσεξουαλικού δείγματος σε επίπεδο ευεξίας και ψυχοσεξουαλικότητας, όσο και μεταξύ πολυσεξουαλικών ανδρών και γυναικών. Επίσης, αναδείχθηκαν συγκεκριμένες ψυχοσεξουαλικές ιδιότητες που εξηγούσαν σταθερά τις διαφορές ανάμεσα σε στρέιτ και πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα σε επίπεδο ευεξίας. Επιπλέον, το φύλο και ο σεξουαλικός προσανατολισμός του συντρόφου είχαν σημαντική επίδραση τόσο στην ευεξία όσο και στις ψυχοσεξουαλικές πτυχές των πολυσεξουαλικών συμμετεχόντων. Αναφορικά με τις ΤΚΦ, φάνηκε πως τα άτομα που βίωναν την ταυτότητα φύλου τους με έναν πιο ρευστό τρόπο, σημείωναν καλύτερους δείκτες ευεξίας και ψυχοσεξουαλικότητας. Όλα τα ευρήματα αναλύθηκαν κοινωνιοψυχολογικά και μέσα στο πλαίσιο της Θεωρίας του Μειονοτικού στρες και της Διαθεματικότητας. Το Δεύτερο μέρος εστίασε στην ανάγκη της ερευνητικής στροφής στις ιδιαίτερες πτυχές της πολυσεξουαλικότητας. Με βάση σύγχρονο θεωρητικό μοντέλο, δημιουργήθηκε μια νέα και εξειδικευμένη κλίμακα μέτρησης ταυτοτικών πτυχών, η οποία στοχεύει να επεκτείνει την υπάρχουσα σχετική βιβλιογραφία. Πραγματοποιήθηκαν τρεις Έρευνες, με συνολικό δείγμα 325 ενήλικα πολυσεξουαλικά άτομα. Τα αποτελέσματα επιβεβαίωσαν την παραγοντική δομή της Κλίμακας που αποτελείται από έξι διαστάσεις: (α) Διασταύρωση ταυτοτήτων/Συνολική ανάπτυξη, (β) Απόρριψη ταμπελών, (γ) Βρίσκοντας τη θέση στη ΛΟΑΤΚΙΑ2+ κοινότητα, (δ) Βρίσκοντας τη θέση στη στρέιτ κοινότητα, (ε) Απόρριψη μονοσεξουαλικής ταυτότητας και (στ) Κατανόηση της πολυσεξουαλικής ταυτότητας. Επιπλέον, ελέγχθηκαν και συγκεκριμένα ερευνητικά ερωτήματα αναφορικά με τις νέες αυτές ταυτοτικές πτυχές. Συνολικά, η παρούσα διατριβή συνεισφέρει πολύπλευρα στην υπάρχουσα γνώση, παρέχοντας νέα δεδομένα αναφορικά με την ευεξία, την ψυχοσεξουαλικότητα, τις στενές διαπροσωπικές σχέσεις και τις ιδιαίτερες ταυτοτικές πτυχές των πολυσεξουαλικών ατόμων. Ακόμα, ο τρόπος με τον οποίο τα άτομα βιώνουν το φύλο τους αναδεικνύεται ως κρίσιμος παράγοντας. Τέλος, πέραν των νέων ερευνητικών θεμάτων που ανακύπτουν από τα αποτελέσματα, παρέχονται και συγκεκριμένες κατευθύνσεις προς ψυχοθεραπευτική αξιοποίηση, κατά τη συνεργασία με πολυσεξουαλικό πληθυσμό.",

Various regularities are established: the lubrication is connected with difficulties in women with inflammatory changes in the internal sexual organs. The feeling of sexual excitation during sexual intercourse is stronger in women with larger number of sexual partners since the beginning of their sexual life. Disturbances in the occurrence of orgasm are more frequent in employees. Dyspareunia is connected mainly with organic changes in genitals, but it is determining factor for the success of sexual life. The frequency of the experienced pleasure is influenced by various social and biological factors comparatively slightly.",

In addition, the chapter introduces two other theoretical themes: sexual expression as a dyadic, rather than simply individual phenomenon, and the role of social networks in shaping sexual patterns. The result of the analyses suggest that adult sexual careers resemble a tree-like “global” structure, with key “local” structuring factors—physical health and sexual dysfunctions, partner availability and a partner's health, attitudes and beliefs regarding sex, and social embeddedness—entraining individuals along specific pathways. Apart from biological age, coming of age in more permissive times has a strong and enduring impact on one's sexuality, arguably due to the internalization of specific sexual templates or scripts.",

      "title": "Kościelny \"modus procedendi\" w przypadkach pedofilii",
      "abstract": "In ancient Greece and in the countries of the East paedophile activities were, generally, not prosecuted; they were considered to be normal sexual practices. The Church saw this issue differently and, from the very beginning, condemned paedophilia. The earliest Church documents bear witness to that: Didache (ca 100), St. Justin condemns it in his Apologia (ca 153), Synod of Elwira (305-306), Apostolic Constitutions (ca 380), Gratian’s Decretum (ca 1140), the third Lateran Council (1179), the fourth Lateran Council (1215), the Code of Canon Law of 1917, and the Code of Canon Law of 1983. Paedophilia is a sexual deviation when an adult experiences sexual gratification only in relations with children that have not yet developed secondary and tertiary sexual features. According to the International Classifications of Diseases ICD-10, and according to the classification of the American Psychological Association DSM-IV, paedophilia belongs to the disturbances of sexual preferences. Paedophilia may take various forms: with or without the physical contact, with or without the use of force, it can also take the form of child’s pornography. According to can. 1395,2 of the Code of Canon Law the following are the distinctive elements that make up the crime of paedophilia: a) the age of the victim (below the age of eighteen) b) t he sexual nature of the offense against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue; c) the perpetrator must be a cleric. The Church’s Modus Procedendi stipulates that in cases of the molesting of minors, in the light of the Code of Canon Law of 1983 and of the EPISTULA a Congregatione pro Doctrina Fidei missa ad totius Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopos aliosque Ordinarios et Hierarchas interesse habentes: DE DELICTIS GRAVIORIBUS eidem Congregationi pro Doctrina Fidei reservatis of 18th May 2001, the ecclesiastic superior must be notified of the likelihood of an offense having been committed. He conducts the preliminary investigation of which he, then, notifies the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having studied the findings of the preliminary investigation conducted by the ecclesiastic superior, issues him with an instruction as to the further proceedings. In the Church, the prosecution in cases of the molesting of minors terminates when ten years have lapsed since the victim came of age.",

      "abstract": "Violence may appear in a variety of contexts, such as private homes, public places, commercial spaces, colleges and universities, and other facilities1. It has a profound effect on people from all social classes. Because there was no standard term for violence, which made it a complicated and pervasive issue, it was not previously seen as a public health concern2. There is more to understanding violence than just tying it to empirical data. Instead, it entails making decisions about what constitutes proper and acceptable behaviour, which are influenced by societal norms, beliefs, and practices3. The deliberate use of force, real or threatened, towards themselves, another individual, an organisation or society, or oneself is what the World Health Organization, or WHO, defines as violence. This conduct has the risk of causing injury, death, psychological suffering, stunted growth, or impoverishment4. Although professional violence, including punching, kicking, shoving, hitting, shooting, and harming, has been acknowledged, until recently, little has been done to combat intellectual assault5. The intentional use of harm towards a person or group, including the threat or application of blunt force, is referred to as psychological abuse. The victim of this kind of assault may have detrimental effects on their psychological, ethical, moral, physical, and cognitive well-being6.",

This study focuses on female to male transsexuals (FTMs) who chose to bear a child, while being conscious of their transsexual male identity, and who therefore transitioned shortly afterwards. Problems this group have to face include: finding a supportive environment, defining their individual perception of masculine identity and handling the organisational aspects of transitioning. These consist of dealing with therapists and or medical caregivers who are required to write or approve the necessary referrals for name change, hormones or surgeries. Additionally meeting the standards legally required for a name/gender change can be complicated as these frequently request permanent sterilisation or a non‐marital status. Several FTMs who transitioned either during or after pregnancy (a maximum of three years afterwards) have been interviewed, particularly in respect to the response of their social environment. The request of permanent sterility for FTMs who wish to change their gender legally is discussed from a feminist and human rights perspective and from the male self‐perception of the FTMs involved in the study.",

      "title": "Approaching Your highest Sexual function in relationship: A reward of Age and maturity",
      "abstract": "A sexual act between two individuals is, by necessity, much more than a physical act. It involves a plethora of cognitions, emotions, and meanings that may facilitate or interfere with sexual behavior. When the two individuals in question are of the same sex, sexual interaction becomes a stigmatized behavior. Furthermore, when only one of the partners is infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), many issues related to health, medication, and risk of viral transmission come into play. In this chapter we focus on topics to be considered in the sex therapy of male couples of mixed (serodiscordant) HIV status. The psychotherapist who sees these couples in consultation may have to deal with specific sexual problems (e.g., diminished desire, erectile dysfunction, or premature or delayed ejaculation) that constitute the focus of the work. Yet, for the therapy to be successful—which we understand as a harmonious, negotiated, and mutually accepted resolution of the problems the couple brought to the consultation—it is essential that the therapist consider the wider context in which such sexual problems are embedded. We use verbatim quotes both from patients in our clinical practices with gay couples where one or both partners may be HIV-infected (Remien, Carballo-Diéguez, & Wagner, 1995; Remien, 1997; Remien, Wagner, Dolezal, & Carballo-Diéguez, 2003; Dolezal, Remien, Wagner, Carballo-Diéguez, & Hung, 2005) and from participants in behavioral research on sexual risk (Carballo-Diéguez & Bauermeister, 2004; Balan, Carballo-Diéguez, Ventuneac, & Remien, 2009) to illustrate some of the issues discussed.",

      "title": "Some Evidence Bearing on the Aim-Inhibition Hypothesis of Love",
      "abstract": "ONE OF THE more tenacious but, curiously, not very provacative issues centering around premarital sexuality concerns the consequences of coitus on established love relationships. Although sexual involvement between meaningful pair members is sometimes advocated in the folk culture, it is usually with the intent of precipitating a commitment for marriage; the generation of feelings of obligation and guilt, not love, become paramount. With respect to enhancing love, we find little encouragement for sexual activity. Quite to the contrary, our culture abounds with expressions admonishing the young, especially the female, of the unhappy consequences of premarital intercourse. Premarital concessions, she is warned, bring rejection and vitiates the love relationship. Generations of daughters have been cautioned that he won't love (respect) you anymore. This avenue of thought is by no means unique to the layman. Significant figures in sociology and psychology have also invested belief in the hypothesis that sexual intercourse corrupts love. Contemporary family writers, influenced by the works of Freud (1960) and Waller (1938), perpetuate with varying degrees of commitment the aim-inhibition hypothesis: romantic love is the consequence of sexual inaccessibility of the love object. Although a wide variety of explanations are offered concerning the psychological mechanics underlying this hypothesis, the central idea is essentially that romantic love is a subliminal phenomenon emerging from the social frustration of biological impulses. For our purposes, aim-inhibition is synonymous with the idea that romantic love and sex are incompatible, the dynamics accounting for that incompatibility being ignored. There has been a paucity of research on the consequences of sex on love in American society. The existent studies, however, do not support the aim-inhibition hypothesis (Burgess and Wallin, 1953:239-242; Kirkendall, 1961:chapter 8). For some of the more devout proponents of the hypothesis, the coup de grace has simply been the observation that romantic love tends not to survive long into marriage.' Efforts have also been exerted to bring anthropological materials to bear on this issue. These investigations have, at best, produced mixed evidence (Blood, 1952; Stephens, 1963:207; Chard, 1961). It is possible, moreover, that these cross-cultural studies have been aimed at a conceptually alien question, i.e., not whether the introduction of sexual intercourse vitiates love but rather do the two elements tend to co-exist on a societal level at any given time.

While there are no general indicators of ill health associated with masturbation, it can be powerfully negative or positive for many individuals. As an example, it is widely used in sex therapy as a means of improving the sexual health of the individual and/or relationship. Promoting masturbation as a means of a public health strategy for sexual health is highly controversial; however, there are arguments and evidence that suggest that this may be an important part of any public health approach to improving sexual health. There is a need for more research on the impact of masturbation on self-esteem, body image, sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction and methods for using masturbation to promote sexual health. There is also a need for more of a theoretical approach to the formation of hypotheses to be tested.",

Instead, representatives of the male gender of early adulthood are distinguished by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: traits of the male gender in achieving success, overcoming obstacles, helplessness, lack of externally regulated perfectionism, failure, lack of independence as a lack of result, understanding of the situation, reward for what has been achieved, duality of externally regulated perfectionism , affective-conative complex. Gender-based differences between the factors of axio-psychological projection in early adulthood have been revealed: in women, this process is motivated by the disposition of self-efficacy and perfectionist guidelines, and in men by masculinity traits and the desire to overcome obstacles.",

Symptoms evolved throughout adolescence and adulthood with persistent identity diffusion, intense abandonment fears, feelings of chronic emptiness and guilt, mood swings, unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity and self-destructive behaviour.

Uncertainty regarding male's role and identity diffusion, persisting since puberty. An impulsive decison for SRS and facial plastic surgery at the age of 40 (performed abroad), without a recommendation letter, motivated by the urge to resolve identity confusion and diminish compulsive sexual behaviour. He subsequently acknowledged his male identity, which led to relief of symptoms and request for sex-reconversion surgery. Gender history and clinical presentation confirmed that the patient did not sufficiently meet criteria for Gender Identity Disorder, but rather for Borderline Personality Disorder.

A study of 60 societies found that in high body contact cultures the infant is almost continuously carried out by the mother in the early months; little or no clothing separates the mother and infant; and infants sleep with their mothers at night. Low body contact cultures are characterized by separation of the infant from the mother at birth; swaddling or elaborate clothing; sleeping in a cradle or crib not with mother. Warmer climates are conducive to higher body contact. The means of food-getting will affect the infants diet and time of weaning. cultures with domesticated animals may wean a child to cow or goat milk sooner than cultures where hunting of nuts and berries provides hard to digest food. In close body-contact societies breast-feeding is frequent on demand unsupplemented for the first 6-12 months and lasts from 2-6 years. Nursing frequency is twice an hour or more. Modern societies require strict clothing on the women and swaddling on the child. Nursing frequency is less.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Fecal Incontinence",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION Fecal incontinence is defined as either the involuntary passage or the inability to control the discharge of fecal matter through the anus. Clinically there are three subtypes (a) passive incontinence—the involuntary discharge of stool or gas without awareness; (b) urge incontinence—the discharge of fecal matter in spite of active attempts to retain bowel contents, and (c) fecal seepage—the leakage of stool following otherwise normal evacuation. The severity of incontinence can range from the unintentional elimination of flatus to the seepage of liquid fecal matter or sometimes the complete evacuation of bowel contents. Not surprisingly, these events cause considerable embarrassment, which in turn can lead to a loss of self-esteem, social isolation, and a diminished quality of life (1). EPIDEMIOLOGY Although fecal incontinence affects people of all ages, its prevalence is disproportionally higher in women, in the elderly, and in nursing home residents. Estimates of its prevalence vary greatly and depend on the clinical setting, the influence of social stigma, the definition of incontinence, and the frequency of occurrence. In the U.S. householder survey, frequent leakage of stool or fecal staining for more than 1 month was reported by 7.1% and 0.7% of the population, respectively (2). In contrast, two or more episodes of fecal incontinence per month were reported by 0.8% of patients presenting to primary care clinics in the UK (3). In an elderly (>65 yr) self-caring population, fecal incontinence occurred at least once a week in 3.7% of subjects and in more men than women (men:women = 1.5:1) (4). In contrast, 25–35% of institutionalized patients (5) and 10–25% of hospitalized geriatric patients (6) suffer from fecal incontinence. In the United States, fecal incontinence is the second leading cause for placement in nursing homes (6). In a survey of 2,570 households, comprising 6,959 individuals, the prevalence of at least one episode of incontinence during the previous year was 2.2%; among these 63% were women, 30% were >65 yr of age, 36% were incontinent of solid stool, 54% of liquid stool, and 60% of flatus (7). Furthermore, in another prospective survey of patients attending either a gastroenterology or a primary care clinic, over 18% reported fecal incontinence at least once a week (8). Only one third had ever discussed the problem with a physician (8). When stratified for the frequency of episodes, 2.7% of patients reported daily incontinence, 4.5% weekly, and 7.1% once per month (8). In another survey, fecal incontinence was associated with urinary incontinence in 26% of women attending a Uro/Gyn Clinic (9). A higher incidence of mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was also reported in nursing home residents (10, 11). The cost of health care related to fecal incontinence includes items that can be measured such as the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of incontinence, medications, the use of disposable pads and other ancillary devices, skin care, and nursing care. Approximately $400 million/year were spent for adult diapers (8, 12) and between $1.5 and $7 billion/year were spent on care for incontinence among institutionalized elderly patients (6, 13). In a long-term facility, the annual cost for a patient with both mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was $9,711 (14). In the outpatient setting, the average cost per patient (including evaluation) was estimated at $17,166 (15). Additionally, there are other costs that cannot be measured such as the impaired quality of life and social dysfunction (1). SUMMARY. The prevalence of fecal incontinence ranges between 1% and 7.4% in otherwise healthy people and up to 25% in those who are institutionalized. Both the embarrassment and the social stigma attached to this disorder, often delay presentation as well as treatment for several years. Fecal incontinence not only causes significant morbidity in the community but it also consumes substantial health care resources. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Functional Anatomy and Physiology of the Anorectum The neuromuscular integrity of the rectum, anus, and the adjoining pelvic floor musculature helps to maintain normal fecal continence. The rectum is a muscular tube composed of a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle that interlaces with the underlying circular muscle. This unique muscle arrangement enables the rectum to serve both as a reservoir for stool and as a pump for emptying stool. The anus is a muscular tube 2–4 cm. long, which at rest forms an angle with the axis of the rectum. At rest, the anorectal angle is approximately 90 degrees, with voluntary squeeze it becomes more acute, approximately 70 degrees, and during defecation it becomes more obtuse, about 110–130 degrees. The anal sphincter consists of the internal anal sphincter, which is a 0.3–0.5 cm thick expansion of the circular smooth muscle layer of the rectum, and the external anal sphincter which is a 0.6–1 cm thick expansion of the striated levator ani muscles. Morphologically, both sphincters are separate and heterogeneous (16). The anus is normally closed by the tonic activity of the internal anal sphincter and this barrier is reinforced by the external anal sphincter during voluntary squeeze. The anal mucosal folds together with the expansile anal vascular cushions provide a tight seal. These mechanical barriers are augmented by the puborectalis muscle, which forms a flap-like valve that creates a forward pull and reinforces the anorectal angle to prevent incontinence (16). The anorectum is innervated by sensory, motor, and autonomic parasympathetic nerves as well as by the enteric nervous system. The principal nerve is the pudendal nerve, which arises from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves and innervates the external anal sphincter, the anal mucosa, and the anorectal wall. This is a mixed nerve and subserves both sensory and motor function (17). Its course through the pelvic floor makes it vulnerable to stretch injury, particularly during vaginal delivery. It is likely that rectal contents are periodically sensed by the process of \"ano rectal sampling\" (18, 19). This process may be facilitated by transient relaxations of the internal anal sphincter that allows the movement of stool or flatus from the rectum into the upper anal canal where they may come into contact with specialized sensory end organs such as the numerous Krause end-bulbs, Golgi–Mazzoni bodies and genital corpuscles and the relatively sparse Meissner's corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles (20). Specialized afferent nerves for touch, cold, tension, and friction subserve these organized nerve endings. An intact \"sampling reflex\" allows the individual to choose whether to discharge or retain their rectal contents, whereas an impaired \"sampling reflex\" may predispose to incontinence (19, 20). In contrast, the rectal epithilium shows no organized nerve endings (21). Myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are present adjacent to the rectal mucosa, the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. These subserve the sensation of distention and stretch and mediate the viscero-visceral, the rectoanal inhibitory, and contractile responses (22). The sensation of rectal distention travels along the parasympathetic system to S2, S3, and S4 (21). Thus, the sacral nerves are intimately involved with the sensory, motor, and autonomic function of the anorectum and in maintaining continence. Pathogenic Mechanisms and Etiology Incontinence occurs when one or more mechanisms that maintain continence are disrupted to an extent that other mechanisms are unable to compensate. Thus, the cause of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial (23–25). In a prospective study, 80% of patients had more than one pathogenic abnormality (23). In adult women, obstetric trauma is a major predisposing factor (26). This injury may involve either the external anal sphincter, the internal anal sphincter, or the pudendal nerves or all three structures. In prospective studies, nearly 35% of primiparous women (normal ante partum) showed evidence of sphincter disruption following vaginal delivery (26–28). Other important risk factors include forceps delivery, prolonged second stage of labor, large birth weight, and occipito-posterior presentation (29–31). Perineal tears, even when carefully repaired, can be associated with incontinence, and patients may either present immediately or several years following delivery (27). Other causes of anatomic disruption include iatrogenic factors such as anorectal surgery for hemorrhoids, fistulas, or fissures. Anal dilatation or lateral sphincterotomy may result in permanent incontinence due to fragmentation of the internal anal sphincter (32, 33). The internal anal sphincter is occasionally and inadvertently damaged during hemorrhoidectomy (34). Accidental perineal trauma or a pelvic fracture may also cause direct sphincter trauma leading to incontinence (35). In the absence of structural defects, internal anal sphincter dysfunction may occur because of a myopathy (36, 37), or internal sphincter degeneration (37), or a complication of radiotherapy (38, 39). Neurological diseases can affect continence by interfering with either sensory perception or motor function, or both. In the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, brain tumors, sedation, dorsal and spinal cord lesion may each cause incontinence (40–43). In the peripheral nervous system, cauda equina lesions, diabetic neuropathy (41, 44, 45), toxic neuropathy from alcohol, or traumatic neuropathy in the post partum setting may all lead to fecal incontinence. Up to 30% of patients with multiple sclerosis are incontinent (41). Skeletal muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and other myopathies can affect external anal sphincter and puborectalis function. Reconstructive procedures such as ileoanal (46) or coloanal pouches (47) can increase anorectal capacity and may improve continence. However, up to 40% of patients with an ileoanal pouch experience periodic, often nocturnal fecal incontinence, possibly related to uncoordinated pouch contractions (48). Similarly, rectal prolapse may be associated with fecal incontinence in up to 88% of cases (49–51). This is most likely due to prolonged inhibition of anal tone from intussusception of the rectum into the upper anal canal. Conditions that decrease rectal compliance and accommodation may also cause fecal incontinence (52). Etiologies include radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis, rectal inflammation secondary to ulcerative colitis (53, 54), or Crohn's disease and infiltration of the rectum by tumor, ischemia, or following radical hysterectomy (39). Rarely other causes include high intrarectal pressures generated in some patients with ulcerative colitis (53), or with severe voluminous diarrhea (55). In many patients fecal seepage or staining of undergarments is due to the incomplete evacuation of stool. A majority of these patients show obstructive or dyssynergic defecation (56). In these patients, anal sphincter and pudendal nerve function are intact but the ability to evacuate stool is impaired (56). Many also exhibit impaired rectal sensation (56, 57). Similarly, in the elderly and in children with functional incontinence, the prolonged retention of stool in the rectum leads to fecal impaction. Fecal impaction causes prolonged relaxation of the internal anal sphincter tone that allows liquid stool to flow around impacted stool and to escape through the anal canal (58). SUMMARY. Anal sphincter disruption or weakness, pudendal neuropathy, impaired anorectal sensation, impaired rectal accommodation, or incomplete evacuation may all contribute to the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence. These changes may be a consequence of local, anatomical, or systemic disorders. Thus, the origin of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Patients with fecal incontinence may be categorized into passive or urge incontinence or fecal seepage and their severity can be graded based on a prospective stool diary and clinical features. The evaluation of a patient with fecal incontinence involves a detailed clinical assessment together with the appropriate physiological and imaging tests of the anorectum. These three sources of information are complementary and should provide useful data regarding the severity of the problem, the underlying etiological factors, and the impact of the problem on the quality of life. Equipped with this knowledge, it is possible to design appropriate treatment strategies that could lead to clinical improvement. Clinical Features Many patients who suffer with fecal incontinence or soiling, take refuge under the term \"diarrhea\" or \"urgency\" (59). Thus, the first step in the evaluation is to establish a rapport with the patient and to confirm the existence of fecal incontinence. Thereafter, further characterization is desirable. This can include an assessment of its duration, its progression, its nature, i.e., incontinence of flatus, liquid stool, or solid stool, and its impact on the quality of life (Table 1). The use of pads or other devices and the ability to discriminate between formed or unformed stool and gas should be enquired. A detailed inquiry should also include obstetric history, a history of coexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pelvic radiation, neurological problems or spinal cord injury, dietary history, and a history of coexisting urinary incontinence. Also, during clinical assessment, it is useful to ask if a patient can differentiate between formed and unformed stool or flatus, i.e., the presence of rectoanal agnosia. A prospective stool diary may also be very useful (Fig. 1).Table 1: A List of Important Information That Should be Elicited When Taking a History in a Patient with Suspected Fecal IncontinenceFigure 1: A sample stool diary for assessing patients with fecal incontinence. Use the following descriptors for describing stool consistency: Type 1: Separate hard lumps. Type 2: Sausage shaped but lumpy. Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface. Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft. Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily). Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool. Type 7: Watery.The circumstances under which incontinence occurs should also be determined. Such a detailed inquiry may facilitate the identification of the following possible scenarios: Passive incontinence—which is the involuntary discharge of fecal matter or flatus without any awareness. This suggests a loss of perception and/or impaired rectoanal reflexes either with or without sphincter dysfunction. Urge incontinence—which is the discharge of fecal matter or flatus in spite of active attempts to retain these contents. Here, there is a predominant disruption of the sphincter function or the rectal capacity to retain stool. Fecal seepage—which is the undesired leakage of stool, often after a bowel movement with otherwise normal continence and evacuation. This condition is mostly due to incomplete evacuation of stool and/or impaired rectal sensation (56, 58). The sphincter function and pudendal nerve function are mostly intact (56, 57). Although there is an overlap between these three groups, by making a clinical distinction, it is possible to assess the underlying etiology and to guide investigations and management. Symptom assessment can also provide useful insights regarding the underlying mechanism(s), but may not correlate well with manometric findings. In one study, leakage had a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 11%, and a positive predictive value of 51% for detecting low resting anal sphincter pressures (31). The positive predictive value for detecting a low squeeze pressure was 80% (31). Thus, for an individual patient with incontinence, history and clinical features alone are insufficient to define the pathophysiology and therefore objective testing is essential. Nevertheless, based on the clinical features, several grading systems have been proposed. Recently, a modification of the Cleveland Clinic grading system (60) has been validated by the St. Mark's investigators (61). This system can provide an objective method of quantifying the degree of incontinence. It can also be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapy. This grading system is based on seven parameters that include whether the anal discharge is either solid, liquid or flatus, and whether the problem causes alterations in lifestyle, (scores: Never = 0, Always = 5); the need to wear a pad or the need to take antidiarrheal medication, and the ability to defer defecation (scores: No—0, yes—2). The score ranges from 0 (continent) to 24 (severe incontinence). Clinical features alone are, however, insufficient to define the pathophysiology. The use of validated questionnaires such as the SCL-90R SF-36 may provide additional information regarding the psychosocial issues and impact on the quality of or life. Physical Examination This should include a detailed physical and neurological examination of the back and the lower limbs, because incontinence may be secondary to a systemic or a neurological disorder. The perineal inspection and digital rectal examination is best performed with the patient lying in the left lateral position and with good illumination. Upon inspection, the presence of fecal matter, prolapsed hemorrhoids, dermatitis, scars, skin excoriation, the absence of perianal creases, or a gaping anus may be noted. These features suggest either sphincter weakness or chronic skin irritation and provide clues regarding the underlying etiology. Excessive perineal descent or rectal prolapse can be demonstrated by asking the patient to attempt defecation. An outward bulge that exceeds 3 cm is usually defined as excessive perineal descent (62). The perianal sensation should also be checked. The anocutaneous reflex examines the integrity of the connection between the sensory nerves and the skin, the intermediate neurons in the spinal cord segments S2, S3, and S4, and the motor innervation of the external anal sphincter. This can be assessed by gently stroking the perianal skin with a cotton bud in each of the perianal quadrants. The normal response consists of a brisk contraction of the external anal sphincter. Impaired or absent anocutaneous reflex suggests either afferent or efferent neuronal injury (63). Digital Rectal Examination Recommendation: Digital rectal examination can identify patients with fecal impaction and overflow. It is not accurate enough for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction or for initiating therapy. After inserting a lubricated, gloved index finger, one should assess the resting sphincter tone, the length of the anal canal, the integrity of the puborectalis sling, the acuteness of the anorectal angle, the strength of the anal muscle, and the elevation of the perineum during voluntary squeeze. Also, the presence of a rectocele or impacted stools may be noted. Unlike the examination of other organs, one should exercise considerable sensitivity and allay any fears when performing a digital rectal examination. The accuracy of digital rectal examination—as an objective test for evaluating anal sphincter function—has been assessed in several studies. In one study of 66 patients, digital examination by an experienced surgeon was somewhat correlated with resting sphincter pressure (r = 0.56; p < 0.001) or maximum squeeze pressure (r = 0.72: p < 0.001) (64). In another study of 280 patients with several anorectal disorders, a reasonable correlation was reported between digital palpation and manometry (65). However, the sensitivity, the specificity, and the positive predictive value of the digital exam were very low (65). By the digital exam, the positive predictive value of detecting a low sphincter tone was 66.7% and a low squeeze tone was 81% (31). In another study of 64 patients, the agreement between digital examination and resting anal canal pressure or squeeze pressure was 0.41 and 0.52, respectively (66). These data suggest that digital examination is only an approximation, which is influenced by many factors including the size of the examiner's finger, the technique, and the cooperation of the patient. Thus, it is not very reliable and is prone to interobserver differences.Table 2: Treatment of Fecal IncontinenceINVESTIGATIONS OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Endoscopic evaluation of the rectosigmoid region is appropriate for detecting mucosal disease or neoplasia that may contribute to fecal incontinence. At the outset it is important to distinguish whether the incontinence is either secondary to diarrhea or independent of stool consistency. If there is coexisting diarrhea, a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed to exclude colonic mucosal inflammation, a rectal mass, or stricture. Stool studies, including stool screening for infection, stool volume, stool osmolality and electrolytes may be performed. Similarly, biochemical tests may reveal thyroid dysfunction, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Breath tests may reveal lactose or fructose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth (24). Several specific tests are available for defining the underlying mechanisms of fecal incontinence (23, 52, 63, 67). These tests are often complementary (23, 52, 63, 67). The most useful tests are anorectal manometry, anal endosonography, balloon expulsion test and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (23, 52, 63, 67). A description of these tests and others that are commonly used for the evaluation of fecal incontinence and their clinical significance has been discussed in detail by Diamant et al. (67). Hence, a brief description of these tests and their clinical relevance is presented here with particular emphasis on recent literature and contentious issues. Anorectal Manometry and Sensory Testing Recommendation: Anorectal manometry with rectal sensory testing is the preferred method for defining the functional weakness of the external or internal anal sphincter and for detecting abnormal rectal sensation. Measurement of rectal compliance (reservoir function) may be helpful in some patients. These tests may also facilitate biofeedback training. Anorectal manometry provides an objective assessment of anal sphincter pressures together with an assessment of rectal sensation, rectoanal reflexes, and rectal compliance. Currently, several types of probes and pressure-recording devices are available. Each system has distinct advantages and drawbacks (63, 68, 69). A water-perfused probe with multiple closely spaced sensors is commonly used (63, 69). Alternatively, a solid-state probe with micro-transducers may be used (63, 69). Although more expensive and fragile, they do not require perfusion equipment, are easier to calibrate, and are possibly more accurate (63, 68). The anal sphincter pressures can be measured by stationary, station pull-through, or rapid pull-through techniques, but the former two are probably more accurate (63, 67, 68). A rapid pull-through technique can give falsely high sphincter pressures (67, 70). The resting anal sphincter pressure predominantly represents the internal anal sphincter function and the voluntary squeeze anal pressure predominantly measures the external anal sphincter function. Patients with incontinence have been shown to have low resting and low squeeze sphincter pressures (65, 71, 72). The duration of the sustained squeeze pressure provides an index of sphincter muscle fatigue. The ability of the external anal sphincter to contract in a reflex manner can also be assessed during abrupt increases of intraabdominal pressure such as when coughing (25, 63, 68, 69). This reflex response causes the anal sphincter pressure to rise above that of the rectal pressure to preserve continence. The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. In patients with spinal cord lesions above the conus medullaris, this reflex response is present but the voluntary squeeze may be absent, whereas in patients with lesions of the cauda equina or sacral plexus both the reflex response and the voluntary squeeze response are absent (63, 73, 75). The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. Sensory Testing Rectal balloon distention with either air or water can be used for the assessment of both the sensory responses and the compliance of the rectal wall. By distending a balloon in the rectum with incremental volumes, it is possible to assess the thresholds for first perception, a first desire or an urgent desire to defecate (25, 52, 63, 68, 69). A higher threshold for sensory perception suggests impaired rectal sensation (23, 25, 41, 52, 71). Also, the balloon volume required for partial or complete inhibition of anal sphincter tone can be assessed. It has been shown that the volume required to induce reflex anal relaxation was lower in incontinent patients than controls (71, 74). Because sampling of rectal contents by the anal mucosa may play an important role in maintaining continence (18, 19), quantitative assessment of anal perception using either electrical (22) or thermal (22, 76) stimulation has been advocated. In one study, anal mucosal sensation was assessed by recording perception threshold for electrical stimulation of the mid anal canal using a ring electrode (77). A combined sensory and motor defect was seen in patients with incontinence (77). In another study, although anal canal perception was impaired immediately after a vaginal delivery, there was no difference at 6 months (78). The role of thermosensitivity appears controversial (22). In one study, the ability of healthy anal mucosa to differentiate between small changes in temperature has been questioned (79). Hence, under normal conditions it is not possible to appreciate the temperature of fecal matter passing from the rectum to the anal canal during sampling (79). Whether patients have a pure sensory defect of anus without coexisting sphincter dysfunction or rectal sensory impairment has not been shown. In contrast, a combined sensory and motor defect has been reported in many studies (77, 78, 80). Rectal compliance can be calculated by assessing the changes in rectal pressure during balloon distention with air or fluid (41, 44, 52, 67, 68). The ratio dv/dp describes the relationship. Rectal compliance is reduced in patients with colitis (53, 54) and in patients with low spinal cord lesions and in diabetics with incontinence (41, 44, 52). In contrast, compliance is increased in high spinal cord lesion (42, 75). When performed meticulously, anorectal manometry can provide useful information regarding anorectal function (23, 52, 67, 80). A technical review recommended the use of anorectal manometry for the evaluation of patients with incontinence because it can define the functional weakness of one or both sphincters and helps to perform and evaluate the responses to biofeedback training (67). Unfortunately, to date there has been no uniform technique or equipment for performing anorectal manometry (81). Also, there is a dearth of normative data and uniform methods of interpreting test results. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop standards of testing anorectal function and to validate the significance of abnormal results. Recently, the American Motility Society has initiated an international collaborative effort to develop standards for manometry testing and a consensus document has been published (82). Such efforts may lead to standardization of testing and interpretation of anorectal manometry. Although there are insufficient data regarding normal values, overlap among healthy subjects and patients with incontinence (65, 67), and large confidence intervals in studies that have examined test reproducibility (64, 83), for the individual patient with incontinence, manometry testing can be very useful. Manometric tests of anorectal function may also be useful in assessing objective improvement following drug therapy (84), biofeedback therapy (85), or surgery (86). Imaging the Anal Canal Recommendation: Anal endosonography is the simplest, most widely available and least expensive test for defining structural defects of the anal sphincter and should be considered in patients with suspected fecal incontinence. ANAL ENDOSONOGRAPHY. Traditionally, anal endosonography has been performed using a 7 mHz rotating transducer with a focal length of 1–4 cm (87). It provides an assessment of the thickness and structural integrity of the external and internal anal sphincter muscle and can detect the presence of scarring, loss of muscle tissue, and other local pathology (87, 88). More recently, higher frequency (10–15 mHz) probes that provide better delineation of the sphincter complex have become available (89). After vaginal delivery, anal endosonography has revealed occult sphincter injury in 35% of primipara women and most of these lesions were not detected clinically (27). In another study, sphincter defects were detected in 85% of women with third-degree perineal tear compared with 33% of subjects without tears (28). In studies that compared EMG mapping with anal endosonography, there was a high concordance rate for identifying sphincter defects using both modalities (90, 91). The technique is, however, operator dependent and requires both training and experience (67). Although endosonography can distinguish an internal sphincter injury from that of an external sphincter injury, it has a low specificity for demonstrating the etiology of fecal incontinence (92). Because anal endosonography is more widely available, is less expensive, and is certainly less painful than needle insertion, currently, it is the preferred technique for examining the",

      "title": "Personality and Sexual Adjustment",
      "abstract": "In view of the considerable importance attached to sexual adjustment by many psychologists and psychiatrists, it is disappointing that very little work seems in fact to have been done in this field. There are, it is true, surveys of ‘normal’ sexual behaviour, such as those associated with Kinsey, but these are characterized on the whole by the serious limitation of using entirely descriptive statistics; these are useful in a limited sense, but are not very informative. The value of a mean of 2 · 34 for the number of times that members of a given sample indulge in intercourse during the week is doubtful when it is realized that some members of the sample have intercourse once or twice a year, while others have it several times a night; even if one could take the unaided recall of such events very seriously, and even if the rate for a given person were less fluctuating than it probably is, nevertheless when variances are as large as these means have little meaning or relevance. Clearly the important question centres on quite a different problem, namely that of personality traits and other factors giving rise to these very marked individual differences in sexual behaviour and adjustment. Kinsey and his followers have concentrated on the factors of social class and age, perhaps because these are relatively easy to ascertain; it is not so easy to ascertain the psychological factors involved, as many critics of Kinsey's work have pointed out. Nor have psychiatrists, in spite of their professional interest in this field, been more forthcoming; apart from isolated statements about the lower fertility of psychotics, the loss of libido in depression, its excess in manic states, and the widespread sexual troubles of neurotics, little serious and detailed work appears to have been done to relate personality traits, or even descriptive diagnostic labels, to specific types of sexual behaviour. Psychologists have been equally remiss; apart from a few undistinguished and not very meaningful studies reviewed by the writer (Eysenck, 1971) little use has been made of the well-established research methodologies and psychometric tests available to them for use in such a situation.",

      "title": "Dignity in the Discourses of Bioethics",
      "abstract": "The language of “human dignity” features prominently in seminal documents in the human rights literature, in a variety of recent declarations and conventions, in many traditional and more recent statements from religious bodies and working groups, and in bioethics writings of the past several decades (Cochrane 2009; Davis 2008; Schmidt 2006). Appeals to human dignity have buttressed arguments on a wide range of particular bioethics topics, often from quite diverse perspectives—from debates about “appropriate” forms of conception (e.g., techniques of assisted reproduction, surrogate parenting, and reproductive cloning) or about the moral status of nascent forms of human life (e.g., the use of embryonic stem cells and fetal tissue) to questions about appropriate decision making at the end of life (e.g., the status of particular interventions, especially artificial nutrition and hydration; judgments about treatment for patients in persistent vegetative state; and issues of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide). Perhaps less prominently, or implicitly rather than explicitly, notions of human dignity also inform discussions of allocation and triage, undergirded by judgments about what constitutes a “natural life span” (Callahan 1995) or the implications of a “prudential life span account” for health care trade-offs (Daniels 1985). In addition, human dignity has been emphasized as a central value in several reports by George W. Bush's Council on Bioethics, especially during the tenure of Leon Kass as its chair, as well as in Kass's own writings on biotechnology, enhancement, and human cloning (see Kass 2002; President's Council 2002, 2008).Clearly, then, in bioethics and elsewhere, we do not lack for rhetorical examples of human dignity as an appeal. But if the concept is rhetorically familiar, its apparent richness often seems to complicate rather than to clarify arguments, with end-of-life decision making a particularly powerful example of such complexity. Claims of human dignity are asserted from opposing sides with dramatically different meanings and substantive commitments. It is, apparently, no accident that Oregon's statute on physician-assisted suicide is labeled the “Death with Dignity Act,” because the dignity ascribed to such a choice is linked directly to claims about extending the ambit of autonomy from a competent patient's right to refuse unwanted treatment to his or her right to physician assistance in suicide, primarily for reasons of controlling the circumstances and timing of death. Alternatively, recent Roman Catholic teaching on so-called life issues judges assisted suicide and euthanasia to be fundamental violations of human dignity (see John Paul II 1995, 18), because in the Catholic tradition autonomy is both legitimated and constrained by broader judgments about the intrinsic immorality of the direct taking of innocent human life.More broadly, dignity appears to vary in its stringency or weight as a moral appeal depending on sociocultural and institutional differences. Dignity has featured prominently as an independent factor in a number of European Court judgments, on matters ranging from the “indignity of public dwarf-tossing” as entertainment, despite the consent of the dwarf being tossed (United Nations Human Rights Committee 2007, 111–14), to German cases that affirm “human dignity” as “an attribute of unborn human life” at all stages of development, (Constitutional Court [1993] 2012, 203) in contrast to the absence of that ascription in U.S. court decisions since the time of Roe v. Wade.Whether one looks, then, at specific debates within a particular society or at the interpretive standards at work in different cultural and jurisprudential traditions, dignity emerges as a contested notion. For some analysts, despite its apparent imprecision, it functions usefully as a cluster or umbrella term meant to constellate core features of our shared anthropology—including intuitions about the distinctive nature of human beings and the choices and actions that comport, or fail to comport, with that status. Leon Kass, for example, invokes the language of dignity to capture a holistic vision that emerges as greater than the sum of its parts. For Kass, appeals to dignity involve both rationality and virtue, both natural sentiment and inculcated sensibility, both moral perspicacity and intuitive judgment. Moreover, for Kass, concerns about dignity are often negatively encountered when confronted by certain long-standing taboos (e.g., cannibalism or disrespect for cadavers) or unsettling prospects for the human future (e.g., reproductive cloning or genetic enhancement). Both retrospectively and prospectively, Kass (1997) often appeals to what he calls the “wisdom of repugnance,” which invariably functions as a prediscursive visceral reaction to actions and practices that he deems deeply violative of human dignity.For critics, however, appeals to dignity fail to illuminate debates in any way that is distinctive or useful. Ruth Macklin, in a widely cited article, contends that “dignity is a useless concept. It means no more than respect for persons or their autonomy.” In her judgment, “appeals to dignity are either vague restatements of other, more precise notions or mere slogans that add nothing to the understanding of the topic” (2003, 1419). In a similar though more strident vein, Stephen Pinker speaks of the “stupidity” of dignity, labeling it a “squishy, subjective notion, hardly up to the heavyweight moral demands assigned to it” (2008, 28).In light of the deeply contested status of dignity as a legal and moral value, it is interesting to return to Jim Childress's “Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?” In the article, Childress appeals straightforwardly to the dignity of persons as a central element. In developing his arguments, Childress recommends mechanisms of randomness and chance among a pool of medically eligible candidates for scarce resources because such procedures maintain “a significant degree of personal dignity by providing equality of opportunity” (1997, 176). Elaborating further, Childress concludes that “the individual's personal and transcendent dignity, which on the utilitarian approach would be submerged in his social role and function, can be protected by a recognition of his equal right to be saved” (176).Childress's appeal to dignity in “Who Shall Live?” is interesting not only because of recent debates among other bioethicists about the cogency of the term but also because of the reservations Childress himself has expressed about the usefulness of dignity in subsequent writings and public testimony. A few such examples will suffice to make the point. In the recent seventh edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics, Childress and coauthor Tom Beauchamp offer only brief comments in passing about the concept. When discussing human dignity as a property that confers moral status, they describe it as “a very unclear notion that moral theory has done little to clarify” (Beauchamp and Childress 2012, 65). In their discussion of quality-of-life criteria in the context of end-of-life care, they acknowledge that “the vagueness surrounding terms such as dignity and meaningful life is a cause for concern” (172). In 2005 testimony before the President's Council, Childress cautions against “over-inflationary and over-extended uses of the concept.” And in a recent essay concerning the implications of controversies about human dignity for biotechnology issues, he concludes that “in public bioethics, at least in the US, HD [i.e., human dignity] is loosely used, overused, and overextended. As a result, it functions more to obfuscate than to illuminate bioethical debates” (2010, 28).For many years, Childress has held leadership and consultative positions on various policy commissions and task forces. That rare blend of scholarly precision and “real world” engagement has provided him a distinctive blend of experience and insight that informs his understanding of practical reasoning in bioethics and his recognition of the legitimate place, as well as the constraints upon, the invocation of epistemologically privileged appeals as the justificatory basis of public policy. In that light, Childress (2010) has recently observed that dignity functions both as an aretic standard (of human excellence and flourishing) and as a standard of specifiable rights and duties, with the latter use far more relevant to policy deliberations. Indeed, as a standard of rights and duties, the moral and legal force of dignity emerges as coterminous with enforceable claims of respect for persons and their autonomy that hold a central place in bioethics, in human rights more generally, and in recent American jurisprudence.Childress's preference for interpreting dignity as a standard for specified rights and duties in policy discourse is in keeping with his acknowledgment (perhaps even celebration) of pluralism. That preference appears to underlie his reservations about the usefulness of particular aretic depictions of dignity as a justificatory standard for pluralistic policy. At the same time, Childress does not dismiss the value of particular perspectives on dignity as potentially relevant contributions to the broader context of policy discussion and formation. In his discussion of policy ethics, Childress has appealed to John Rawls's notion of “overlapping consensus” as the appropriate basis for invoking dignity as a standard for specified rights and duties. Consequently, Childress would not exclude distinctive, even parochial, perspectives on dignity from the larger public conversation. For example, in relation to biotechnology discussions, he has recently observed that “it is quite legitimate for religious and other groups to articulate their visions about [human dignity] in public bioethics” (2010, 37).If one supports, then, as Childress does, a legitimate function in public bioethics for epistemologically privileged perspectives on dignity, it is important to emphasize two aspects of that inclusiveness. First, quite often the claims of particular communities, especially religious ones, can be justified in more general and broadly shared terms. Shared moral and legal conclusions on particular issues and common policy conclusions are possible (perhaps at times even likely) despite lack of agreement about first or foundational principles. Second, efforts to disqualify the claims of particular communities from public policy debates confuse the process of public discussion and debate, where the views of particular communities may exercise legitimate influence, with the warrants for and justification of policy choices, where merely parochial appeals are inappropriate.Given Childress's preference for interpreting dignity as a standard of rights and duties in public policy setting, I want to turn, albeit briefly, to the broader history of its usage, in effect to “open up” the term to its own complexity. By doing so, I hope to suggest that dignity, though functioning effectively as a rights standard, need not thereby be reduced (at least without significant remainder) solely to that function.In a modest but important recent volume, political philosopher Michael Rosen (2012) has analyzed the various substantive meanings of dignity as a descriptive and normative concept. Several of his observations about the meanings of dignity across the centuries support the conclusion that beyond its value as a standard of rights and duties, dignity continues to capture penumbral associations not reducible to that function. Rosen's precision in drawing distinctions among the different substantive meanings of dignity is helpful. Indeed, by attending to several distinct meanings of dignity, we can better appreciate why dignity often emerges as a vague or unhelpful concept when its different senses are confused or conflated. Such confusions may arise for various reasons, including the following: (1) un(der)examined assumptions about shared substantive understandings of moral agents (e.g., questions of moral status involving judgments about the scope of dignity protections); (2) un(der)examined assumptions about shared evaluations of moral actions (the variability of traditions and cultures about what constitutes dignified and undignified choices and actions); (3) even when perspectives on dignity are shared, un(der)examined assumptions about the appropriate warrants to be invoked in making such judgments (distinctions to be drawn between morality and legality in general terms and about the meanings of and motivations for so-called public rationality); (4) un(der)examined assumptions about the range and composition of the audience to whom such appeals may be directed (e.g., the status of putatively universal epistemological claims, such as natural law directives in Catholic arguments, versus postmodern rejection of such shared perspectives); and (5) un(der)examined assumptions about fundamental distinctions to be drawn between different modes of moral discourse and their degrees of authority and bindingness.As Rosen demonstrates, the language of dignity has a long historical pedigree. Its emergence and early use predates our post-Kantian understandings of personal autonomy or of human rights as enforceable individual (or group) claims. On the one hand, classical appeals to dignity were invoked as status-related claims, with dignity denoting high social standing and the duty of respect from others due on that basis. Oftentimes, the terms dignity and honor were invoked in similar ways to capture this rather elitist conception of dignity as an attribute of social status and the behaviors and virtues appropriate to such status. In this sense, claims to dignity were clearly nonegalitarian; they comported with Greek and Roman hierarchical conceptions about different classes of human beings naturally suited for their roles, with attendant duties and responsibilities.Yet even within such a hierarchically driven ascription of dignity, one finds a second strain in some of the classical literature, especially in certain works of Cicero (De Officiis, cited in Rosen 2012, 11–12), where dignity is imputed to all human beings by virtue of their shared differences from lower animals and their standing in the natural or cosmic order. This second emphasis did not in itself exclude the ascription of specific duties and “dignities” in the social hierarchy, but one finds hints even here of the movement from a classical language of natural jus (the right) to a language of natural rights, as recounted in compelling detail by Brian Tierney (2001). Moreover, such affirmations of human dignity are enriched and amplified in the foundational texts of the Abrahamic faiths, where human dignity is affirmed as an inherent feature of our shared creaturehood as persons made “in the image” of God (Schulman 2008, 8).As a third pre-Kantian thread, dignity is also invoked to describe (and prescribe) certain forms of respect-worthy behavior. One can identify a plethora of examples of this sort, ranging from classical discussions of arete to medieval perspectives on duty (e.g., The Book of the Courtier), and from Renaissance conceptions of the nobility or excellence of humanistic learning (see, for example, Erasmus) to Francis Bacon's praise for the “dignity” of science as an especially worthy calling. In such examples, and countless others, one finds a reaffirmation of long-standing classical themes about forms of excellence in arts, education, and performance now being linked to notions of appropriate human engagement with the larger world. Such dignified behavior is often discussed in terms of virtue and character, as in keeping either with role-related duties or with the distinctive ontological status of humanity at large, in other words, the dignity of human beings.1Rosen's analysis is far richer than this brief review suggests. But even the preceding summary paragraphs reveal separate (or separable) strands of meaning and application to dignity as a concept. The cogency of appeals to dignity, then, in bioethics and elsewhere, will require us to disambiguate the separable strands at work in particular discussions. And all such efforts must be made in light of the pivotal place of dignity in Kant's writings, especially his Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals. In that work, Kant asserts the linchpin of his thought: “Hence morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, is that which alone has dignity” (1998, 4:434–35). This is both an intensification and a restriction of earlier understandings of dignity. In classical thought, the concept of dignity functions within a hierarchical worldview, one that accepts the appropriateness of social inequality, and hierarchy also characterizes theologically framed medieval understandings. For example, within Aquinas's theology of creation, many things have dignity or value, as appropriately ordered constituents of God's good creation. Neither of these “natural” hierarchies appears in Kant's discussion, because he deems dignity to be solely an attribute of human beings, based on their rational nature and their capacity for self-legislation according to the moral law. Human persons (at least those who have attained such rational capacity) share a distinctively human and inalienable value.Modern interpreters of Kant often tend to conflate the recent emphasis on respect for personal autonomy (in bioethics and elsewhere) with Kant's own formulation, in ways that allow them to overlook, ignore, or minimize central aspects of his understanding. We should not make light of the differences between Kant's perspective on autonomy and our own. For Kant, autonomy as self-rule is inextricably linked to his account of the moral law. Thus, his discussion of the categorical imperative both empowers and constrains particular choices (with suicide an example of the latter) in ways that modern voluntarist readers of Kant will find unconvincing. Yet Kass, too, hardly a voluntarist, criticizes Kant's account of dignity for the “largely formal” notion of personhood on which it rests. For Kass, Kant's discussion of dignity is, “in an important respect, inhuman. Precisely because it dualistically sets up the concept of ‘personhood’ in opposition to nature and the body, it fails to do justice to the concrete reality of our embodied lives” (2008, 313). This reading, while perhaps formally accurate, fails to acknowledge those dimensions of Kant's discussion that result in specific behavioral prohibitions. Moreover, Kass's negative judgment is in keeping with his own effort to depict dignity as an aretic standard that is of little or no importance to Kant's categorical project.According to Kass, the value of dignity emerges from “the worthiness of embodied human life, and therewith our natural desires and passions, our natural origins and attachments, our sentiments and repugnances, our loves and longings” (313–14). By invoking dignity in such robust fashion, however, Kass fails to heed two problematic aspects of his own formulation. First, appeals to nature, including the shared human nature central to Kass's arguments, are rightly criticized for their admixture of description and prescription. The difficulties of moving from is to ought are well known. Thus, Kass's claims about “embodied” dignity as a basis for rejecting reproductive cloning or genetic enhancement fail to provide the missing bridgework, despite their eloquence (see Kass 1997; President's Council 2002). Moreover, the possessive plural that features prominently in Kass's many writings about the “brave new world” that may await us—our nature, our embodiment, our loves, our longings—depends for its force, perhaps ironically, on an older status-based or aretic understanding of dignity rather than Kant's far more egalitarian formulation. Kass, with noble rhetoric, speaks for “us” in a manner that seemingly must conflict with the current sociopolitical realities of pluralism and the economic realities of markets and consumerism. One (though not all, surely) may bemoan the dehumanizing tendencies at work in such social and political realities; but one need not require deeply shared intuitions to make that case. Kant's own rather formal account of dignity and personhood may, in fact, do that job well enough.In addition to Rosen's historical account, a second way of appreciating the various meanings of dignity is to consider, in something of Wittgensteinian fashion, the ways that dignity functions in different modes of discourse. As James Gustafson (1990) reminds us, moral discourse functions in a number of ways. He distinguishes four modes of moral discourse—what he calls ethical, prophetic, narrative, and policy discourse. Each mode, he argues, is necessary for the deliberations of particular communities or for society at large, but none is of itself sufficient.These days, of course, Gustafson's mode of ethical discourse may be the most familiar to us—the language of norms, principles, rights and duties, and theoretical appeals to deontology and consequentialism. Such discourse is crucial: it serves to frame our reflections as we justify choices in a pluralistic society where a common narrative cannot be assumed. Prophetic discourse, by contrast, is often passionate in its sweeping indictment of larger cultural trends and social sins. Such discourse tends to make up in vision what it lacks in precision. It challenges us to notice the forest through the trees, to acknowledge those large-scale background features that the ethical mode in the foreground often tends to miss. The discourse of narrative is the language of story, the story that shapes a particular community. Narrative is not the language of argument, of precise moral reasoning, of premises and conclusions. Narrative is more full blooded, less skeletal. The bare bones of argument so dear to secular philosophers are covered with the flesh and blood of tradition. Narrative is, first and foremost, about inspiration, about the formation of character. We are shaped by the stories we tell. Finally, for Gustafson, we have policy discourse, the realm of particular interest to Childress in much of his recent writing. Policy discourse, rather than focusing on ideal theories or grand conceptions, usually functions within the constraints of history and culture. It works with the values already embedded in the choices that we have made. It is seldom, if ever, prophetic; its horizon is limited. It generally asks not “What is the good or the right choice?” but within a range of acceptable alternatives, “What is the reasonably good and feasible choice?”As I noted earlier, in contrast to critics of dignity, Childress acknowledges a legitimate place for religious and other groups to bring their particular perspectives to the public square. In a recent chapter, he offers two instructive examples of such contributions; they “may include, for instance, efforts to broaden the ordinary scope of [human dignity] to include embryos and the human species.” They may also “include visions of human excellence and flourishing beyond human rights/duties” (2010, 37–38). In light of Childress's examples, it may be useful to speculate a bit more broadly on the various modes of “dignity discourse” according to Gustafson's categories. The ethical and policy modes of dignity are clearly represented in the history of modern bioethics. The success of dignity as a standard of specified rights and duties is obvious in the history of modern bioethics, particularly its emphasis on patients' rights to make treatment decisions free of the medical paternalism of an earlier era and in the protection of human research subjects. Dignity as a standard of rights also has relevance to broader debates about the right to health care. As we noted earlier, the appeal to “personal and transcendent” dignity plays an important justificatory role in Childress's discussion in “Who Shall Live?” Such examples can be multiplied many times over; they attest to the vitality of dignity as a standard of specified rights and duties. But that success invites again Macklin's sort of criticism. Is dignity coterminous with specified rights and duties? Does dignity add something, do something, beyond such specification? If so, what? How does dignity function as an additional, or perhaps at times countervailing, value?One answer, of course, is to acknowledge, as Childress does, the invocation of dignity as an aretic standard. As such, dignity often is a central feature of the formative stories, practices, and rituals of particular communities on grounds that may be uniquely their own. In these settings, dignity may not be reducible to its function as a pluralistic justificatory standard for policy purposes, especially when individual choices are constrained by a particular axiology. Gustafson's narrative and prophetic modes emerge as better designations for the invocation of dignity in such contexts.Nonetheless, beyond their functions for particular communities, are there ways that Gustafson's categories of narrative and prophetic dignity might contribute to public policy ethics in distinctive fashion? It is difficult to be precise here (which may serve to reinforce Childress's preference for dignity as a standard of specified rights and duties), but a few general points are in order. In overview, it seems obvious that different sorts of both justification and legitimation will function differently in different contexts, with different audiences, and with different epistemological and moral warrants. As we've seen, in some institutional settings and interpretive traditions, the language of dignity cannot be reduced, without significant qualification, to Macklin's replacement of dignity with respect for persons and their autonomy. Kant's understanding of autonomy both justifies and constrains certain moral choices, including the choice to end one's life. Roman Catholic appeals to personal dignity arise within an axiological framework that shapes judgments about the legitimacy (and illegitimacy) of various choices, especially those concerning abortion, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. In some respects, then, Macklin's effort at reductionism emerges as more “Millean” than Kantian; her apparent denial of the value or relevance of alternative, often more restrictive, interpretations of dignity comports with her secular philosophical commitments. Alternative perspectives on dignity, addressed authoritatively to particular interpretive communities, will reserve significant space for further specification of what dignity requires, including legitimate constraints on “merely” self-regarding choices.Yet that “parochial” point may seem to confirm Macklin's dismissal yet again, since she denies a publicly accessible meaning to the language of dignity beyond its specification in terms of rights and duties. One obvious response to Macklin's critique would be to broaden the focus of our analysis, to point out the far more substantial role for dignity as a separate and countervailing value to claims of autonomy in other cultures and traditions of jurisprudence. For example, the Basic Law in Germany has been interpreted by several courts to limit the exercise of self-regarding autonomy with conclusions clearly at odds with Macklin's reductionism (Rosen 2012, 77–80).More broadly, numerous national constitutions, international declarations, and international conventions specifically appeal to dignity as a substantive value in its own right. The Preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “the peoples of the United Nations have … reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, [and] in the dignity and worth of the human persons,” suggesting by that compound object that dignity and rights are not, or need not, be conceptually coterminous. Article 1 of the Declaration adopts the same compound formulation: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights” (emphasis added). In reviewing a wide range of such documents, Charles Foster concludes that “there are few significant international, regional, or national human rights charters that do not rely explicitly on dignity” (2011, 86). Hence, before accepting Macklin's charge of redundancy, one would need to develop, in effect, a series of Venn diagrams depicting various traditions of jurisprudence in order to draw firm conclusions about the areas of substantive overlap and separation between dignity and specific rights claims. That sort of review of the literature is beyond the compass of this article, but the findings of several studies (see Foster 2011; Rao 2011) suggest that Macklin's conclusion, if it is to be accepted, will be accurate only as applied to limited jurisdictions.In the United States, it is generally true that recent liberal theory has accorded priority to the right over the good. In Rawlsian conceptions of justice as fairness, the influence of “comprehensive” worldviews (whether individual or communal) in formulating warrants for pluralistic policy has been seen as problematic. On the one hand, Rawls' justificatory criteria appear to require the translation of epistemologically privileged insights into widely accessible “public reasons” as the warrants that undergrid policy choices. On the other hand, a broader account of public reasoning may be undercut by efforts to focus exclusively on such publicly shared reasons, in ways that may minimize the potential contributions of Gustafson's several modes of dignity discourse to the public conversation.I would argue, however, that a procedural commitment to the priority of the right over the good and to the requirements of public reason need not lead to moral minimalism in our public debates. More pointedly, attention to the different ways that dignity is deployed may allow us to identify various points of influence and leverage in public bioethics. As I close, then, let me suggest several ways that the value of dignity may be extended beyond its admittedly successful role as a standard of specific rights and duties.At the most general level, human dignity may serve as something of a shorthand term for a cluster of shared intuitions about human flourishing, broadly conceived. The sorts of notions I have in mind here will be less detailed than Kass's discussion of dignity as an aretic standard. Nor will they be as exhaustive as the “capabilities” account of what justice requires developed by Martha Nussbaum (2011) or Amartya Sen (1999), although there may well be some overlap between their approaches and the intuitions I am seeking to identify. Intuitions about human flourishing are at work, even if prediscursively, in the urgency we bring to our formulations of specific rights and duties. Such intuitions, if spelled out with greater substance, may help to enlarge the scope of our reflections in critiquing, amending, or extending the underlying logic of current rights to new or broader areas of application. At a minimum, the sort of intuitions I have in mind may function as the underacknowledged normative background for various standards already in the law—for example, the scope of the “best interest” standard when applied to those who lack decision-making capacity, or the scope of a “reasonable person” standard as it functions in judicial reasoning. The range of such applicability may well be broad, but not perniciously so. Indeed, such standards appear to require a certain shared understand of human flourishing in order for them to be interpreted and applied.I remain uncomfortably aware of the challenge that Macklin's dismissal of dignity poses to efforts at greater precision, and I am equally aware of the problems that beset intuitionism as a systematic moral epistemology. What I have in mind for the meaningfulness of dignity is more modest than a full-throated recourse to intuitionism but also less reductionstic than Macklin's effort to reduce dignity without conceptual remainder to specified rights and duties. Indeed, I might suggest that dignity, as an intuitive appeal in this prediscursive sense, may in fact emerge as an important feature of the “common morality” Beauchamp and Childress identify as the vital source of our considered judgments (2012, 410–24). If so, then dignity, rather than being a redundant or extraneous value, may provide a distinctive take on two sorts of discussions—one of human rights more broadly, the second of issues in bioethics proper.As we have seen, Macklin's own translation of dignity into respect for persons and their rights describes the general arc of American jurisprudence but fails to capture the various ways that dignity is deployed across different legal and cultural traditions. One might, of course, in the face of that variability, agree with Macklin in dismissing the relevance of dignity as a practicable value. Alternatively, one might cite that variability as broad evidence that “the concept of human dignity, in virtue of its purchase on universality, serves as a common currency of transnational judicial dialogue … in matters of human rights” (Carozza 2008, 932). To judge which of those interpretations is more accurate, one would need to examine in exhaustive detail legal judgments across many jurisdictions. In preferring the second interpretation, I tend to view the concept of dignity as the fundamental grounding of rights claims of all sorts. Indeed, were human dignity not fundamental to specific rights claims, one would appear to lack an answer to the following question: Granted that respect for persons and their autonomy are shared norms, why should human persons be able to claim or be accorded these rights in the first place?Lest that sort of query seem an idle one, it can be brought to bear on specific sorts of bioethics topics. As we have seen, many areas of clinical and research bioethics are better illuminated by specified norms, rights, and duties than by the broad, often inchoate appeal to dignity. Nonetheless, in light of Courtney Campbell's article in this issue, there may be important symbolic and expressive dimensions to the language of dignity that remain relevant to certain issues. Such debates might focus on genetic enhancement or on human-machine incorporation technologies. They might engage questions about the moral status of new hybrid forms of life, including human-animal chimeras. They might involve broader speculations about the place of biotechnology in altering or transcending “human nature,” itself a quite contentious term, or about the promises and perils of the “transhuman” or “post-human” future. This type of discussion will necessarily be speculative, its relevance to policy unclear. At the same time, when human dignity is included as a feature in such debates, it resists being easily translated into, or reduced to, current notions of rights and duties. Indeed, in these contexts, the appeal to dignity would seem to challenge us, despite our reservations as postmodernists, to engage in something closer to metaphysical speculation.Given the predominance of Gustafson's ethical and policy modes of discourse in much of recent bioethics, that quasi-metaphysical turn may prove unsettling in several ways. It may ask us to reconsider the ways such “deeper” questions will be invited into our policy discussions, despite the canons of public reason. It may ask us to reconsider the status of symbolic, expressive, and narrative features of our common life as we seek to develop a broader notion of “overlapping consensus” than that at work in the legal paradigm that tends to dominate much of bioethics. And it may confront us with an ongoing challenge to our roles as active citizens in a pluralistic policy. Despite the constraints of the liberal neutrality principle, appeals to moral intuition, moral vision, and moral imagination remain relevant features of our pluralistic discourse. Many of the issues that confront us in bioethics underscore the need for at least a modest renewal of a collective moral language, a language of the common good that allows policy space to voice broader, less easily specifiable concerns. With some effort, we should be able to identify affinities, and perhaps even functional parallels, between religious and secular arguments on conflicted issues (Lustig 2001).Finally, in fleshing out more robustly various aspects of human dignity, particular communities, employing prophetic and narrative discourse, may be able to enrich our common life and our public conversations. Much of recent liberal theory has had difficulty accounting for our sense of “natural” duties as central features of moral life and experience. Communitarian thought has sought to incorporate such duties by distinguishing between autonomy as a minimal or abstract claim and the conditions of what might be called “effective autonomy” (see Etzioni 1996). By so doing, it seeks to “flesh out” the existential and social requirements of rights and duties as current claims. It also invites us to extend the moral logic at work in current commitments to their fuller expression and exercise by individuals and communities in the future, as suggested by Joel Feinberg's useful language of “manifesto rights.”2 In these various ways, dignity may yet provide a corrective to the tendencies toward moral minimalism or myopia that some critics (e.g., Callahan 1981; Taylor 1989) find far too prevalent in our public debates.3",

They are intelligent, gifted and usually untroubled by the variations of their sexual drives, or the occasional fleeting interest in people of their own sex. Their femininity, only faintly noticeable to others, is as a rule well integrated and often put to good use in their professional lives. On the debit side, although they are capable of fairly lasting and deeply satisfying relationships with women, we find a high divorce rate and frequent changes of partners. Some of them can be exceptionally promiscuous, exploiting their capacity to attract women in a wholly effortless manner. Their promiscuity has a striking oral quality, in so far as they give the impression of being sexually insatiable, thus confirming the psychoanalytic observation of the equation penis=mouth. Many of them are little affected by an orgasmic incompetence which is hidden by a reasonable sexual performance. All these men are incapable of a full homosexual contact, though some have experimented with boys in childhood or early adolescence, but never intensely.",

All three dimensions of RSB are subjected to influence by several factors – biomedical, psycho-socio-cultural and interpersonal.

      "title": "Approach to the Patient: Transgender Youth: Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Compelling studies have demonstrated that \"gender identity\"--a person's inner sense of self as male, female, or occasionally a category other than male or female--is not simply a psychosocial construct, but likely reflects a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors. An increasing number of preadolescents and adolescents, identifying as \"transgender\" (a transient or persistent identification with a gender different from their \"natal gender\"--ie, the gender that is assumed based on the physical sex characteristics present at birth), are seeking medical services to enable the development of physical characteristics consistent with their affirmed gender. Such services, including the use of agents to block endogenous puberty at Tanner stage 2 and subsequent use of cross-sex hormones, are based on longitudinal studies demonstrating that those individuals who were first identified as gender-dysphoric in early or middle childhood and who still meet the mental health criteria for being transgender at early puberty are likely to be transgender as adults. Furthermore, onset of puberty in transgender youth is often accompanied by increased \"gender dysphoria\"--clinically significant distress related to the incongruence between one's affirmed gender and one's \"assigned (or natal) gender.\" Studies have shown that such distress may be ameliorated by a \"gender-affirming\" model of care. Although endocrinologists are familiar with concerns surrounding gender identity in patients with disorders of sex development, many providers are unfamiliar with the approach to the evaluation and management of transgender youth without a disorder of sex development. The goals of this article are to review studies that shed light on the biological underpinnings of gender identity, the epidemiology and natural history of transgenderism, current clinical practice guidelines for transgender youth, and limitations and challenges to optimal care. Prospective cohort studies focused on long-term safety and efficacy are needed to optimize medical and mental health care for transgender youth.",

El sistema hetero – patriarcal transmitido de generacion en generacion dentro del ambito familiar, contribuye en la prevalencia de actitudes, conductas, comportamientos y conocimientos que no permiten aceptar la diversidad sexual de los individuos (homosexuales, bisexuales, otros). De esta forma se han generalizado fenomenos especificos tales como: la represion, la disfuncionalidad familiar, el machismo, la homofobia y la misoginia. En el ambito religioso consideran a la homosexualidad como un pecado y una practica antinatural, bajo la creencia que la sexualidad es especialmente para la reproduccion y procreacion. Anulando el placer mutuo; en lo laboral las empresas publicas y privadas buscan una imagen corporativa con caracteristicas fisicas como hombre (masculino) o mujer (femenino), considerando un desprestigio para la misma, tener personal homosexual; debido a esto y a otros factores una persona homosexual es constantemente menospreciada, objeto de burla, tema de comentario, descalificacion y muchas veces son directamente maltratados fisica y psicologicamente, a la vez ha generado el desempleo masivo en homosexuales.

      "title": "Classic genetic and hormonal switches during fetal sex development and beyond",
      "abstract": "Abstract Critical genetic and hormonal switches characterize fetal sex development in humans. They are decisive for gonadal sex determination and subsequent differentiation of the genital and somatic sex phenotype. Only at the first glace these switches seem to behave like the dual 0 and 1 system in computer sciences and lead invariably to either typically male or female phenotypes. More recent data indicate that this model is insufficient. In addition, in case of distinct mutations, many of these switches may act variably, causing a functional continuum of alterations of gene functions and -dosages, enzymatic activities, sex hormone levels, and sex hormone sensitivity, giving rise to a broad clinical spectrum of biological differences of sex development (DSD) and potentially diversity of genital and somatic sex phenotypes. The gonadal anlage is initially a bipotential organ that can develop either into a testis or an ovary. Sex-determining region Y (SRY) is the most important upstream switch of gonadal sex determination inducing SOX9 further downstream, leading to testicular Sertoli cell differentiation and the repression of ovarian pathways. If SRY is absent (virtually “switched off”), e. g., in 46,XX females, RSPO1, WNT4, FOXL2 , and other factors repress the male pathway and promote ovarian development. Testosterone and its more potent derivative, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as well as AMH, are the most important upstream hormonal switches in phenotypic sex differentiation. Masculinization of the genitalia, i. e., external genital midline fusion forming the scrotum, growth of the genital tubercle, and Wolffian duct development, occurs in response to testosterone synthesized by steroidogenic cells in the testis. Müllerian ducts will not develop into a uterus and fallopian tubes in males due to Anti-Müllerian-Hormone (AMH) produced by the Sertoli cells. The functionality of these two hormone-dependent switches is ensured by their corresponding receptors, the intracellular androgen receptor (AR) and the transmembrane AMH type II receptor. The absence of high testosterone and high AMH is crucial for anatomically female genital development during fetal life. Recent technological advances, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, will likely shed more light on the nature of these molecular switches.",

It is not surprising then that one of the key questions that has enthralled behavioural endocrinologists and social scientists, in almost equal amounts, concerns that of sexual determination/differentiation – how genes initially determine sex, and then how a variety of factors (principally hormonal) cause the sexes to differentiate in terms of their morphology, physiology and, most controversially perhaps, behaviour and psychology. From a psychological perspective, the study of such sexual differentiation in relation to cognition, personality, mood, etc. has formed major research topics that even now are dogged by controversy, hyperbole and downright sensationalism.",

For men, any cue designed to activate a short-term or a long-term mating goal increased creative displays; however, women displayed more creativity only when primed to attract a high-quality long-term mate. These creative boosts were unrelated to increased effort on creative tasks or to changes in mood or arousal. Furthermore, results were unaffected by the application of monetary incentives for creativity. These findings align with the view that creative displays in both sexes may be linked to sexual selection, qualified by unique exigencies of human parental investment.",

      "title": "Hypersexuality Addiction and Withdrawal: Phenomenology, Neurogenetics and Epigenetics",
      "abstract": "Hypersexuality has been defined as abnormally increased sexual activity. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that this non-paraphilic condition consists of \"excessive\" sexual behaviors and disorders accompanied by personal distress and social and medical morbidity. It is a very controversial and political topic in terms of how best to categorize it as similar or not similar to addictive behaviors including substance abuse. Hypersexual disorder is conceptualized as a non-paraphilic sexual desire disorder with impulsivity. Pathophysiological perspectives include dysregulation of sexual arousal and desire, sexual impulsivity, and sexual compulsivity. The nucleus accumbens, situated within the ventral striatum, mediates the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, and food as well as music. Indeed, it is believed that this structure mandates behaviors elicited by incentive stimuli. These behaviors include natural rewards like feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion. An essential rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. Here, we are hypothesizing that there is a common mechanism of action (MOA) for the powerful effects drugs, music, food, and sex have on human motivation. The human drive for the three necessary motivational behaviors \"hunger, thirst, and sex\" may all have common molecular genetic antecedents that, if impaired, lead to aberrant behaviors. We hypothesize that based on a plethora of scientific support hypersexual activity is indeed like drugs, food, and music that activate brain mesolimbic reward circuitry. Moreover, dopaminergic gene and possibly other candidate neurotransmitter-related gene polymorphisms affect both hedonic and anhedonic behavioral outcomes. There is little known about both the genetics and epigenetics of hypersexuality in the current literature. However, we anticipate that future studies based on assessments with clinical instruments combined with genotyping of sex addicts will provide evidence for specific clustering of sexual typologies with polymorphic associations. There have been some studies using electrophysiological techniques that do not support the view that hypersexuality is indeed similar to substance abuse and other behavioral addictions. The authors are also encouraging both clinical and academic scientists to embark on research using neuroimaging tools to examine natural dopaminergic agonistic agents targeting specific gene polymorphisms to \"normalize\" hypersexual behavior.",

Hypotheses about the cause (or causes) of such behavior have ranged widely, from organic-genetic theories to the intrapsychic or interpersonal formulations proposed by psychosocially oriented therapists. These latter formulations, when applied to male homosexuality, have included such factors as unresolved oedipal problems, castration anxiety, fear of heterosexuality, fear of women, identification with the female, role confusion, and the problem of dependency.<sup>1,2</sup> There has been an increasing and presumably more sophisticated tendency to ascribe homosexual behavior to any one, or a combination, of these factors, rather than to insist upon a unitary hypothesis, eg, that all homosexual behavior is motivated by castration anxiety, or that all such behavior is an expression of psychic masochism.

But what about immoral thoughts, more specifically, thoughts that violate religious beliefs? Do heretical thoughts taint the purity of mind? The present research examined heretical disgust using self-report measures and facial electromyography. Religious thought violations consistently elicited both self-reported disgust and anger. Feelings of disgust also predicted harsh moral judgement, independent of anger, and were mediated by feelings of \"contamination\". However, religious thought violations were not associated with a disgust facial expression (i.e., levator labii muscle activity) that was elicited by physically disgusting stimuli. We conclude that people (especially more religious people) do feel disgust in response to heretical thoughts that is meaningfully distinct from anger as a moral emotion. However, heretical disgust is not embodied in a physical disgust response. Rather, disgust has a symbolic moral value that marks heretical thoughts as harmful and aversive.",

      "abstract": "-Unacceptable Behaviours - Says Who? Cures: The Good Fuck and Pull Up Your Socks. Doctors and Hospital. And Patriarchy.Anger, illness, and self-harming are deviations not only from health (i.e. soundness of bod_y and mind) but also from normalcy (i.e. what is seen as acceptable behaviours of body and mind). They are physical manifestations closely related what is generally called madness. And clearly, as Matthews explains,Any and all behaviour can be called mad, depending upon social context, values held by and relationship of power between judge and judged. Even in case of medical profession, which alone can legitimately and conclusively diagnose or define person as mad, each doctor's is subjective, inevitably biased according her or his age, sex, class position, etc; and in so far as is made of behaviour alone, it is inevitably about what ought be.1That moral judgement renders subject's behaviour (men and women alike) unacceptable, even if assertion that the medical profession alone can legitimately and conclusively diagnose or define person as mad remains extremely doubtful. Nevertheless, female characters studied here are all mad, from standpoint of reason - they behave 'mad', although they are not really ill: there are no organic signs that something is wrong; there are no lesions, no viruses, no lumps.Following Michel Foucault, I argue that women's bodies are signs that women are controlled. When these signs become visible, women are labelled deviant. Forms of female deviance, such as those described here, are socially constructed states that symbolize both hegemony of scientific medicine and Victorian social constraints on women.2 Thus inscription of pain on female body and killing of babies are signifiers of female protest against patriarchal oppression, and form of feminist politics of action-reaction. Female characters inscribe on their bodies suffering they cannot speak. As French psychoanalyst Jacques Salome affirms, What cannot be spoken must be suffered.3Madness is label applied those who deviate from acceptable and accepted norm. The suffering and pain that female characters in works of fiction I am looking at endure are normal - hence acceptable - as long as they alone suffer, as long as no label of is stamped on sufferer. When baby is murdered or life is too obviously in danger, society intervenes - doctors are brought in, tablets are dispensed, women are locked in hospitals, strapped their beds sometimes, and 'cured'. There is no denying that to label of madness is a method of control over women.4 The 'cure' is often control over woman's body, sometimes over her spirit, too.Anger - drive of many harmful activity performed by female characters - is also often labelled deviant, pathological, and unfeminine. The social resonance of anger in women is telling. In Western, Judaeo-Christian cultures, woman is regarded as an angel, as result of centuries of biblical/religious conditioning. And an angel does not get angry, otherwise it (she?) becomes devil, like Lucifer in Old Testament. Therefore an angry woman is devil. Anger is not acceptable - - in woman. Crump further explains:Women are further inhibited from expression of anger by requirement live out behaviours of woman, and nice lady rather than being perceived as unfeminine or bitch. (2)This is manifest in texts considered here. The social need for woman appear a good woman/nice lady/angel shapes expression of woman's anger in same way as phrases 'a boy does not cry/whimper/play with dolls' shape male social behaviour. Women are allowed (supposed?) use passive-aggressive forms of anger expression, such as pouting, whining, manipulating, backbiting, or gossiping,5 though this is what Crump clearly identifies as myth derived from lack of scientific knowledge. …",

Some infants—among them good feeders—may refuse food when a meal is delayed, or give other signs of a disturbance in the relation to the mother. The author observes that young infants—even as early as in the second month—would in wakeful periods after feeding lie on the mother's lap, look up at her, listen to her voice and respond to it by their facial expression; it was like a loving conversation between mother and baby. Such behaviour implies that gratification is as much related to the object which gives the food as to the food itself. A very slow taking of food often implies lack of enjoyment of libidinal gratification; this, if coupled with an early and marked interest in the mother and in other people, suggests that object-relations are partly used as an escape from persecutory anxiety attaching to food.",

It is defined as a hostile act that poses a threat to another creature. It is exhibited in many ways, including threatening body movements, vocalization, fighting, wounding and inflicting pain, sexual attack, and killing. Commonly, animals act aggressively to exclude others from their territory, to capture food, or to control populations. Displays of aggression are influenced by age (newborns and infants below a certain age do not show aggression), by the physical environment, by previous social experience, and by the aggression level in a particular community. One manifestation of aggression is infanticide—the killing of infants by adults. It occurs in several species of animal. Human infanticide is practiced in several cultures to control population, to favor the birth of a particular sex (usually male), and in waging war. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, biologists reported anecdotal observations of infanticide in both male and female wild animals.",

      "title": "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual behavior is ubiquitous and diverse. Beyond the sex act itself, sexuality permeates our culture and our daily lives. Therefore, as with all of the behavioral disorders, distinguishing “normal” from “abnormal” sexuality can be difficult. For example, there are no bright lines separating “low” sexual desire from “normal” sexual desire, or “premature” ejaculation from “normal” ejaculation. Whether a person even is bothered by a particular aspect of his or her sexuality is significantly influenced by personality, previous developmental experience, extent of education about sex, satisfaction with one’s relationships in general, and surrounding cultural attitudes about sex. Consider premature ejaculation. DSM-IV defines this as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration, and before the person wishes it. The definition is deliberately subjective, taking into account the quality of the individual’s sexual relationship. Paradoxically, this subjective definition may be more reliable and valid than a definition based on the exact interval between penetration and ejaculation as measured by a stopwatch. Thus, while a man who ejaculates within a minute of vaginal entry might be considered by some people to be “premature,” if he and his wife engage in a half-hour of very pleasurable foreplay, followed by mutual orgasms after a minute of pleasurable intercourse, he could not be considered to have a sexual “dys function.”",

In some respects, the most surprising aspect of the scientific study of sex is the fact that it has taken place at all, that theories have been formulated and tested, and that empirical data have accumulated in a rapidly accelerating fashion over the last century. Human sexuality may be interwoven with love and many other splendored things or with hate and other totally nonsplendored things, but in either event it also remains a matter of some quite specific physical structures and functions. If biosexology can be characterized as emphasizing the similarities across species and among individuals, sociosexology takes a different conceptual set and emphasizes the differences.

      "abstract": "Commonly debated in the public sector as well as in academic circles and scientific research, the basic concepts of the phenomenon of sexual orientation are being confused or simply recognized inadequately. This especially affects the conceptual understanding of sexual behaviour, sexual orientation, but also sexual identification and sexual identity. Homosexual behaviour does not have to correspond to or be the cause of homosexual orientation. Homosexual behaviour may not necessarily be an indication of homosexual orientation. Homosexual orientation has deeper biological roots than homosexual behaviour, which, in humans, is strongly influenced by culture. The phenomenon of sexual orientation does not have to be perceived as a positively dichotomous occurrence anymore. Quite the opposite, it seems it is a continuum of various sexual orientations that can have their own specific biological and socio-cultural roots. The psychological concept of the sexual identi­fication process suggests there can be a discrepancy between the psychological and the biological aspect of a single phenomenon, a discrepancy between sexual orientation [with no regard to behaviour] and sexual identification. The second part of the article seeks to outline the complex issue of gender conformity and nonconformity, which is closely related to the topic of homosexual orientation and, furthermore, is significantly overshadowed hy numerous 'popular myths', common among laymen. ln gender nonconformity we distinguish between Childhood Gender Nonconformity [CGN] appearing before puberty and Continuous Gender Identity [CGI]. Childhood gender nonconformity is one of the most common [although not completely accurate] predictors of future homosexual orientation. As far as the 'popular myths' connected withthis issue are concerned, the most widespread yet overly simplified idea is that every homosexually oriented male is positioned nearer to the feminine end of the masculinity-femininity scale. The article aims to illustrate that the problem is in reality more complex: actually, it is possible to distinguish more types of male homosexual orientation.",

      "title": "A Research Note on Incest",
      "abstract": "Incest occurs not infrequently in Sweden among agricultural laborers of low cultural standard and within a similarly disorganized group of industrial laborers. A sociological investigation into the causes of violation of the usually very stringet incest taboo reveals the importance of the typical life-history in these social strata, showing a unique configuration of circumstances. Home is usually left at a very early age; broken homes, psychological tension between the parents, and frequency of child labor tend to minimize the educational influences. The occupational life shows a frequency of change of jobs and even occupations. A declining trend in the occupational career will be observed at the inception of incestuous behavior. Sometime before the beginning of the incestuous relationship between father and daughter the routine of everyday life suffers and interruption from such a cause as accident, economic trouble, or disease. In almost all cases of father-daughter-incest-by far the most frequent type-the father suffers extreme sexual frustation, having been refused sexual intercourse with his wife. These different instances of the life-history have to be integrated into a comprehensive conception of the social attitudes of the patient. Thus, incest is regarded as due to indifference toward social responsibilities and coinciding with an extreme frustation of the sexual drive.",

      "abstract": "Methodological reductionism has served biology well, but its problems in the study of behaviour include turning open systems into closed ones, defining the units of analysis, and interpreting correlative and causal relationships between processes studied within different biological discourses, from molecular biology to psychology The problems become more acute when methodological becomes philosophical reductionism, with its declared goal of collapsing 'higher level' explanations into 'lower level' ones. Quite apart from the vexed question of what constitutes a 'level', relevant behavioural phenomena may only be manifest at such higher levels. The reductionist programme assumes that parts have ontological and possibly historical (developmental, evolutionary) primacy over wholes, yet the nature of living systems is such that this cannot be the case. I will exemplify these problems in the context of the study of behaviour. But the worst problem arises when reductionism becomes an ideology, especially in the context of human behaviour, when it makes the claims to explain complex social phenomena (e.g. violence, alcoholism, the gender division of labour or sexual orientation) in terms of disordered molecular biology or genes. In doing so, ideological reductionism manifests a cascade of errors in method and logic: reification, arbitrary agglomeration, improper quantification, confusion of statistical artefact with biological reality, spurious localization and misplaced causality.",

      "abstract": "Loss of desire for sexual activity is the commonest presenting\n\nfemale sexual dysfunction and often the hardest to treat. Whether this loss of sexual desire should be seen as abnormal or simply as a variation of normal has long been debated. Much literature is available on female loss of desire, considering sexuality for women from various angles. The American PsychiatricAssociation's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), which gives our working classification of psychosexual dysfunction, would classify it as hypoactive sexual desire disorder and sexual aversion disorder.\n\nMasters and Johnson's original “human sexual response curve” helps us to understand loss of desire in the context of the normal sexual response. This diagrammatic representation describes increasing sexual pleasure against time —(desire for sexual activity followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution. It is important to remember, however, that the physiologies of desire, arousal, and orgasm are separate entities and therefore are not dependent on each other. Women with loss of desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder) can have good sexual functioning. In essence, they will not initiate sexual contact.\n\n\n\nThe normal female sexual response. (Adapted from Masters WH, Johnson VE. Human sexual response. Boston, MA: Little, Brown, 1966)\n\n\n\nIs desire a thought or a feeling? The answer is not clear, and, certainly early in loving relationships, physical arousal closely follows any sexual thought. Initially, we have a sexual thought, which then facilitates the arousal mechanism through neurological pathways. The thought could be anticipation of the evening ahead or a memory of a previous sexual encounter. Women who do not desire sexual activity can operate quite well sexually once engaged in the sexual encounter. Touch around the clitoris and genital area facilitates neurological pathways, producing good arousal, good lubrication, and on to orgasm.\n\nMuch research into sexual desire is being undertaken, but …",

      "abstract": "Einleitung Ess- und Körperbildstörungen werden gesellschaftlich und wurden lange in der Forschung als Störungen dünner, weißer, wohlhabender Mädchen betrachtet. Dagegen entwickelte sich in den letzten Jahren ein zunehmendes Bewusstsein für Diversität als Forschungsdimension. So ergeben sich – überwiegend aus dem US-amerikanischen Raum – belastbare Hinweise auf erhöhte Prävalenzraten in sexuellen und geschlechtlichen Minderheitengruppen. Mit soziokulturellen Theorien, Minderheitenstressmodell und Objektifizierungstheorie bestehen Rahmenkonzepte, die spezifische Einflussfaktoren auf Körperbild und Essverhalten in diesen Personengruppen annehmen. Diese Theorien sind bislang wenig integriert und zu den Einflüssen einzelner Faktoren wie bspw. community involvement oder Prozessen der (Selbst-) Objektifizierung ergeben sich widersprüchliche Befunde. Zudem wird das Körperbild häufig auf einzelne Komponenten reduziert oder unidimensional (Schlankheit oder Muskularität) konzeptualisiert. Schließlich existiert insgesamt eine geringere Zahl diversitätssensitiver Untersuchungen aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum. Das vorgestellte Projekt erfasst mit Gender und sexueller Orientierung daher zwei Aspekte von Diversität und begreift Körperbild als multidimensionales Konstrukt. Neben der Erfassung von Gruppenunterschieden soll unter Zusammenschau obiger Theorien der Beitrag einzelner Faktoren zur körperbildbezogenen Unzufriedenheit und Modifikationsverhaltensweisen bei LGBTQ- und hetero-cis-Personen untersucht werden.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Gender has been the focus of linguistic and psychological studies, but little is known about its conceptual representation. We investigate whether the conceptual structure of gender – as expressed in participants’ free-listing responses – varies according to gender-related experiences in line with research on conceptual flexibility. Specifically, we tested groups that varied by gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender-normativity. We found that different people stressed distinct aspects of the concept. For example, normative individuals mainly relied on a bigenderist conception (e.g., male/female; man/woman), while non-normative individuals produced more aspects related to social context (e.g., queer, fluidity, construction). At a broader level, our results support the idea that gender is a multifaceted and flexible concept, constituted by social, biological, cultural, and linguistic components. Importantly, the meaning of gender is not exhausted by the classical dichotomy opposing sex, a biological fact, with gender as its cultural counterpart. Instead, both aspects are differentially salient depending on specific life experiences.",

      "abstract": "El presente artículo tiene como propósito general reflexionar acerca del consentimiento sexual desde la perspectiva psicoanalítica de los estudios de género y los aportes de las ciencias sociales. Para ello se analizan los encuentros vinculares heterosexuales, para luego proponer algunas contribuciones que faciliten la igualdad sustantiva y la responsabilidad afectivo/sexual. El consentimiento sexual supone un acuerdo para participar en una actividad sexual compartida. Para que sea consensuado, ambas personas deben estar de acuerdo en tener relaciones sexuales, todas y cada una de las veces que surja esa posibilidad. En el caso de los encuentros heterosexuales, a nivel simbólico, social y subjetivo continúa presente la tendencia de que las mujeres sean las encargadas de establecer límites a los activos intentos masculinos que buscan satisfacer sus deseos sexuales. Por lo tanto, las consecuencias de resistir o conceder dicho acto recae solo sobre las mujeres: proteger o exponer el cuerpo, velar o develar el deseo, aceptar el encuentro; o bien, no tener la posibilidad de negarse. Todo ello aparece ligado a la “disposición femenina” que se juega en el ámbito de lo íntimo, con el argumento sostenido en la idea de supuestas relaciones consensuadas. En este orden de cosas, el consentimiento sexual necesita ser repensado en articulación con los intersticios del poder y de los prejuicios sociales vigentes, presentes en las interacciones vinculares heteronormadas.",

It therefore seems more suitable to use a new expression in linguistic analogy to perversion: \"reproversion.\" The case history gives an example of a clinical manifestation of \"reproverse\" symptom formation. The general survey describes the main points of view in regard to clinically oriented differentiation, i.e., intensity, ego-proximity in the personality structure, and one's own self-acceptance within \"reproverse\" symptom formation. Underlying personality disturbances are also discussed. The significance of reproversion is relevant to many different specialized medical fields.

In rodents, mainly sexual hormones and pheromones, and secondarily sexual reflexes and reinforcement processes, would be the main innate factors at the origin of a genuine heterosexual reproductive behavior, the purpose of which is, at the favorable season, to achieve copulation permitting fecundation. It would seem that during evolution, owing to the modifications of the brain of rodents into that of Man's, the hormonal and pheromonal factors have become secondary, whereas the cognitive factors and the reinforcement processes (or reward systems) have become predominant. For these reasons, in Man, the behavior that leads to reproduction may be conceived not as an innate “reproductive behavior,” but as an acquired “erotic behavior” involving behavioral sequences of stimulation of the most erogenous body zones by a partner—no matter his sex.

      "abstract": "The most extensive material regarding specific sex differences with regard to psychosexual stimulation was up to now presented by Kinsey et al. (1953). Their results, which were derived from questionnaires, show the following trends: 1. Men more often than women were stimulated through isolated stimuli (naked or clothed persons of the opposite sex, genitals of both the same and of the other sex, and pictures of sexual scenes). 2. Women were aroused by continuous stimuli (commercial moving pictures; literary material, e.g. novels, essays, poetry) practically as often as men. These stimuli must be assumed to be more romantic than sexual in nature. One main difficulty in obtaining unbiased results regarding sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulations consisted in the impossibility to exactly define or control the stimuli. So for example, the answer to the question if one was never, seldom, or often stimulated through literature would depend on what type of literature one had read. The results of Kinsey et al. therefore may reflect less the sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulation as the difference in extent and type of experience with psychosexual stimuli. It could be argued that in Western civilization women have fewer possibilities of obtaining experiences with psychosexual stimuli: Due to the traditional picture of woman as sexually passive, the supply of sexual stimuli is mainly oriented to men. A definition and control of psychosexual stimuli is possible only under experimental conditions. We are aware of twelve relevant experiments where both men and women subjects were examined. Of these twelve experiments, eight do not need to be considered in this connection because no information regarding sex was given (Brehm, 1966; Eliasberg, 1961; Koegler 1965); they were based on too few subjects (Clark, 1950; Hess, 1960); there were only two women and",

The present media culture additionally impacts unsatisfied inquisitiveness lead them to various misconceptions and sexual dysfunctions. The male sexual dysfunction includes all sort of disturbances of coital performance and sexual congress in male. Among the various phases of sexual response the most essential is the achieving of normal erection with sufficient rigidity for penetrative intercourse, the absence of which ends into failure and dissatisfaction.

Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development.

      "abstract": "Sexuality includes eroticism. Though its determinants are multivariate and developmentally sequential, most current biological theories arbitrarily exclude social determinants, and vice versa. Developmentally, masculinization is not necessarily synonymous with defeminization, nor feminization with demasculinization. In the development of brain and behavior, behavior that appears to be either male or female may actually be sex-shared but sex-different in the threshold for its expresion. Parent-child bonding is a precursor of subsequent erotosexual pair-bonding. Suppresion of erotosexual rehearsal play in childhood is a precursor of postpubertal and adult erotesexual pathology. The criterion defining the heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual conditions is the sex of the partner with whom a limerent (falling-in-love) pairbond is possible; and there is no evidence that pubertal sex steroids, per se, are responsible for which of the three it will be. The phases of an erotosexual encounter are proception, acception, and conception. The disorders of proception, manifested in both imagery and practice, are the paraphilic syndromes (formerly known as perversions). The disorders of acception may be either hypophilic deficiences, of hyperphilic increases. The disorders of conception are those of infertility. There is a nonsystematic relationship of erotosexualism to the hormonal cycle of the menses and to gerontological hormonal changes.",

      "abstract": "Empirical research, clinical experience, and greater sophistication about the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors have produced marked changes in the appreciation of the importance of sexuality in older persons. An earlier view linking sex exclusively with reproductive function has given way to a holistic view of sex as vital to self-concept, the maintenance of healthy interpersonal relationships, and a sense of integrity. Older adults often have difficulty communicating sexual problems, concerns, and questions because of their conflicting attitudes and perceptions. Sexual problems often are presented covertly, expressed in vague terms, or masked by embarrassment. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of covert sexual dysfunctions, clear about their own attitudes and expectations to avoid stereotyping the elderly, and knowledgeable about pharmacological, organic, and psychosocial bases of sexual problems in older patients.",

      "abstract": "Four studies investigated children's explanations for family resemblance and species-typical characteristics, under different conditions of biological parentage and rearing environment. Participating were 226 children between 3 and 11 years. Children Children were presented with a number of different tasks, some involving people and some domestic animals. Each task involved interviews in which children predicted what kinds, of physical and behavioral characteristics offspring would be most likely to demonstrate under normal biological parentage and rearing, adoptive rearing, inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with own species, or inter-uterine transplant parentage and rearing with transplant species. In all studies, particularly those involving non-human animals, there was a strong tendency for children of all ages to draw on essentialist explanations for their predictions. Among the youngest children (3-4 year olds), psychological intentional explanations were common. It was not until 6 to 7 years that explanations clearly began to refer to physical processes and putative biological mechanisms. The period between 4 and 6 years appeared to be a transitional phase where performance and explanations were more variable and seemed to be highly task-dependent. Biological-based, although often inaccurate, explanations for inheritance increased dramatically around 10 to 11 years. (Contains 11 references.)

Kitzinger (2005a: 228), for example, has recently suggested that moments of ‘sexual joking, banter, reports of (hetero)sexual activity, and innuendo’ are frequent and explicit occurrences of (hetero)-sexual talk comprising everyday conversation. Yet on other occasions, gender remains implicit and backgrounded throughout: ‘the utterly banal and commonplace nature of these heterosexual performances … simply getting on with the business of their lives, treating their own and others’ heterosexuality as entirely unremarkable, ordinary, taken-for-granted and displaying it incidentally in the course of some other action in which they are engaged' (Kitzinger, 2005a: 255).",

      "title": "The Prevalence of Perimenstrual Distress among Sri Lankan Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Adolescent development is a period of transitions that involves biological, psychological and social changes. According to Hill (1983), there are 3 features of adolescent development which involve biological, cognitive and social transition.Cognitive transitionCompared to children adolescents think in ways that are more advanced, more efficient and generally more complex. According to Piaget final stage of cognitive development in one's life span is believed to emerge during adolescence. It is characterised by abstract, idealistic and logical thoughts.Social transitionThe most noteworthy aspect of social transition in adolescence includes increase in the amount of time adolescents spend with their peers, intensified need for intimacy and emergence of sexual and romantic relationships. (Steinberg, 2002.)Biological transitionAs described by Tanner (1989) five important physical changes are evident during puberty in the case of girls. These are breast, pubic and auxiliary hair growth, growth in height and menstruation.Menstruation is the visible manifestation of cyclic physiological uterine bleeding. The shedding of the endometrium takes place due to invisible interplay of hormones mainly through hypothalamus, pituitary ovarian axis (Dutta, 2007). The first menstruation (menarche) occurs between the ages of 11 to 15 years with a mean of 13 years. (Padubidiri & Daftary 2004).Psychological transitionHost of psychological changes accompany adolescent's pubertal development. (Sarigiani & Petersen 2000; Susman & Rogol, 2004). Many psychological problems emerge as a result of inability to understand the anatomical morphological and psychological changes expected during adolescence.For an adolescent girl, getting her 1st period is a physical milestone. But it can be confusing and scary, particularly if she encounters certain problems like dysmenorrhoea or Pre Menstrual Syndrome (PMS).DysmenorrhoeaDysmenorrhoea means painful cramping pain accompanying menstruation. Primary dysmenorrhoea refers to one that is not associated with any identifiable pelvic pathology. The pathogenesis of pain attributed to biochemical imbalances. Secondary dysmenorrhoea refers to the one associated with the presence of organic pelvic pathology, i.e. fibroids, PID, endometriosis. Primary dysmenorrhoea is widely prevalent; more than 70% of teenagers suffer from varying degrees of discomfort. Both the local and systematic symptoms are apparently the result of increased levels of prostaglandins in the menstrual fluids. This results in uterine cramping, nausea, vomiting, backache, diarrhoea, giddiness, syncope and fainting. (Padubidiri & Daftary 2004.)Pre Menstrual SyndromeAlthough the concept of physical and menstrual distress in the premenstrual phase has been recognized in the earliest medical writing, it was not delineated as a clinical entity until 1931. Pre menstrual tension was the name given by Frank to describe the distressing psychological or physiological symptoms which some women experience regularly towards the end of each menstrual cycle and which significantly regress throughout the rest of the cycle (Talyor, Green & Stout, 2004).Review of Related StudiesFreeman et al., (1993) examined the relationship between premenstrual symptoms, dysmenorrhoea and emotional distress factors in a sample of 165 females, aged 15-19 years. Premenstrual symptoms were correlated with dysmenorrhoea (r = 0.54, p",

      "abstract": "The phrase 4*wrongful life has been coined to cover several kinds of tort claims which have some resemblance to each other, but which also have important differences. The first of these is a suit by an il legitimate child asking for damages from his parents or others to compensate him for the stigma or deprivation which the status of il legitimacy generally carries with it. These cases have been discussed elsewhere.1 Another kind of suit to which the same label is some times attached is that which arises when a man or woman engages a physician to perform an operation for sterilization or to supply con traceptive devices and a child is later born as a result of the physi cian's alleged negligence in performing the operation or in pro viding the contraception. This claim is made by the parents, not the child, and therefore involves quite different issues from those in the suit by the illegitimate child. It is sometimes also referred to as a suit for wrongful or wrongful conception. A third type of claim arises when a woman gives birth to a defective or deformed or mentally retarded child as a result of the alleged negligence of her physician either in not preventing the birth or in not informing her",

      "abstract": "In this research we define the involuntary celibate as one who desires to have sex but has been unable to find a willing partner for at least 6 months prior to being surveyed. The 6-month mark reflects the reality that people often go without sex for weeks or months but after a certain length of time begin to worry. We realize however the arbitrariness of choosing a specific length of time and suggest that what is really important is whether or not persons define themselves as involuntarily celibate. As Thomas (1966) pointed out situations we define as real become real in their consequences. Thus for our purposes length of time without sex is less important than self-defining as involuntarily celibate. Involuntary celibates may be married or partnered persons whose partners no longer desire to have sex with them unpartnered singles who have never had sex or unpartnered singles who have had sexual relationships in the past but are unable to currently find partners. Involuntary celibates include heterosexuals bisexuals homosexuals and transsexuals. We used a life course perspective to understand the process by which persons become and remain involuntarily celibate. In doing so we compared and contrasted three groups of involuntary celibates exploring the transitions and trajectories by which involuntary celibacy developed and was maintained. (excerpt)",

The only legacy we pass into subsequent generations are germ cells in the developing gonads. [1] In sex development, there are two distinguishably different processes, namely sex determination and sex differentiation. Sex determination is the developmental decision that directs the bipotential gonad into a sexually dimorphic individual. [2] Sexual differentiation is how the male and female sexual organs develop from bipotential embryonic structures. It involves sequential stages, namely genetic, gonadal, hormonal, phenotypic, and psychological. At the genetic stage, chromosomal sex is determined by the chromosomal constitution after fertilization, where XY denotes male and XX indicates female. Until the sixth week of embryonic life, no sexual difference is observable in the fetus. Undifferentiated gonads of XX or XY are similar in morphology and can form either ovaries or testes. Differentiation of bipotential gonad into either ovaries or testes occurs in the gonadal stage. Followed by gonadal differentiation, the internal genital tract and the external genitalia develop into male or female structures in the phenotypic stage. [3] [4]",

Its origin is shrouded with mysteries but historical evidences point to Egypt as the source country, before its spread through countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Middle East, as well as some migrants in Europe, United States and Australia. Reasons for carrying out the practice range from ethnic and tribal cultures, family relations, tribal connections, class, economic and social circumstances; and education etc. The effects on the affected young girls and women may be short term (severe pain, shock, haemorrhage (bleeding), tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue and sometimes death); or long term (physical, sexual and psychological). Different nations in the affected regions have enacted one law or the other at a point in time in their history to curb this degrading menace but the prevalence data shows that the practice is far from being eradicated. The discourse brings to the fore, the implications of FGM practice on the dignity of the female gender and proposes an annihilation of this dastardly act.",

      "abstract": "In the preceding chapters, processes with a greater degree of autonomy, such as growth, maturation and ageing, were examined. This chapter and the next examine sexual communication and the effects of procreational biology on the foundation of social structure. To effectively synchronize social interactions an animal needs both the ability to send information to others and the capacity to receive (and correctly interpret) signals from others. Both aspects of communication must evolve together and involve co-ordinated nervous and hormonal interactions. Reproductive behaviour has its origin in genetic coding, but its final expression is vulnerable to modifying epigenetic influences and past history. The extent to which our behaviour follows the dictates of our genes or is the expression of conscious inventions of our thinking brains is not known, but it is the subject of much controversy. Many behavioural patterns, for example, feeding, sleeping and breathing, are essential and recur throughout our lifespan. Other behavioural patterns, not essential for individual survival, are brief and may occur rarely or even only once in a lifetime but still have great significance. Such patterns may include parturition, lactation or even copulation. The first coitus is usually a milestone in the psychosocial development of an individual as it represents a critical, dynamic conjunction of two bodies. Copulation co-ordinates, through a complex series of neuroendocrine events, the transition between two major life stages, prereproduction and reproduction. The co-ordination of the behavioural aspects again represents the interaction of another complex series of neuroendocrine events. Gamete production can proceed in total social isolation, but the production of viable young (ignoring IVF technology) requires social exchanges.",

Sometimes, their actions are rewarded or reinforced immediately, but often this is not the case; to be successful, animals must learn to act on the basis of delayed reinforcement. They may also profit by choosing delayed reinforcers over immediate reinforcers, if the delayed reinforcers are sufficiently large. However, individuals differ in their ability to choose delayed rewards. Selfcontrolled individuals are strongly influenced by delayed reinforcement, and choose large, delayed rewards in preference to small, immediate rewards; in contrast, individuals who are relatively insensitive to delayed reinforcement choose impulsively, preferring the immediate, smaller reward in this situation (1). Impulsivity has long been recognized as a normal human characteristic (2) and in some circumstances it may be beneficial (3), but impulsive choice contributes to deleterious states such as drug addiction (4-8) and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (9).",

The present study was carried out to evaluate the existence of a nycthemeral rhythm of human sexual behavior and to identify environmental factors responsible for the rhythmic pattern.Methods: Non-traditional university students (ages 18 to 51 years) recorded the times of day when they went to sleep, when they woke up, and when they had sex for 3 consecutive weeks. They also answered a questionnaire designed to identify the causes of their selection of time for sex.Results: The majority of sexual encounters took place at bedtime (11 pm to 1 am). The most common explanations for this temporal pattern were the rigidity of the professional work schedule and family obligations and the availability of the partner, which reduced the opportunity for sexual encounters at other times of the day.Conclusion: Most sexual encounters take place around bedtime. Although the presence of an endogenous component responsible for this temporal pattern cannot be excluded, the evidence indicates strong environmental forcing, particularly from the work/family schedule of the individuals and from partner availability.",

The after-effects of extrovertive experience are often beneficial, but there can also be difficulties. Re-adjustment to ordinary life can be problematic. Communication issues are liable to arise: there can be a taboo on discussion of the experiences, and the ineffability of mystical experience, if only partial in the case of extrovertive experience, can make description difficult.",

For example, a common trope in television, film, and other media is that women who engage in casual sex have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work has focused on the lay theories individuals hold about them. Across six experiments with U.S. adults ( N = 1,469), we found that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who engage in casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly; is not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism; and is mediated by inferences that women who have casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy—yet the stereotype persists when women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, the stereotype appears to be unfounded; across experiments, the same participants’ sexual behavior was not significantly correlated with their self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "Age is the predominant risk factor for developing prostate cancer, leading to its description as an \"older man's disease.\" Changed sexual embodiment is a concern for men who develop prostate cancer, often compounding experiences of age-related sexual decline. Although research has examined heterosexual men's experiences of aging in the context of sexual embodiment after prostate cancer, gay and bisexual men have received little attention. This qualitative study used a material-discursive analysis, drawing on positioning theory and intersectionality, to explore constructions of aging following prostate cancer in 46 gay or bisexual men. Thematic decomposition of one-to-one interviews identified three subject positions: \"mastering youth,\" involving maintaining an active sex life through biomedical interventions, accessing commercial sex venues, or having sex with younger men; \"the lonely old recluse,\" involving self-positioning as prematurely aged and withdrawal from a gay sexual scene; and \"accepting embodied aging,\" involving the incorporation of changed sexual function into intimate relationships and finding pleasure through nonsexual activities. These subject positions are conceptualized as the product of intersecting masculine and gay identities, interpreted in relation to broader cultural discourses of \"new aging\" and \"sexual health,\" in which sexual activity is conceptualized as a lifelong goal.",

      "abstract": "Sex dolls are passively jointed human-like structures. Their limited but non negligible dissemination may suggest future new modes of sexual and affective relationships with sex robots. Understanding the quality of the relationship between a owner and his/her sex doll could help us to anticipate the social consequences of future sex robots. In this framework, we propose, from available testimonies reporting a large range of behaviors including sexual relationships, destructive behaviors, or installation of the doll in the daily life of the owner, or romance with the doll generally expressed by photographies, to interpret the sex doll as a new form of transitional object in the words of Winnicott. Moreover, the hyper-sexualized appearance of the doll makes easier its fetishization as a \"labor of signification\" according to Baudrillard's semiotic theory. If to cherish a transitional object in adulthood can be an indicator of depressive syndromes or borderline personality disorder, no emotional disorder is necessary linked to its private use. Further studies about sex dolls and robots could so take advantage of work that was already done with other forms of transitional objects for adults.",

      "title": "The Mystery of Mammalian Puberty: How Much More Do We Know?",
      "abstract": "THE MYSTERY OF MAMMALIAN PUBERTY: HOW MUCH MORE DO WE KNOW? SERGIO R. OJEDA* Introduction The advent of sexual maturation is one of the most remarkable events in the life span of an individual. In both humans and lower species the attainment of puberty signals sexual availability, but in even the most primitive cultures puberty also represents the end of absolute parental dependence and the initiation of greater (and not necessarily welcomed) social responsibilities. The ancients were fascinated, as we are, by the somatic changes associated with sexual development but were not particularly attentive to the psychological manifestations of the process. Nowadays this is recognized as important, but in contrast to the somatic changes, little if anything is known about the influence that hormones may have in shaping and/or initiating pubertal psychological and behavioral shifts. Strong morphological , biochemical, and molecular evidence now exists, indicating that steroid hormones of gonadal and adrenal origin are recognized by specific receptor molecules in discrete brain areas, thereby affecting neuronal function in various manners. Thus, it would not be unreasonable to suspect that the underlying biological component of pubertal changes in mood, cognitive behavior, and social adaptation involves the action of steroid hormones on relevant neuronal populations. While detection of psychological changes during human puberty may require considerable experience, the somatic changes are so conspicuous that they cannot pass unnoticed by even the most casual observer. There is little doubt that a major part of these changes is determined by the integrated activation of different components of the neuroendocrine system. For instance, breast development in girls requires the concerted action of many hormones, including gonadal steroids, prolactin, and *Division of Neuroscience, Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, 505 N.

The neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in the onset of mammalian puberty are exceedingly complex and not readily accessible to detailed scrutiny. It is thus not surprising that progress toward their elucidation has been slow and painstakingly acquired. This article does not intend to review the existing literature in the field; rather, it will attempt to provide a perspective of how our thinking has evolved over the years, where we are now, and what may be some new avenues of research that may lead us to solve the mystery of puberty. Necessarily succinct—and to provide a more focused perspective on the problem, the article will draw mainly from evidence gathered in rats and rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Those readers interested in more details are referred to recent in-depth review articles [1-3]. No attempt will be made to discuss the intriguing but still poorly understood area of psychoneuroendocrinology of puberty. Finally, in discussing the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty, we shall make the assumption that the anatomical and functional core of this process is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Basic interactions within the axis include production of the neuropeptide luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) by a group of specialized hypothalamic neurons, the transportation of LHRH via the portal vasculature to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates gonadotropin secretion, the stimulatory effect of gonadotropins on gonadal function, and the regulatory effects of gonadal hormones on hypothalamic -pituitary function. The Early Days An early implication that sexual maturation was controlled by the central nervous system came with the clinical observation that delayed puberty in patients with Frohlich's syndrome was associated with ventral brain damage [4]. It was not until 1932, however, that Hohlweg and Junkmann [5] advanced the concept of a neural \"sex center\" involved in controlling puberty and reproductive cyclicity. Unexpectedly, this concept did not gain acceptance until 20 years later, when Harris and Jacobsohn conclusively demonstrated the pivotal role of the hypothalamus in controlling anterior pituitary function [6]. These findings initiated an era in which experimental situations were imposed to manipulate the neuroendocrine axis and attempts were made to measure hormonal changes. Surprisingly, many basic conclusions and core assumptions that have governed our understanding of...",

      "abstract": "This thinkpiece arises from personal reflection on researching ‘sexualisation’, on the individuals and issues encountered and on elements that were unspoken or more rarely voiced. It suggests that the discourse on sexualisation tends to construct an ‘other’ from which speakers distance themselves, variously defined as ‘bad’ mothers, sexualized girls, ‘unhealthy’ sexuality, undesirable or wrong values, an exploitative industry, and so on. The grip that ‘sexualisation’ has on the public imagination may be due less to the social problems it identifies, and more to how it serves as a repository of disavowed or unacknowledged parts of our (social) selves. Ethically and politically, the paper suggests, we should pay more attention to the relations between self and ‘other’ constituted in and through the debate about sexualisation.",

Some theoretical approaches, such as psychoanalysis and evolutionary psychology, have positioned sexuality at the center of psychological phenomena. Much research has also linked sex to health and disease. On the one hand, certain sexual thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and identities have been described as pathological. Over time, some of these have been accepted as normal (especially homosexuality), while new forms of pathology have also been proposed (e.g., “porn addiction”). On the other hand, some aspects of sexuality are being researched due to their relevance to public health (e.g., sex education) or to counseling (e.g., assisted reproduction). Sex research has always been controversial, paradoxically receiving both positive attention and disdain. These contradictory social forces have arguably affected both the content and the scientific quality of sex research.",

      "abstract": "During the third age, rehabilitative intervention has some particular characteristics, connected to, without any doubt, functional and biological characteristics, which are typical of this period of human life, and on the other side, connected to the common way to consider elderly people, by the elderly people themselves, by the caregivers and by the social community.\r\n\r\nToo often pain, functional limitation, reduction of autonomy and of capacity to participate in life are considered normal, almost necessary, and accepted with resignation and without any opposition.\r\n\r\nThis common idea of the elderly person is in contrast with scientific literature data, which show only the request of a longer time in more young people to reach the goals and for their reintegration, without having serious cognitive deficits or important pathologies.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, fighting to change this negative common point of view about elderly age is a challenge belonging to “rehabilitation”. Consequently it’s important to improve the capacity of the elderly person (for example in a global vision like the bio-physical-social one proposed by ICF.\r\n\r\nIn a femur fracture, a hip replacement or a osseous synthesis surgery are less meaningful if they can’t bring the patient to walk, to stand up, to sit down, to climb the stairs and take care of himself, like he did before his trauma. If the interdisciplinary work of the rehabilitation team is well done and appropriate (from the beginning soon after the trauma and the surgery), if it is constant and sufficiently protracted, it must and can warrant this result. Besides it must involve not only the elderly patient who does rehabilitation but also his family and the institutional environment that surrounds him.\r\n\r\n“Rehabilitation” has another challenge: to improve physical and functional conditions of elderly people to limit the use of drugs and surgery interventions. We are talking about interventions on osteoarthritis patients, but especially regarding intervention for the reduction of changeable risk factors of falls, which are the most frequent cause of fracture and its negative complications, including death.\r\n\r\nWe have a double strategy: one is to intervene on the elderly population in general with AFA; the other one is to intervene on high risk elderly people through a specific work.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of interventions are normally collocated in the strict cooperation between hospital or university structures and local health service structures.",

But the Western’s obsession with violence grows out of a larger fascination with what is now termed the construction of masculinity. To be a\nman, at least as the Western understands it, requires not only a distinctively\nmale body but certain learned, appropriately male skills as well. Manhood,\nthat is, forms as much a culturally conditioned experience as a blunt biological process. And the Western’s characteristic eruption of violence occurs\nas a testing of both these assumptions-both the body that must recover\nits masculine features (tall in the saddle, quick on the draw) and the characteristic male response celebrated by the Western (restraint, taciturnity,\nendurance). Violence is the means by which men are encouraged to showtheir manliness, both as handsome cinematic figures that rivet the viewer’s\ngaze, and as individuals capable of triumphing over adversity as only men\nare allowed to do. Unlike any other genre, then, Westerns oscillate between\nthe conditions of sex and gender-between an essentialism that requires\nthe flamboyant display of a male physique and a constructivism that grants\nmanhood to men by virtue of behavior rather than bodies.",

      "abstract": "Parents, relatives, and friends may inflict their passions on children of the same or opposite sex. This is often initiated by sleeping together. Sexual abuse contributes to and causes emotional trauma, although the child's turmoil, confusion, wish for acceptance, and anxiety may be overlooked by the parent and professional. Mutual silence aided by threats adds to the anxiety. Despite the notion that reports of parental sexual exploitation of their children are usually fantasies, there appear to be increasing data that incest and sexual abuse are frequent traumata. At present, there is increased risk of lowering the incest barrier because of increased rates of divorce and step- or surrogate parenthood, since they provide additional potential for being sexually and emotionally traumatized. Sexual abuse seems to be part of a constellation involving neglect and a pathological symbiosis. That sexual abuse is emotionally traumatic is apparent, but it needs emphasizing. Children's defensive reactions may cloud this, and it may be years before such incidents are connected to symptomatic behavior, even when the child is in intensive therapy. In the reported cases, there appears to be a pattern of reactions and defenses related to the traumata that are embedded in imprinting and identification with the aggressor. This leads to sexual abuse being a legacy passed on to the next generation of victims, as the victim becomes the molester through identification. Adolescent self-destructive behavior may stem from guilt about sexually abusing younger children. Therapists may be better able to understand and deal with some of their patients' symptoms if sexual abuse is considered as a possible factor in one or both directions.",

Aging is mostly neglected in DSM-IV as an associated feature of sexual dysfunction and its subjective aspects, which become more salient as age progresses. However, a significant improvement in the DSM-IV edition should be recognized. The diagnostic criteria for sexual dysfunction now require that the disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulties (Table 8.1). Consequently, age-related declines in a man's sexual function may not be categorized as dysfunctional unless they are problematic for the individual or his partner.",

The most frequent cause of this is premature ejaculation in the male. Only the selfishness of the male, and of physicians who are generally males, has made it possible to overlook the fact that such a state of affairs, if it becomes stabilized, must lead at least to functional disturbances. The female sex, which has subjected itself to the male viewpoint in morals as in other matters, has so completely adopted this ideal of femininity that it holds the opposite attitude to be impossible for itself, even in thought. The female sex provides a great contrast to this. All sexual excitement is methodically kept away from girls but also in fantasy.",

      "title": "Sex and Gender",
      "abstract": "In this chapter, sex will refer to the central process of meiosis and syngamy in eukaryotic organisms. Although some form of sexuality characterizes the life cycle of many eukaryotic organisms (i.e., virtually all fungi, plants, and animals), not all eukaryotes are sexual (e.g., many protists) (Margulis 1970, 1996; Bell 1982). Certain asexual protists, for example, only undergo mitosis and never alternate between haploid and diploid stages by way of meiosis and syngamy. Consequently, one of the most fundamental questions in biology is: Why do certain organisms go through meiosis and syngamy while others do not? Despite the apparent simplicity of this query, evolutionary biologists have not provided an entirely satisfactory explanation for the evolution of sex. Much of the difficulty arises because there appears to be no single answer. Moreover, sex is often confused with other associated phenomenon. For instance, one completely subordinate, but intimately related, occurrence is the evolution of gender in organisms that go through meiosis and syngamy. In his essay on the evolution of sex, Ghiselin (1988) aptly wrote, “Gender means the differentiation into males, females, and such alternatives as hermaphrodites. It also includes the differences between sperm and eggs. Such differences are important because they create the circumstances that make sex a puzzle” (p. 9). Yet he dismisses this subject in the next sentence: “Otherwise we are not much concerned about gender either.” Here we clarify the relationship between the evolution of sex and the evolution of gender. This is a critical concept to comprehend because gender differences are nearly universal in sexual organisms. We also discuss some of the major hypotheses proposed to explain why sex exists and recent empirical work that sheds light on the factors that may favor meiosis and syngamy, regardless of gender differences. In the remainder of the chapter, we present a more thorough analysis of the evolution of gender, including a discussion of what the fundamental gender difference is and why there are so many different mechanisms that produce more derived gender differences.",

      "abstract": "This review based upon empirical research findings examines the prevalence, dynamics, and short- and long-term effects of sexual exploitation of missing children. Three categories of missing children are studied: runaways, the largest group of missing children; victims of parental kidnapping; and victims of family abductions. Between 11 and 23 percent of runaways become involved in prostitution; once involved in prostitution, runaways are more vulnerable to rape and pornography. Runaways at the most risk of engaging in prostitution are those who leave home frequently and longer each time, those with a history of serious sexual abuse, those from dysfunctional families, and males who describe themselves as homosexual or bisexual. There is no evidence that victims of parental abduction are at greater risk of sexual exploitation than children in the general population. Sexual abuse sometimes accompanies nonfamily abductions, but public fears may have exaggerated this connection; when sexual abuse does occur during nonfamily abduction, the effects on these children are probably quite severe and long lasting, with the presence of many symptoms more than 4 years later.",

ISD is multicausal and multidimensional and manifests differently for males and females. Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance. This article outlines a therapeutic plan for establishing resilient sexual desire by emphasizing intimacy, pleasure, satisfaction, and realistic sexual expectations.",

The early life experience of the individual is found to be the major force in making the decision about whether and how the aggressive drives are expressed in violent forms. There are some constitutional patterns which particularly lend themselves to the more openly aggressive forms of interactive and impulsive individuals. There are environmental shaping forces which can be major influences such as being reared in a setting where violence between people is commonplace. Group pressures and influences can be later determinants. There are specific developmental stages, particularly between two and four years of age when there is active interest in and experimentation with sadistic and other violent forms of interaction and expression. It is during these stages that major decisions are made about whether the aggressive energy is expressed in socially acceptable, useful patterns and interests, or whether they will be anti‐social in nature.

      "title": "[Sexuality of pregnant women].",
      "abstract": "Over the time when the sexual intercourse has been considered merely one of a number of forms of sexual contact, views on sexuality during pregnancy have undergone considerable transformation. A great many of authors emphasise, that the pregnancy is a stimulus for partners to search for ways to maintain mutual emotional bond, close physical affinity and satisfy sexual needs not necessarily finished with an intercourse. The fact, that one of the two partners is pregnant, imposes some restrictions on sexual life. Not rarely, in particular in the first trimester of pregnancy, a female is little interested in sex. It is due to, inter alia, hormonal changes resulting in nausea, fatigue and increased nervosity. These symptoms contribute to general feebleness and reduction of the level of sexual needs and difficulty to become aroused and sexually ready. In spite of that, a lot of women have the need to keep physical and emotional contact with their partners. For a number of couples, pregnancy becomes a stimulus to search for new ways of pleasing each other in love play, that does not necessarily leads with an intercourse. Most studies concerning sexuality during pregnancy focus on observing sexual activity, physiological changes, mutual relationship of partners, analysis of sexual intercourses and investigation of so-called sexual satisfaction. Examination of sexual satisfaction ruchedes the frequency of sexual contacts, intercourses, foreplay, concurrence of orgasms in the two partners, partners' happiness, sexual satisfaction and mutual heartiness. In some researchers' opinion, sexual satisfaction correlates with the feeling of happiness resulting form being pregnant, pregnant woman's feeling still attractive and experience of orgasm. However, some researchers observe reduced sexual activity during pregnancy, except for the second trimester, when sexual activity is similar to the one outside pregnancy. Pregnant women prefer the following types of sexual activity: non-genital fondling, stimulation of the clitoris, vagina and breasts, oral and anal stimulation and masturbation. Females and their partners are underinformed on sexual life in pregnancy. The research indicates that 68% young mothers were not informed during pregnancy by a gynaecologist or midwife about sexual problems in pregnancy and, in particular, about possibility to derive sexual satisfaction. The research makes it evident, that experiencing sexual satisfaction by pregnant women improves their self-esteem, facilitates mutual relationship between partners and tightens the marital bond.",

Although some anxiety is material and precautionary, I address the issue somewhat differently through investigating the psychic factors at play in the western imaginary. Discomfort with manifestations of erotic desire is most clearly invoked by differential embodiment where the challenge to the normative body not only results in disqualification from discourses of sexuality but also raises the contested question of who is to count as a sexual subject. My purpose is not to inquire empirically into the ways that people with disabilities are denied sexual subjectivity but to ask what is at stake in the cultural imaginary that requires such a closing down of possibilities. I develop a psychoanalytic approach to sexually marked anomalous embodiment and ask what part the link between desire and lack plays in thwarting a positive model of disability and sexuality.",

The Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale (SDMS) meets this requirement but is, as a result, somewhat lengthy (36 items). This article introduces a short form of the SDMS containing only half the number of items but generally retaining the psychometric qualities of the original measure. The 18-item Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale—Short Form (SDMS-SF) consists of six SDMS stem items (e.g., I have been disrespected, People made cruel or demeaning jokes about me) each of which is rated according to how often it had happened “because of my sex,” “because of my race,” and “because of my sexual orientation or gender identity.” In the SDMS online sample ( N = 528), SDMS-SF Sexism, Racism, and Cisheterosexism subscales were validated by confirmatory factor analysis and were internally consistent (α = .91–.95) and highly correlated with the original SDMS subscales ( r = .94 in all cases). All SDMS-SF subscales correlated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (mean r = .29), corresponding to a medium effect size. In all but one instance, related SDMS and SDMS-SF subscales did not differ significantly in the strength of their association with symptomatology. Together, these results suggest that the SDMS-SF is a reliable and valid measure of social discrimination, generally equivalent to the SDMS despite containing only half as many items.",

Primary sterilities may be psychological in origin, especially by absence of maturation of the child planning project (case of sterilities cured after adoption). They are seen more infrequently: in adult anorexia nervosa, psychological sexual differentiation disorders, masculine women. These difficulties are not easy to approach as much as psychological and organic factors may be entangled. In addition, one question is raised: who should take care of it? The psychiatrist or the gynecologist? Overall, the latter is preferable under the condition that he/she is properly trained. Anyway, it is ultimately the woman's choice.",

      "title": "Social trauma: The pathogenic effects of untoward social conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychoanalysis has traditionally overlooked the fact that unsuitable and damaging life conditions, originating in the social milieu, play a part in the pathogenesis of emotional suffering and mental disorders. Nonetheless, the self establishes an object relation with the social system, as well as with the non-human environment. This is expected to act as a container–contained relationship. Whenever the community and its institutions fail to act as a container for individuals and groups, this generates a trauma, which can be compared with the baby's experience of a failure in mothering. Such failures can be classified in several categories. The first is when the social system fails to contain, nurture, care for, and protect individuals, as in the case of the lack of assistance and compassion towards the victims of poverty, disease, natural catastrophe, social turmoil, economic crisis, violence, or war. The second category occurs when there is a blatant attack, on the part of the authorities or privileged social groups, on minorities, or even on the bulk of the population, as in the case of social repression, war—both internal and external—racism, genocide, or persecution. The third is when there is a perversion of the social system, which feigns to uphold current social values and laws while actually breaking them, as in the case of corruption, chicanery, and mendacity on the part of the authorities. One recent example of this is the impeachment process against the Chief of Government of Mexico City. The author approaches this problem by exploring the consequences of such experiences for the development and functioning of personality structure and personal relations, as well as their repercussions for individuals living together in the community and for the necessary relation between them and the authorities.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction Among Cancer Survivors",
      "abstract": "“Sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing are essential if people are to have responsible, safe and satisfying sexual lives. Sexual health requires a positive approach to human sexuality and an understanding of the complex factors that shape human sexual behaviour. These factors affect whether the expression of sexuality leads to sexual health and wellbeing or to sexual behaviour that put people at risk or make them vulnerable to sexual and reproductive illhealth. Health program managers, policy – makers and care providers need to understand and promote the potentially positive role sexuality can play in peoples’ lives and to build health services that can promote sexually health societies.” – (WHO 2006) There is increasing number of cancer survivors worldwide. A lot of them experience sexual dysfunction for a long time which can last beyond ten years post treatment. Sexual dysfunction can occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual functioning and/or satisfaction have been found to be of concern to many cancer survivors. Sexual function can be affected by physical or emotional trauma especially if the genitals are affected and can adversely affect the quality of life of the patients. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in males and disruption in the sexual response cycle (sexual desire, excitement, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and dyspareunia in women. There are differences in the pattern of sexual dysfunction between males and females as females may be able to cope better than males emotionally. Bonini-Colmano et al. (2007) noted that malignant diseases have a strong influence in quality of life, sexuality being one of the most affected variables. In their study to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in a cohort of patients with cancer and its relationship with the following: pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mechanisms of adaptation to stress, anxiety and depression, questionnaires were used which included treatment, adverse events, Zimong and Snaith depression and anxiety scale, sexual dysfunction questionnaire, coping strategies of Tobin David, Hopwood body image scale and the analogical visual test for pain evaluation. Sixty four patients were evaluated. Seventy two percent were women and median age was 50 years. Libido was absent in 50%; this was associated with gender (better in men; p=0,05) and the presence of pain (p=0,05) and fatigue (p=0,05) but not with age. All patients who had intact libido also had arousal and orgasms; this was more prevalent in men than in women and in subjects younger than 60 years. Arousal was absent in 47% of cases. Forty four percent of men had erectile dysfunction; this was present in all patients older than 60 years. Frequency of",

      "abstract": "Sexual violence myth has a substantial influence on the occurrence/overcoming/signifying of, and response to sexual assault. This study starts from a critical view on how victims of sexual violence experience misconception in different relationships and under different conditions. We surveyed 235 victims and conducted 14 in-depth interviews to look into how they experience sexual violence myth depending on their relationship with perpetrators, their age when the incident took place, and whether the incident was rape or not. The results show that victims are more vulnerable to sexual violence myth during investigation or court trial, by people around them and media, especially when the victims are adult women, and they knew/were close with/went on dates with/had drinks with the perpetrators on their own will. Victims of sexual aggression by stranger or rape are relatively less prone to experience rape myth in which their sufferings are questioned, denied, downplayed, and even attributed to them. Damages of sexual violence cannot be measured objectively by its types. It varies depending on the relationships and circumstances surrounding the incident. Therefore, no one but the victim can define the damage and its significance for each case. Nonetheless, rape myth instigated by family members, acquaintances, and media, often during investigation/trial procedures, assumes that feelings suffered by victims/women such as discomfort, anger, false accusation, and betrayal, can be easily edited and altered. Impacts of sexual assault are not a matter to be accepted based on biased social misconceptions. It should be about how much the society can empathize with the challenges that victims/women face.",

      "title": "Sexual Motivation",
      "abstract": "Across cultures, gender plays a significant role in sexual motivation and the pursuit of either short‐ or long‐term mating strategies. Perhaps the most basic motivation for sexual behavior is the reproductive imperative (though this is not necessarily a conscious motivation). From an evolutionary perspective, men have developed an adaptive desire for sexual variety, in order to maximize their reproductive success. Because the minimum parental investment required of men (a single insemination) is much lower than that required of women (internal gestation), men can increase their reproductive capacity significantly by mating with multiple women. This desire for sexual variety is reflected in findings that men seek short‐term mates much more than women do, men prefer to have more sexual partners than women do, and men require a shorter period of acquaintanceship before engaging in sex than women do. Under some circumstances, women require a shorter period of acquaintanceship than is typical for the gender. Women with declining fertility think more about sex, have more frequent and intense sexual fantasies, are more willing to engage in sexual intercourse, and report actually engaging in sexual intercourse more frequently than women of other age groups. Evidence also suggests that women sometimes preferentially engage in short‐term mating relationships. They may be motivated to engage in these short‐term sexual relationships for a number of reasons, including immediate acquisition of resources and an effort to determine the partner's potential suitability for a long‐term mateship. It is also not uncommon for women to find a replacement mate before terminating an existing mateship.",

      "abstract": "Speech carries a wealth of information about the speaker aside from any verbal message ranging from emotional state (sad, happy, bored, etc.) to illness (e.g., cold). Central features are a speaker’s gender and their sexual orientation. In part this is an inevitable product of differences in speakers’ anatomical dimensions, for example on average males have lower pitched voices than females due to longer, thicker vocal cords that vibrate more slowly. Arguably much more information has been learned by a speaker as they construct their gender or identify with a particular sexual orientation. Differences in speech already begin in young children, before any marked gender-related anatomical differences develop, emphasizing the importance of behavioral patterns. Gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation are encoded in speech in a range of different phonetic parameters relating to both phonation (activity of the vocal folds) and articulation (dimensions and configuration of the supraglottal cavities), as well as the use of pitch patterns and differences in voice quality (the way in which the vocal folds vibrate). Differences in the size and configuration of the supraglottal cavities give rise to differences in the size of the acoustic vowel space as well as subtle differences in the production of individual sounds, such as the sibilant [s]. Furthermore, significant and systematic gender-specific differences have been found in the average duration of utterances and individual sounds, which in turn have been found to have a complex relationship to the perception of tempo.",

Several reported having sexual kinks for penises but not sexual attractions to men. About three quarters reported unintentional changes to their sexual attractions or desires as they grew older. Additionally, over a third reported that their wives lost interest in sex, sometimes because it became painful or uncomfortable. Most preferred women for romantic partnerships, but were wary of casual hookups with women. The trait they felt made women better romantic partners—emotional compatibility—also made many uncomfortable with women as hookup partners, as they felt that women would become too attached. This was especially true for married men, most of whom did not want to threaten their marriage by having sex with another woman. Others had sex with men specifically to form nonromantic connections with men, such as to relieve loneliness or satisfy a need for touch. Several had sex with men to relieve the pressures of masculinity. Having another man penetrate them allowed some men to experience pleasure without having to be in control.",

Dorongan untuk menjadi perempuan sepenuhnya cukup besar, namun kecenderungan seseorang akan mengalami kecemasan,\r\nrasa canggung, dan tekanan ketika tidak bisa mendapatkan keinginannya. Jika tekanan dorongan semakin besar dan tidak tercapai, akan terjadi pemikiran yang irrasional serta gangguan emosi dan tingkah laku. Penelitian ini menggunakan 2 (dua) subjek laki-laki berusia 18-25 tahun yang merasa dirinya berada dalam tubuh yang salah. Adapun subjek\r\ndari penelitian ini adalah individu transgender yang masih belum memiliki keberanian untuk coming out di tengah masyarakat luas karena minimnya kemampuan mereka dalam beradaptasi terhadap seksualitasnya yang tidak selaras dengan imej ideal sebagai perempuan.

      "title": "Online Child Safety from Sexual Abuse in India",
      "abstract": "1. Introduction The World Health Organization defines child sexual abuse as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. This may include but is not limited to the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful activity, the exploitative use of a child in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices, the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials (1). A similar definition has been stated in Article 18 of The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, 2007 which is yet to enter into force (2). The risks that minors face online include sexual solicitation, exposure to problematic and illegal content as well as harassment and bullying. These risks are not confined to their local area but occur from people all around the world. Parents and teachers do not have direct experience with the risks posed by new-media technologies. Addressing the risks online therefore carries different challenges and requires broader collaboration to find innovative solutions (3). The need for a multi-layered approach to internet governance in India is highlighted by a comparative study of the various measures available internationally to make communications over the information and communication technologies safe. A concerted effort is very essential from various actors in order to prevent online child sexual abuse. Those who can help report child sexual abuse have been identified as social-service workers, healthcare practitioners, education providers, law enforcement officers, photo developers, IT professionals, ISPs, credit card companies and banks (4). Other actors are telecom service providers, network service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-market places, and cyber cafes. A multi-level sensitisation about the need to collect statistics as well as report suspected internet child abuse should be effected among these actors. In India, the government does not take a pro-active stand against child sexual abuse, in contrast to the USA where law enforcement officials lure potential sex offenders in decoy. In sting operations conducted in the USA, where paedophiles are lured over the internet to contact people below the age of consent over the Internet for sexual liaisons, many highly-educated and well-to-do Indians are turning up as potential molesters. This is particularly disturbing, as there are no statistics on this in India (5). Child-to-child solicitation and abuse through the medium of mobile telecommunications is becoming a serious problem in India. Other kinds of abuse occur through social networking sites like Orkut where pictures of girls have been posted on communities with lewd allusions and a listing of the victims' mobile numbers. With new-media technologies available at lower costs, child sex abuse images are being increasingly made and uploaded from India (6). In a recent case in Kerala State, three girls committed suicide after increasing blackmail that the film of classmates raping them which had been taken on a mobile camera would be publicly circulated. Generally, it is a fact that unwanted publicity and fear of victimisation by law enforcement machinery are reasons why the largely conventional Indian families fear reporting child sexual abuse. 2. A Comparative analysis regarding definition and criminalisation of Online Child Sexual Abuse The word 'online' means all forms of information and communication technologies like the internet, mobile phones etc. …",

Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

Formado por musculos, ligamentos, fascias e ossos que em conjunto darao todo o suporte necessario. Ele atua em sinergismo com os outros orgaos e sua deficiencia esta ligada a restricoes as atividades de vida diarias, varias disfuncoes como a incontinencia urinaria, incontinencia fecal, prolapsos de orgaos genitais e a diminuicao da qualidade de vida do individuo em questao. As disfuncoes sexuais interferem tanto na qualidade de vida das mulheres quanto no relacionamento com seus parceiros, as causas de disfuncao sexual nas mulheres sao multifatoriais ou ate mesmo sendo de causa desconhecida. Em relacao a incontinencia urinaria de esforco (IUE) e definida pela queixa de perda involuntaria de urina no esforco, no exercicio, no espirro ou na tosse. Como fatores de risco, relacionam-se o numero de gestacoes e paridade. A fisioterapia pelvica, pode ter foco preventivo e quando a patologia ja esta instalada sendo considerada tratamento de primeira linha para este fim. Trata mulheres e utiliza em sua ciencia exercicios de propriocepcao, forca, resistencia e explosao, podendo ser auxiliada atraves da utilizacao de recursos como a eletroestimulacao, biofeedback e exercicios cinesioterapeuticos, mais conhecidos como exercicios de Kegel. Os objetivo do tratamento sao levar a informacao e o conhecimento sobre o assoalho pelvico para as mulheres, assim promovendo percepcao corporal, melhora no padrao postural, consciencia sobre a importância do fortalecimento dos musculos da regiao, podendo prover o posicionamento adequado dos orgaos pelvicos, melhora na funcao sexual e prevenindo/tratando a incontinencia urinaria. O presente trabalho se caracteriza como uma revisao bibliografica de cunho cientifico, tendo como procedimento de coleta, a busca em sites de dados, como scielo, bireme, BVS, entre outros. A partir do embasamento teorico obtido atraves da pesquisa, e possivel relatar a importância da fisioterapia pelvica na reabilitacao/prevencao de mulheres que apresentam (ou nao) disfuncoes do assoalho pelvico.

As the dreamer ages, characters in the dream decrease, the dreamer is less likely to be the center of the dream action, and there are more family characters in the dream report.

Aggressive social interactions decreases as the dreamer grows older, while other aspects of the aggressive interactions such as witnessing, victim-hood, and the effect of the sex of the dreamer all change with the age of the dreamer. The style of dreaming changes with the age of the dreamer with men getting more passive in their dreams while women appear to get more active.

      "title": "The Universality of Emotional Child Abuse.",
      "abstract": "Emotional child abuse is virtually inevitable in the context of the traditional nuclear family and often has a more detrimental effect on children than other, more widely publicized forms of maltreatment. Clinical, statistical, and empirical evidence shows that normative child-rearing practices in Western culture have pathogenic properties and effects. Parental abuse in the traditional nuclear family often results in the personal suffering, limitation, and maladjustment of children. Manifestations of this abuse include: (1) behavior based on parental hostility such as verbal abuse, sadistic socialization, and lack of respect for a child's boundaries, spontaneity, and individuality; (2) destructive practices including permissiveness and inconsistency; (3) overly restrictive or harsh moral codes; and (4) defenses and addictive patterns which tend to transmit from parents to children. A number of factors are involved in the psychodynamics of emotional maltreatment: (1) parents' ambivalent feelings toward themselves and their children; (2) their projection of their negative traits Onto their children; (3) a confusion of emotional hunger with love; (4) the exclusivity of traditional couplings; and (5) the utilization of the child as a symbol of immortality. The more parents were deprived or abused during their formative years, the greater the impairment of their parental functions. The nuclear family is not inherently detrimental to human mental health, but it has evolved into a destructive institution. Only by dealing with the issues that make families dysfunctional can family life be made more supportive and constructive for children. (Contains 118 references.)

When this happened, the male acquired a motive for keeping the female, or, speaking more generally, his sexual objects, near him; while the female, who did not want to be separated from her helpless young, was obliged, in their interests, to remain with the stronger male. —Sigmund Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930",

      "abstract": "Discussions of sexual misconduct often focus primarily or exclusively on the parties directly involved in sexual behavior. As a result, the discussion generally centers on consent. While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior—regardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor’s prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

      "abstract": "There are many ways in which we can conceive of bodies as being 'sexualized'. Bodies are considered 'sexed' in the biological sense that they are either male or female. Thus bodies can be sexualized in terms of their anatomy. Secondly, these sexed bodies may in turn be seen to display certain gendered behaviour. Thus bodies can be sexualized in terms of their masculinity and femininity. Finally, bodies can be seen as sexualized because they engage in certain sexual practices, for example, heterosexual or homosexual sex. Thus bodies can be sexualized in terms of their sexuality. The usual assumption is that the terms sex, gender and sexuality are definable and universal experiences; however there are many cultural norms associated with these terms and how they are developed and adopted. Upon closer examination, it soon becomes apparent that what we understand by the concept of sexualized bodies is not unproblematic and a natural given.",

      "title": "Sexual autonomy, prostitution, and the law",
      "abstract": "Prostitution is a morally loaded word. More than just sex for money, it implies something debased, dishonourable, corrupt. But there is something puzzling about the wrong, if any, of prostitution. Intuition suggests there is something peculiar about sex that distinguishes prostitution from other bodily services. However, if we discount out-dated prejudice about promiscuity, it remains mysterious why adding money to sex should change the permissibility of the act. The current debate broadly falls into three camps: 1) Qualms about prostitution are based on mere social prejudice about sex; 2) Sex has a special value which is debased or degraded when exchanged for money; 3) Prostitution perpetuates skewed power relations that feed into wider gender inequalities. Too often these stances respectively ignore relevant points of disanalogy between sex and other bodily activities; rely on undefended essentialist views about the value of sex and how it is debased or destroyed; or focus too heavily on contingent empirical and sociological evidence, without analysing the nature of the activity itself. This thesis takes a step back, analysing the nature of sex and money to identify what sets prostitution apart from other bodily services. I suggest prostitution blurs the boundaries between a personal service and an exchange of the body as property. This raises the question to what extent individuals can willingly surrender powers over their body to others, as one might do with a piece of property. Should a liberal state allow individuals to freely transact with their bodies in this way or not? Closer examination of these puzzles serves to shed light on the tension inherent in prostitution and helps to clarify key notions in the debate, including the concept of sexual autonomy, the objectification and commodification of bodies, and the relevance of the particular risk of harm inherent in the activity.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of psychiatric histories of 56 women from the age of 45 to 60 diagnosed as monopolar depressions demonstrates the incongruence of natural-scientific and interpreting (hermeneutic) competence. In 60% of the cases no details about the gynecological anamnesis could be found; in 36% informations about the sexual selfperception by the patients were available; these informations were not placed under a specific category of anamnesis but scattered throughout the text and left a exigency of interpretation. Gynecological pains in a wider sense appeared in half of the cases. These datas are put in the frame of a specific, socially preformed idea of female aging, which indeed gives place to the here studied depressive syndrome, but not to a suitable mode of expression according to age, sexual desire resp. female individuality. The term of \"ideal motherliness\", i.e. a motherliness without the obligation to produce children, is introduced here as a possible therapeutic and social criticism. The interdependence of sexual mode of expression on one side, which is granted or not granted from a certain age on, of psychiatric symptoms becoming relevant and a fitting niche on the other is called 'ecology' with regard to the said background and according to Bateson. So the dysfunctional stabilization of the patient is regarded as a reflexive kind of way.",

      "title": "The adolescent and contraception.",
      "abstract": "Coital activity is often initiated during adolescence, and adolescents, like many adults, do not behave in purely rational ways and frequently fail to protect themselves against undesired pregnancy. Public attention is focused on adolescent pregnancies because of their increasing number and because the consequences are usually catastrophic. Unplanned pregnancies can have physical, psychosocial, and prenatal effects. It is important from both the individual and societal perspective that high priority be given to the task of preventing adolescent pregnancy. The health care provider, to gain the trust of the adolescent, must be open, honest, and willing to consider the young person's feelings and motivations. In addition to historical data and physical examination, the choice of a contraceptive method is based on individual preferences involving personal, familial, religious, and societal beliefs as well as sexual practice. A decision involving birth control for the adolescent can be complicated by parental influence and involvement. The teenage years are frequently a time of embarrassment about the physical maturation and biological functioning of the body. Birth control methods which require a person to touch himself/herself or to be used at the time of sexual intercourse may be unacceptable to the teenager. Fertility awareness techniques, such as basal body temperature, rhythm, and cervical mucus methods are inexpensive but call for a high degree of personal motivation. The use of a diaphragm requires an office visit and a pelvic examination for fitting and prescription. Contraceptive foam, suppositories, and condoms can be easily obtained over-the-counter for a minimal cost, and a moderate degree of personal motivation is needed for their effective use. Though effective, abortions should not be recommended indiscriminately. Permanent contraceptive methods are not recommended for the adolescent. The IUD and oral contraceptives (OCs) are recommended for adolescents who are unwilling to touch themselves or who desire a birth control method which can be used apart from the act of sexual intercourse. Both are highly effective, but there are important factors to consider in their prescription. Both methods require an initial office visit and pelvic examination and an additional procedure for the insertion of the IUD. Follow-up visits are essential and a prescription is necessary for the OCs. Cost can be prohibitive for the adolescent. Both have possible side effects contributing to mild to major discomfort.",

This dysfunction was first described in 1998 by Rosser's team investigating its biopsychosocial correlates in a sample of men who had sex with men. The work is theoretical in nature and is an attempt to integrate the current knowledge on the phenomenon of anodyspareunia. It presents attempts to define the phenomenon and data on its prevalence, possible reasons for its occurrence and further research directions. The analyzed studies show that although the occurrence of anodyspareunia is influenced by both physiological factors (e.g., lack of lubrication, oral or manual stimulation of the anus prior to penetration) and psychological factors, the latter seem to play a decisive role in the experience of pain. Not all people who practice anal sex report pain associated with it, which may lead to the perception of anal dyspareunia.",

Philosophical or social contingencies have an important role in determining whether the individual will adopt a behavior in agreement with this motivation. Religious or social prohibitions can, for example, prevent an individual from having an extra-marital relationship. Here cortical activity takes precedence over the impulse originating in hypothalamic or limbic areas, but the motivation remains. Innumerable literary works examine the conflict between the sex drive and social prohibitions consciously managed by the cortex. This motivation is also modulated by many other factors (e.g., lack of sexual desire in a situation of stress), but the main determinant remains hormones in humans and animals. Many arguments support this thesis.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Child sexual abuse (CSA) is the involvement of children and adolescents in sexual activities (usually for adult sexual stimulation or gratification) that they cannot fully comprehend and to which they cannot consent as a fully equal, self-determining participant, because of their early stage of development [Box 1].Box 1: Defining child sexual abuseIt is important to understand the nature and type of CSA as the severity of the impact of the abuse depends on not only on the type of abuse but also on the duration of the abuse and very importantly, whether the abuser is a known/trusted person or a stranger [Table 1].Table 1: Nature or type of child sexual abuseThus, CSA is a complex issue, wherein impact and recovery depend on all of the above variables and how they combine to influence the child's experience of abuse. Even where there are two children, who have been impacted by identical forms and processes of abuse (similar variables), they may still be different in terms of their responses. This difference is accounted for personality and temperament of each child, and social context and circumstances of each child, due to which each child perceives and internalizes the abuse differently, thus resulting in different emotional and behavioral states to the abuse, and necessitating different psychosocial and mental health responses. CSA is not a clinical condition or diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for standard child psychiatric conditions can be developed based on existing knowledge and practices. However, to develop clinical practice guidelines for an experience that is both nuanced and complicated by psychological and social processes is a particular challenge. Clinical practice guidelines for CSA, therefore, necessitate mental health professionals to work with many processes and systems to effectively assist the child. CONTEXT OF CONSULTATION There are broadly three contexts in which children present for consultation on sexual abuse issues. The first is when CSA is already established by agencies and individuals, and they refer the child to the mental health system. Such referrals may be received from: (i) District Child Protection Units; (ii) Childline and child care agencies/service providers; (ii) Police; and (iii) Courts and judicial personnel. Children are brought by such agencies and bodies either for interventions in the wake of trauma and emotional problems and/or for inquiry and evidence gathering for use in court cases. Thus, in this context, the mental health system is not required to establish whether or not CSA has occurred, as it is already known – usually, children would have reported abuse or in case of children in sex trafficking, they have been rescued through a raid on sex work institutions, and so the abuse has come to light. The second context is one in which the child has reported to his/her parents but they, in turn, have not reported the abuse to police or legal systems. However, they seek consultation to provide the child with mental health interventions. The third context is when it is not (yet) known that he/she has been sexually abused; the child comes to the mental health system for some psychological or psychiatric manifestation, but on enquiry and examination, CSA issues emerge in one of the following ways: The child discloses or reports abuse An adolescent girl is found to be pregnant (Frequent) urinary tract infections in the child are reported by the child/caregivers and/or genital injuries in the child are reported/observed Emotional and behavioral issues that are associated with anxiety, anger, and depression. There is what is called an index of suspicion in CSA, i.e., when to suspect CSA and how true one's suspicions likely to be. Figure 1 represents the index of suspicion in CSA. At the peak of the triangle, the index of suspicion is the highest, i.e., there is no doubt when a child reports or discloses that abuse has taken place, especially when a child spontaneously reports without particular inquiry by an adult.Figure 1: Index of suspicion in child sexualEqually high on the index is pregnancy (in adolescent girls) – a sure sign that sexual abuse has occurred. Genital injuries and frequent urinary tract infections must lead to suspicion that there is digital handling and sexual abuse is very likely to have taken place. Emotional and behavioral changes observed in the child are important indicators of CSA; however, they come lower on the index of suspicion because these psychological changes may occur due to some reasons (unlike pregnancy or genital injuries which do not have a range of reasons for their occurrence!). Emotional and behavioral issues relating to anxiety and depression may occur due to sexual abuse but may also be due to other difficult and traumatic experiences such as parental marital conflict, bullying, learning difficulties and academic pressures, loss, and grief (death-related) experiences… so, while emotional and behavioral changes may lead to CSA suspicion, further examination and inquiry needs to be made (by a psychosocial or mental health professional) to understand exactly what difficult event(s) or experiences they are attributable to in a given child. During the inquiry, if sexual abuse is ruled out, then the signs and symptoms may be attributable to other difficult experiences. Below are indices of CSA [Table 2].Table 2: Emotional and behavioral indices of child sexual abusePROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING AND CONFIRMING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE The procedure for establishing and/or confirming CSA has three components, namely, (i) Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment; (ii) Developmental Assessment; (iii) Abuse Inquiry or Forensic Interviewing for CSA. The third component particularly, is predicated on the first two components, which makes it necessary for the three assessments to be done in the order in which they are listed and described. Psychosocial and mental health assessment It is important to obtain a detailed history and assessment of the child, including information on family and school context, developmental level and functionality, emotional and behavioral issues (pre- and post-sexual abuse), circumstances of the alleged abuse, the child's experience and understanding of the abuse and other related problems. Treatment and interventions for abuse must be developed based on the complete assessment of the child's context and issues; this is because every child is unique and has his/her own unique ways, based on age, developmental stage, personality and temperament, family and social circumstances, and the nature of abuse, of processing the abuse experience. Information requires to be obtained through the assessment of the child and family/caregivers. The immediate aftermath of the abuse, i.e., within the first few days is not the time for asking the child to provide the abuse narrative in great detail as this is likely to distress and traumatize the child further. The objective of the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment [Box 2] is to establish that abuse has occurred and to know the nature of abuse, i.e., contact versus non-contact, penetrative versus nonpenetrative abuse with a view to making decisions regarding medical interventions, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions, as necessary.Box 2: Psychosocial and mental health assessmentIt is important to understand any emotional and behavioral issues the child had before the abuse and compare these to those that may have occurred post-abuse. This is because (i) we need to understand exactly which emotional and behavioral problems that are attributable to abuse; (ii) we need to understand how pre-abuse emotional and behavioral issues may have determined the ways in which the child has processed the abuse experience and been impacted by it. In either case, the child would need to receive treatment and assistance for all emotional and behavioral issues, both pre-existing ones as well as those that developed as a result of the abuse. Developmental assessment The developmental assessment requires to be completed before any forensic interviewing processes and/or interventions are entered into with children for eliciting abuse narratives. The purposes of conducting a developmental assessment in the context of CSA are two-fold: To make decisions about the feasibility and use of methods to elicit the abusive narrative in accordance with the developmental abilities of the child, for treatment and intervention purposes and/or as part of evidence gathering for court cases/legal processes To be able to design and/or deliver age-appropriate interventions; this includes the use of communication and methodologies that are comprehensible to a child in the course of treatment, including to provide personal safety education and awareness (which forms a part of the treatment interventions). There are five specific domains of development that children require to be assessed in: physical or locomotor, speech and language, cognitive, social and emotional development. If the abilities and skills in these domains are not age-appropriate, then there are implications for forensic interviewing and evidence gathering for court cases and legal processes [Box 3].Box 3: Applying child development assessment to CSA inquiry and interventionInquiry with the child: Forensic interviewing for child sexual abuse This includes interviewing the child to obtain information on the sequence of abuse events and how they occurred according to the child, and how the child perceived and understood the abuse. The interview may have to be carried out in well-planned sessions, over a period of time, especially in the case of younger children or children with posttraumatic disorder. Creative play methods, such as stories, art and toys/dolls may have to be used to elicit children's narratives. Such indirect methods are gentle and nonthreatening and also allow younger children with less developed verbal abilities to communicate their experiences of abuse. During these sessions, while eliciting children's abuse narratives, open-ended questions that encourage children to express themselves freely should be used. A detailed verbatim recording of the interview should be done through written documentation as well as video recordings in case of play sessions with young children so that these can also be used for legal proceedings. Introduction and rapport building Greet the child and tell him/her your name and then, ask the child his/her name Sit at the same physical level as child (if the child is on the floor, sit on the floor… if the child is sitting on a chair, sit on the chair next to her) Use toys and play activities (dolls, puzzles, picture books, and coloring books…) to engage young children and give it to the child as soon as (s)he comes to the court (while waiting for you) Enter into play with the child and spend 5–10 min engaging child in play activity… \"what are you doing? What is the doll doing? May I see what you are coloring?\" Engage in neutral conversation with the child for a few minutes (this also helps to assess the child's developmental abilities and skills as well as mental state)--What did you eat for breakfast today? How did you come here today? Who are these people who have come with you?.... \" For older children and adolescents, you may say \"I really want to know you better. Tell me about the things you like to do\" Introduce the space and the purpose of the child being there, including your role: \"My name is… my job here is to make sure that children are safe and no one hurts them. If we hear that someone is hurting or troubling children, then we do things to stop that from happening\" \"You may be wondering about this busy place and many rooms…many people come here, just like you to talk about people who have hurt or troubled them…that's why we need a big space like this and many people to help\" \"Although this place may seem a little scary and confusing, you are safe here…and after we have spent a little time talking, you can go back home with your parents or caregiver.\" Explain the need for video camera/microphone (in case you are using such equipment) – \"As you can see, we have a video-camera and microphones here. They will record our conversation so I can remember everything you tell me. Sometimes, I forget things and the recorder allows me to listen to you without having to write everything down.\" (In case you are taking notes, you may provide a similar explanation to the child). Ensuring accurate reporting This is to ensure that the child has the competency to differentiate between truth and lies and to ensure that children tell the truth. Establish the need for telling the truth, and child's capacity to differentiate between what's true or not and to say \"I don't understand\" or to tell examiner when he makes a wrong statement: Part of my job is to talk to children (teenagers) about things that have happened to them. I meet with lots of children (teenagers) so that they can tell me the truth about things that have happened to them. Hence, before we begin, I want to make sure that you understand how important it is to tell the truth For younger children, explain: (\"What is true and what is not true\"). \"If I say that my shoes are red (or green) is that true or not true?\" (Wait for an answer, then say:) \"That would not be true, because my shoes are really (black/blue/etc.). And if I say that I am sitting down now, would that be true or not true (right or not right)?\" (Wait for an answer.) It would be (true/right) because you can see I am really sitting down.' \"I see that you understand what telling the truth means. It is very important that you only tell me the truth today. You should only tell me about things that really happened to you.\" (Pause) \"If I ask a question that you don't understand, just say, \"I don't understand.\" Okay?\" (Pause) \"If I don't understand what you say, I'll ask you to explain. \"What would you say if I made a mistake and called you a 2-year-old girl (when interviewing a 5-year-old boy, etc.)?\" (Wait for an answer.) \"That's right. Now you know you should tell me if I make a mistake or say something that is not right. You may record your observations as follows: Capacity to differentiated \"truth\" established Yes No Capacity to say \"I don't understand\" established Yes No Capacity to tell interviewer that she/he \"is not right\" established Yes No. Training in episodic memory Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself (http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html). It is essential to encourage children to provide detailed responses early in the interview as this enhances their descriptive responses to open-ended prompts in other parts of the interview, particularly those related to the abuse incident. Hence, at this stage of the interview, training in episodic memory or narrative practice should be done as follows: \" It is very important that you tell me everything you remember about things that have happened to you. You can tell me both good things and bad things\" Identify a recent event the child experienced- the first day of school, birthday party, holiday) and build up on that using qualifiers like tell me, what happened next, \"Think hard about (activity or event) and tell me what happened on that day from the time you got up that morning until (some portion of the event mentioned by the child in response to the previous question). \"Tell me more about (activity mentioned by the child).\" (Wait for an answer.) Use this prompt as often as needed throughout this section] \"Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.\" Note: Focus on real-life events; avoid focusing on accounts relating to television, videos, and fantasy. Abuse enquiry Now transition to substantive issues to enable the child to provide you with the narrative by using open questions such as: \"Now that I know a little about you, I want to talk about why (you are here) today\" \"I heard you talked to \"X\" about something that happened – tell me what happened\" \"I see you have (a bruise, a broken arm, etc.,) – tell me what happened\" \"I heard you saw (the doctor, a policeman, etc.) last week – tell me how come/what you talked about\" \"Is (your mom, another person) worried about something that happened to you? Tell me what she is worried about\" \"I understand someone might have troubled you – tell me what happened\" \"I understand someone may have done something that wasn't right – tell me what happened\" \"I understand something may have happened at (location) – tell me what happened\" Young children, who either do not have the language to name private parts and genitals or are unwilling to name these parts due to fear and embarrassment, use pictures or dolls to assist the child--\"I will show you a picture (here is a doll)… can you show me/point to where this person touched or hurt you…\" Probe for disclosure Use gentle probes, including some close-ended questions to confirm some details. If child has mentioned telling someone about the incident(s), ask details, if not then probe about possible immediate disclosure by saying: \"Does anybody else know what happened?\" How did they come to know? [Box 4]Box 4: Techniques of Inquiry: Leading questionsClosing the interview The closure phase helps to provide an end to a conversation that may have been emotionally difficult for the child. \"You have told me lots of things today, and I want to thank you for helping me.\" \"I want to especially tell you how brave you are for telling me all that happened… things like this happen to many children, but they don't always want to tell others about it… because they are afraid. You may also have been scared, but you were brave to tell people about it – I am sure your parents are proud of you… I am too\" \"Is there anything else you think I should know?\" \"Is there anything you want to tell me?\" \"Are there any questions you want to ask me?\" \"If you want to talk to me again, you can call me at this phone number and come and see me again.\" (Give the child or caregiver your name and phone number). IMPACT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION After eliciting the abuse narrative, it is critical to understand the methods and processes used by the perpetrator to sexually abuse the child. CSA is a process that consists of a series of actions entailing lure, seduction, manipulation and/or coercion and threat. Different methods and processes of abuse have different psychological impacts on children and adolescents. Not all CSA results in trauma; in fact, where CSA methods use lure, seduction, and manipulation to \"manufacture\" the consent of the child (versus methods of threat, violent coercion, and aggression), there may be the less overt or visible traumatic reaction in the child [Table 3].Table 3: Understanding trauma dynamics: The impact of child sexual abuseAbuse in the context of \"manufactured consent\" When abuse has taken place through grooming processes (i.e., lure, inducement, and manipulation) and violence, threat and coercion methods have played little or no role in the abuse process, children/adolescents are less likely to be aware of and acknowledge the abuse [Box 5].Box 5: When and why children do not acknowledge abuse experiencesImplications for intervention Focus on helping children recognize various types of child (sexual) abuse, including understanding why and how certain actions constitute abuse Reassurances to child on safety and protection (from the perpetrator) Arrangements with parents/caregiver to ensure the child's safety and protection. Abuse of young children In younger children, the methods of abuse entail (i) inducement and lure and/or (ii) coercion and threat. Inducement and lure entail the use of sweets and toys to get children to perform or cooperate in sexual acts for adult stimulation. Perpetrators also use attention and affection in exchange for sexual favors, i.e., provision of attention and affection when the child complies with the adult on sexual acts and withdrawal of attention and affection when the child does not. These methods are followed by the perpetrator creating excitement and secrecy around the sexual act, often presenting it to the child as a \"special new game,\" a \"secret game\" that no one else plays and no one else knows about; and young children, who have no understanding of sexuality are vulnerable to such ruses. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury Teaching children about safety issues related to strangers as well as known persons Enabling children to learn how to protect their bodies, i.e., which body parts should not be touched by anyone except for select family members such as mothers/caregivers during personal hygiene activities Helping children discern between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" secrets Validation of emotions and provision of reassurance for children who may be traumatized by the CSA. Abuse of adolescents In older children and adolescents, the processes of abuse are similar, but the use of lure and inducement are slightly different and these processes are also known as 'grooming' [Box 6]. Given that adolescents are at a life stage wherein they are interested in issues of love, attraction and sexuality and are also keen to experiment with these experiences, perpetrators tend to use lure and inducements that are more emotional in nature (rather than the more material ones used with younger children). This means that they smooth talk adolescents about their physical appeal and qualities, making promises of long-term emotional, and romantic relationships with them—and adolescents interpret these actions as being loving and romantic.Box 6: The grooming processAgain, given the life stage adolescents are at, often also under peer pressure to experiment with sexuality, offenders have the perfect opportunity to manipulate them into sexual engagement by transmitting all sorts of misconceptions about sexual behaviors and norms. For instance, appealing to adolescents' need to \"fit in\" with their peers, perpetrators tell adolescents that it is necessary to gain sexual experience, that it would be \"uncool\" if they are ignorant about sexual acts. As a result, adolescents, who are still acquiring life skills such as (sexual) decision-making, are negatively influenced, believing in the misconceptions transmitted to them, confused by how they should respond. Following such manipulation and abuse, adolescents experience feelings of tremendous confusion, especially as they have shared \"deep\" sexual and romantic relationships with the offender. They find it exceedingly difficult to discern this as an abused process and defend the offender, often refusing to accept that this is abuse. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury In case of pregnancy, decisions around medical termination of pregnancy, depending on the medical issues as well as the adolescent's desire to have/keep the child, i.e., from a child rights' perspective, facilitating discussions with the adolescent to help her make decisions about her pregnancy Helping adolescents explore notions of love, romance, and relationships Enabling adolescents to understand various forms of coercion, ranging from material lure to persuasion and threat; focussing on an understanding of consent in sexual relationships [Box 7] Personal safety awareness and education focussing on equipping adolescents with sexual decision-making skills (a life skills approach) Validation of emotions and working with notions of self-identity, including feelings of guilt and shame, in children and adolescents who may be traumatized by the CSA. Box 7: The issue of consentINTERVENTIONS As also shown in Figure 2, CSA interventions can be broadly categorized into three types of responses:Figure 2: Child sexual abuse interventions Medical assistance Psychosocial interventions First level responses for children Depth therapeutic interventions for children Interventions for parents and caregivers. Legal assistance. Medical assistance In case a child is referred immediately after abuse, i.e., within a few hours or days), it is necessary to first proceed with a medical evaluation and requisite medical interventions as a priority. Treatment history and response to treatment (in case the child has already undergone or is undergoing treatment) should be recorded. Ideally, it must be ensured that the child is provided with emergency medical services within 24 h of filing the first information report (FIR) in case a police report has been filed or even otherwise. Physical examination Physical examination of the child to be conducted including 2 ID marks The child's family or caregiver should be present in the room during the examination Permission of the child and consent of the parent to be taken before the examination What physical symptoms does the child have at present/(e.g., burning sensation during micturition, White Discharge per Vagina, itching in the perineal area, bleeding, any injury, pain in any area, etc.) Post-exposure prophylaxis If a child is within the 36 h window period (especially in case of penetrative abuse): Has the child received Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (within 36 h) in case of penetrative abuse? If not, refer to Paediatric ART Centre for PEP Even if the child is not in the window period and the penetrative abuse has occurred within a month, refer to the Paediatric ART Centre so that a decision can be taken regarding initiation of PEP Ensure that the child/adolescent has received oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy Ensure that the child has been medically evaluated by a Registered Medical Practitioner, namely a pediatrician or gynecologist from a government hospital, for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infection and/or injuries. The STD investigation must be repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Forensic examination Check whether an additional specific forensic evaluation has been done (examination requested by police documenting abuse, if swabs have been taken in case of penetrative abuse), and if so, whether the report is available. Obtain the report from the relevant source. Pregnancy tests Ensure that a urine pregnancy test has been done In case the results are a false negative, it would be best to obtain an additional gynecological opinion In case the child/adolescent is under 20 weeks pregnant, discussions about abortion may need to be done with the child/adolescent and her caregivers. It is also advisable to liaise with an obstetrician at this time. Psychosocial and mental health interventions for children and families Following medical assistance, or simultaneously, psychosocial and mental health interventions should be initiated for the child and family, based on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment completed. Developmental assessments and forensic interviewing may follow subsequently, and be embedded in the counseling and therapy processes. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy is not specifically indicated for CSA unless it results in severe anxiety and depressive states. Children who have undergone CSA and present with severe PTSD will require medication in addition to other psychosocial interventions: These medications include specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or benzodiazepines, in dosages recommended as per body weight. SSRIs are also indicated in situations where CSA results in severe depression associated with self-harm behaviors, dissociation, and agitation. States of agitation may call for SOS medication with low dosage benzodiazepines There are a group of children with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those in whom the trauma is so destabilizing that it results in mood dysregulation. This group of children may require mood stabilizers. Older children and adolescents, particularly, must not be coerced to take medication in case they are unwilling i.e. they require to be counselled, including on issues of need and adherence [Box 8].Box 8: Preparing the children and adolescents for medical tests and treatmentFirst level psychosocial responses for children Asking questions, and attempting to establish depth interventions when the child is facing a crisis, i.e., in the immediate aftermath of abuse, is not a useful beginning. This is not the time to for detailed enquiry. If there are serious and disruptive manifestations such as self-harm behaviors, incapacitating anxiety, PTSD symptoms with severe panic, appropriate psychiatric referral at this stage is important (as psychiatric medication may be required for anxiety symptoms to reduce before any counseling work is initiated). However, certain initial responses or what are know as first level responses [Box 9] of a supportive nature require to be provided to the child.Box 9: Objectives of first level responses to child sexual abuseEnsuring child's safety Depending on where the abuse occurred and who the perpetrator is, it is essential to immediately take measures to protect the child from further abuse. This is especially applicable when the perpetrator is a family member or a person known to the child, and where the abuse has occurred at home or in places the child frequents on a daily or regular basis (such as school/tutorials, etc).

      "abstract": "The influence of sociocultural factors on physical working capacity is often ignored or treated as a residual category of little interest. Most catalogues of the factors influencing physical working capacity consider the sociocultural environment as “noise” to control for when analysing what are taken to be “basic” physiological parameters of interest. It is common, therefore, for exercise physiologists to focus on those factors that can directly generate variation in the cardiorespiratory components of physical working capacity, for example on activity or nutritional status, while ignoring sociocultural parameters. Such factors, however, are rarely distributed uniformly and homogeneously in populations, and this distributional variation is determined to a large extent by sociocultural forces. Consequently, an ecological or population perspective on physical work capacity requires consideration of sociocultural factors.",

      "title": "Erectile dysfunction: a couple problem",
      "abstract": "Background It used to be called ‘impotence’: a double-edged label, with its implication not only that the man is unable to persuade blood into his penis, but also that he’s powerless in sexual situations, in the relationship arena, and in life. The word was never just a medical description; it always held undertones of accusation – a word to be hurled across the room during late-night arguments. How preferable that we now use the term ‘erectile dysfunction’ (ED): descriptive, non-judgmental, and with no misunderstandings. Problem is, there’s still a misunderstanding here, and a serious one at that. We still think that ED is only about the man, his penis and his problem. Wrong. Yes of course the man suffers – and deeply. It’s not just the day-to-day lack of sexual performance, not just the panic that normal service will never be resumed. It’s also the low self-esteem, the failing confidence when he compares himself with other men. It’s the guilt at what he sees as failure towards his partner. And it’s the intimation if not of mortality, certainly of frailty and old age. ED can all too easily turn into a symbol of male helplessness and hopelessness, which is why the original ‘im-potent’ term struck disturbingly to the very heart of the problem. So yes, the man suffers. But what not only my postbag but recent studies 1 suggest is that the man’s partner suffers too. And that means that his ED can also become her (or conceivably, his) sexual and emotional dysfunction, and then become a relationship dysfunction rippling out through the whole of the couple’s lives.",

      "title": "Stress Mediates the Health Effects of Many Social Determinants",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines current scientific knowledge of how stress influences health and health disparities. Stress (the experience of feeling “stressed” or “stressed out”) is distinguished from a stressor (an event or condition that causes stress) and from the stress response (the body’s physiologic response to stress). Advances in neuroscience indicate that stress is likely to be an important link between many social factors and many health outcomes. Chronic exposure to multiple everyday hardships (especially conditions over which one has little control) is likely to be more damaging to health than dramatic acute stressors. “Bad” (“toxic”) stress is stress that overwhelms one’s ability to cope, causing adverse cognitive, behavioral, and/or physiological effects. The links between social disadvantage (e.g., poverty and discrimination) and stress are explored in this chapter. For example, having chronically inadequate economic resources to cope with basic everyday needs—such as food, shelter, child care, elder care, or medical care—is likely to be stressful, as is experiencing ongoing discrimination (unfair treatment based on attributes such as race/ethnic group, skin color, religion, gender, disability, or LGBTQ status). Social support appears to protect to some extent against the health-damaging effects of stress. Strategies to reduce stress, particularly that due to social disadvantage, are discussed.",

      "title": "Biologiczny charakter identyfikacji, roli i psychoorientacji płciowej",
      "abstract": "Summary Psychic sex consists of gender identity (self-estimation), gender role (objective estimation of the behavior) and psycho-sexual orientation (hetero-, bi- or homosexual). It was believed that gender identification depends on the socio-environmental influences such as rearing, learning and individual choice. It has become recently evident that endogenous hormones more than socio-environmental factors may create sexually dimorphic gender identification and role. Experiments revealed that transient action of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol) during perinatal life is crucial for the development of male sexual behavior in adulthood. In human male testosterone, produced perinatally in adult-type amounts, may play a role in the masculinisation of the brain i.e. creation of physiological and behavioral differences versus the female brain. In patients with disturbances of sexual differentiation of external genitalia (intersexuality) gender identity is also affected. Female gender identity is associated with the presence of ovaries or the lack of gonads (agenesis/dysgenesis), i.e. lack of sex steroids in fetal life. Male gender identity appears in the presence of testicular tissue (presence of testosterone in fetal life) irrespective of karyotype and phenotype of the body. In genetic men with the absence of male genitalia due to aberrant function of the androgen receptor (46,XY women), gender identity depends on the severity of the disorder: female - in the complete form and female, male or ambivalent - in the partial. These indicate that androgens are involved in the creation of male gender identity, whereas a female identity develops in the absence of androgen action during sexual differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic conflict among feelings of entitlement, defectiveness, and deprivation is discussed from the perspective of superego defense against dangerously aggressive (and sexual) wishes. These negative feelings and negative self-images are exploited so as to appease the superego in the face of one's hostile aggression: that one is justified, that there are extenuating circumstances for one's hatred and destructiveness. The \"oral\" clamor of deprivation and entitlement, together with dependency, submissiveness, and defensive uncertainty, serve a screening function for hostile aggressive wishes, from any developmental level. Typically, attitudes of entitlement are contradictory, unclear, and wavering, because of conflict between differing ego ideal images, and conflict between superego, and ego and id, about the sadistic extractiveness in these attitudes. Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.",

For centuries to millennia, sexual violence has been used as a means to subjugate, control, or demean women and other vulnerable populations. Sexual violence can have substantial physical and mental health effects on survivors. Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders. Young children who have survived sexual violence commonly display abnormal behaviors such as eating disturbances, developmental regression, language delays, or attachment disorders.

      "title": "A Third Way: Social Disability and Person-Centered Assessment",
      "abstract": "A Third Way: Social Disability and Person-Centered Assessment Christopher Heginbotham (bio) Keywords impaired functioning, psychopathic, personality disorder, neurological damage, psychotherapy John Sadler’s Fascinating Paper identifies a significant problem with existing diagnostic classifications. But in doing so he raises further unresolved philosophical, nosological, and practical problems. Although he is undoubtedly right in showing that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV (and International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10) do not provide an adequate categorization, he is I believe wrong to use the term “vice” to describe the cluster of wrongful acts. “Vice” conjures up images of Miami, drugbusting police, prostitution, and other activities that are characterized by one thing—by and large, these are actions undertaken knowingly, usually for financial gain. These are not the actions of people with impaired mental functioning as a result of mental disorder or neurological damage. It is of course true that human trafficking and enforced prostitution may mean women forced into prostitution against their will, but rarely are these women considered mentally disordered solely as a result of their prostitution. Yet it is capacitated, premeditated wrongdoing that is normally considered to be “vice.” By contrast, all the cases cited in the paper describe conditions that are almost certainly the result of some form of impaired functioning, either owing to early childhood experiences (Case A), familial culture and conditioning (Case B), or neurological damage (Case C). The common thread in these cases is impaired capacity—in Case A this could be described as due to psychopathic or personality disorder (I distinguish the two separately rather than describe the phenomenon as “psychopathic personality disorder”) as a result of multiple childhood traumas. Their presentation is not unexpected given the person’s history and, although the condition may have become refractory, it might be amenable to treatment with psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy, given sufficient time and a nurturing environment (Bateman and Fonagy 2006, 2008; Cordess and Cox 1996; Levy 2008). The description of Case B leaves a lot of room for doubt and uncertainties. Did Ms A really try to smother her child? She confessed to one occasion, but was this under duress? Did she feel that if she agreed she would be treated more leniently? And if she was guilty, does it suggest “vice,” a premeditated act, or is there another explanation—attention [End Page 31] seeking because of low self-esteem or a personality disorder as a result of some abuse that had not been identified? Almost certainly from the description given this would not count, for me at any rate, as vice. Her actions may be odd, bizarre, or dangerous, but did they demonstrate a mens rea? Was Ms A making adequate evaluative judgments of her situation and that of her child? We know from clinical work with very damaged women in forensic mental health services that early physical, emotional, or sexual abuse leads in turn to women harming both themselves and their children (Bland et al. 1999; Cordess and Cox 1996; see also for example, Jeffcote and Watson 2004). Or perhaps, speculatively, her condition was Munchausen’s by proxy? Case C is horrendous but does not lend itself readily to the forms of psychiatric classification available. Indeed there is no easy way to describe such actions other than those of someone who is either incapable of understanding the nature and consequence of the actions that he has undertaken, or is simply “mad” in a folk sense. Prima facie this seems to be the result of permanent and little understood neurological damage. However, this case comes closest to the evil that is implied in the term “vice”; and might be diagnosed similarly to a celebrated English murderer, that of Peter Sutcliffe, the so-called Yorkshire Ripper. Sutcliffe was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, although the jury at his trial found that he was fit to plead, and he was initially sent to prison, where he deteriorated. He is now, and has for some time, been in Broadmoor high secure hospital. The result of these comments is that I agree fully with John Sadler’s conclusions, but for rather different reasons. DSM-IV categories try and fail to offer a symptomatology for...",

      "title": "The function of nuptial feeding in insects: a review of empirical studies",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Nuptial feeding encompasses any form of nutrient transfer from the male to the female during or directly after courtship and/or copulation. In insects, nuptial gifts may take the form of food captured or collected by the male, parts, or even the whole of the male's body, or glandular products of the male such as salivary secretions, external glandular secretions, the spermatophore and substances in the ejaculate. Over the past decade, there has been considerable debate over the current function of nuptial feeding in insects. This debate has centred on the issue of whether nuptial gifts function as paternal investment (i.e. function to increase the fitness and/or number of the gift‐giving male's own offspring) or as mating effort (i.e. function to attract females, facilitate coupling, and/or to maximize ejaculate transfer), although the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. In the present article, evidence for the potential of nuptial gifts to function as either paternal investment, mating effort, or both is reviewed for each form of nuptial feeding in each insect taxon for which sufficient data are available. Empirical evidence suggests that many diverse forms of nuptial feeding in different insect taxa function, at least in part, as mating effort. For example, nuptial prey and salivary masses in the Mecoptera, regurgitated food in Drosophila (Diptera), hind‐wing feeding in Cyphoderris (Orthoptera) and the secretion of the male's cephalic gland in Neopyrochroa (Coleoptera) and Zorotypus (Zoraptera) appear to function to entice females to copulate and/or to facilitate coupling. Nuptial prey and salivary masses in the Mecoptera also appear to function to maximize ejaculate transfer (which is also a form of mating effort), as do nuptial prey in Empis (Diptera), external glandular secretions in Oecanthus and Allonemobius (Orthoptera) and the spermatophylax in gryllids and tettigoniids (Orthoptera). Large spermatophores in, for example, the Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, also appear to be maintained by selection on the male to maximize ejaculate transfer and thereby counter the effects of sperm competition. In contrast to the large amount of evidence in support of the mating effort hypothesis, there is a relative lack of good evidence to support the paternal investment hypothesis. Certain studies have demonstrated an increase in the weight and/or number of eggs laid as a result of the receipt of larger gifts, or a greater number of gifts, in tettigoniids, gryllids, acridids, mantids, bruchid beetles, drosophilids and lepidopterans. However, virtually all of these studies (with the possible exception of studies of the spermatophylax in tettigoniids) have failed to control adequately for hormonal substances in the ejaculate that are known to affect female reproductive output. Furthermore, in at least four tettigoniids (but not in the case of two species), three lepidopterans, a drosophilid and probably also bruchid beetles and bittacids, evidence suggests that the male has a low probability of fertilising the eggs that stand to benefit from his nuptial gift nutrients. Therefore, the hypothesis that paternal investment might account for the function of nuptial gifts in general is not supported.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life and its positive effects for the wellbeing are undeniable. People with dementia, despite cognition and functioning impairments, still pursue intimacy as part of their expression of basic human instincts. Objectives We aim to address the subject of sexuality among patients with dementia, emphasizing the physiological, environmental and legal barriers. Methods We conduct a non-systematic review of recent evidence on dementia and sexuality, using PubMed/Medline database. Results People with dementia face several difficulties expressing their sexuality. First, they struggle with physiological barriers to enjoyment of sexuality, such as ageism, apathy and limited free mobility. Secondly, either at home or in long-term care facilities, privacy is usually abolished. For care facilities, the Sexuality Assessment Tool supports the normalization of sexuality and self-audit policies that promote resident rights for privacy and assistance. Moreover, expression of sexuality in elderly can be misinterpreted as disinhibition, leading to unnecessary use of psychotropics to cease these behaviors. Additionally, legal barriers regarding consent arise when a partner loses the ability to consent sexual activity, questioning agreement and mutual desire. The Lichtenberg and Strzepek Decision Tree for Capacity to Participate in Intimate Relationships can be helpful to address this issue. Conclusions Sexuality in older people remains neglected in clinical intervention. Besides the urgent need to deconstruct stereotypes, families and staff must be sensitized to understand the changes in expression and perception of sexuality among people with dementia, rather than being indifferent or medicate what can be perceived as disinhibited/distorted expressions of normal needs.

      "abstract": "Discrimination is not a static phenomenon. It is changeable, and adapts to new circumstances; under attack it becomes subtle, even elusive. Its resilience rests on the self-perpetuating nature of power and on the hard-wired implicit biases carried even by those of us who cognitively abhor discrimination. In law, indirect discrimination involves an apparently neutral practice or policy which puts members of a protected group (say, women) at a disproportionate disadvantage compared with members of a cognate group (say, men), and which fails to satisfy a means-end justification test. Indirect discrimination occurs when an act impacts members of a protected group disproportionately, in comparison with its cognate groups. The line between direct and indirect discrimination is famously blurred. Conceptual untidiness, on its own, may not be worrisome enough, especially for a practical discipline like law. Once it is established that a protected group has been disproportionately affected by the concerned act, prima facie indirect discrimination has been established.",

Perceived aetiology of erectile difficulty was also investigated. Twenty-three per cent of the sample were currently experiencing sexual problems, with ejaculatory difficulty approximately three times as prevalent as erectile difficulty. Nearly one-quarter had experienced erection difficulties at some time and, of these, 68 per cent had remitted without formal treatment. Most frequently cited 'causes' of erectile difficulty were 'psychological' rather than 'physical', 'practical' or specifically 'sexual,' with relationship factors including communication between partners being perceived as particularly important. The presence of erectile and/or ejaculatory difficulty was related to sexual dissatisfaction but not to ratings of relationship happiness. Men having sexual relationships outside their permanent relationship found their partner less sexually attractive and rated themselves as less happy than those men not having affairs but the two groups did not differ in terms of presence of sexual difficulty or sexual dissatisfaction.

      "abstract": "Most men and women remain sexually active into mid-life and beyond. However, sexual functioning in peri- and postmenopausal women, and their partners, is widely variable. Somatic symptoms, psychological issues, partner's physical, psychological, and relationship status are all important to one's perceived quality of life, and may greatly affect sexuality. These wide-ranging influences complicate assessment, diagnosis, and subsequent management of sexual problems. A number of factors influence sexual functioning in menopausal women. There are age-related changes that are unrelated to menopause, which include changes in drive, body image, and general health status. Beliefs about menopause and sexuality impact sexual functioning in women. Changes in relationship status and the physical health of a partner may also influence sexuality. Physiologic changes, directly related to menopausal hormone changes, often impact sexual functioning, both directly and indirectly. Health care providers can play an important role in treating sexual problems and enhancing sexuality in aging patients. Effective evaluation will result in accurately determining the source(s) of an individual's or a couple's sexual dysfunction. Treatment may include the following: basic education about sexuality and sexual functioning, normalizing sexual activity in aging adults, medical management of symptoms or problems that are interfering with sexual desire or activity (such as HRT for vaginal atrophy or in reduction of hot flashes), referral for treatment of the partner's physical or psychological problem, and/or sex therapy to treat a sexual dysfunction or to manage a chronic physical problem that requires a change in a person's or couple's typical sexual repertoire. This paper includes a detailed case history of a couple to illustrate the concepts mentioned above.",

      "abstract": "Queer is what makes others think you're mentally ill. Or so I argue. Existing work at the nexus of queer studies and disability studies often builds on the idea that disabled sexualities are antithetical to heteronormativity. This work affirms that disabled bodyminds thrive on other kinds of touch: that we desire alternate universes of ecstatic pleasure. But too often does the coming together of queer and disability elide the promises of each term: that queer can mean more than sex and that disability isn't located strictly within the body. I step into this lacuna to ask how mental disability's excesses—forms of enminded deviance considered both too queer and too disabled—might be mobilized to expand the discursive limits of what queer and disability could become. Specifically, this chapter attends to the rhetorical potentialities of pathological desire, of those perverse erotics that are medicalized because they remain repulsive to the heteronormative imagination. These erotics, such as fetishes, sadistic tendencies, and pedophilia, are routinely castigated by LGBTQ and disability pride organizations as a way to shore up their own respectability against taboo Others. I argue, however, that the perceived threat posed by pathological desire is a residual effect of our collective failure to embrace the rhetorical possibilities enabled by queer and disability's interanimation. What would happen, I ask, if we understood pathological desire not as the detritus against which queer and disability define themselves but as the ideal to which each aspires? What if pathological desire were not queer's excess but rather its ultimate fulfillment?",

If a person is incapable of consenting because they are temporarily non-autonomous – as in the case of an intoxicated adult or a pre-autonomous child – the infringement should be delayed until the individual becomes autonomous and can make their own decision. Given the seriousness of violating anyone's right to BI, and especially that of the most vulnerable persons, the appropriate likelihood-of-consent for proceeding with a BI infringement on a child is argued to be at or near the 'medically necessary' threshold. Depending on what the proposed BI infringement is, then, children will sometimes be able to consent – or withhold their consent – to a proposed alteration of their bodies in a way that is appropriate for their developmental stage.",

      "title": "Desire – the pursuit of physical, psychological and interpersonal (and sexual) pleasure",
      "abstract": "Desire is a ubiquitous human psychological state that can influence many aspects of people's lives. Desires reflect what people crave and long for and can be based on physiological needs (e.g., hunger, thirst, rest, sex) as well as psychosocial needs (e.g., power, social connection). Desire is a profoundly emotional experience that has the power to shape our thoughts and drive our behaviour. In this chapter, we first provide a general overview of the meaning of desire, drawing upon classic perspectives. Most of the chapter, however, is focused on a commonly researched desire, namely, sexual desire. We review conceptualizations and measurement of sexual desire. Then, because sexual desire is experienced subjectively by the individual, and can vary both within and across individuals, we discuss how sexual desire can be impacted by personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, health) and the social-environmental contexts (e.g., gender norms, cultural sexual permissiveness/restrictedness) in which individuals are embedded. Because individuals often experience sexual desire within a relational context, we then synthesize the growing and emergent study of sexual desire experienced for the romantic partner. More specifically, we describe the association between sexual desire and significant relationship experiences and properties (e.g., love, satisfaction, responsiveness). Additionally, we summarize recent studies that have used novel methodologies to explore desire, including the inevitable desire discrepancies in ongoing relationships (e.g., daily diaries), as well as identify effective strategies for couples to promote sexual desire.",

      "abstract": "The sexual development of adolescent boys is closely tied to masturbation. Erotic fantasies are used to work through conflicts concerning sexuality and gender. These fantasies may be extended, enriched, and socialized through a variety of means, including interactions with peers, various cultural means, and pornography. Adolescents also commonly defend against awareness of these conflicts by denying their significance and conceptualizing them as mere stimulants or concomitants of physiologic arousal. Internet pornography provides a particularly powerful means by which some adolescents can disguise or obliterate the meaning of personal masturbation fantasies and so be spared the anxiety associated with the fantasies and their conflicted meaning.",

In Wirklichkeit prägen Stammtischweisheiten und sogenannte “Herrenwitze” noch immer die Vorstellungen über Potenz und Fruchtbarkeit. Ein Mann, der vielleicht mehrmals täglich in der Lage ist, einen Geschlechtsverkehr durchzuführen, gilt allgemein auch als besonders fruchtbar. In Herrenwitzen wird ihm auch noch eine besondere Penisgröße und ein muskulöser Habitus zugesprochen. Diese Vorstellungen sind in der Realität absurd und sachlich nicht haltbar. Da besonders sensible Männer, die anatomisch nicht diesen Vorstellungen entsprechen, manchmal darunter leiden, scheint es uns besonders wichtig, diese Phantasievorstellungen auszuräumen. Die Penisgröße erlaubt im Allgemeinen keinerlei Aussagen über die Potenz des Mannes, noch sind muskulöse Männer in der Regel sexuell aktiver als schmalbrüstige Schreibtischarbeiter. Ä hnlich verhält es sich mit dem Zusammenhang zwischen sexueller Aktivität und männlicher Fruchtbarkeit. Jener, in der Praxis eher extrem seltene Mann, der mindestens täglich einmal einen Geschlechtsverkehr ausübt, kann durchaus keinerlei zeugungsfähigen Samen produzieren.",

The various sexual problems encountered at this time are not so different from those occurring earlier in life, but in the final life-stage, they arise in a context of involution. Those not involved in relationships may still have problems relating to sexuality—changes in body image and regrets at never having reproduced are common themes. Consideration is given to the impact of a premature or surgical menopause and to whether ‘storm and stress’ in the perimenopause are necessary or functional for continuing sexual health into old age. The short- and long-term effects of oestrogen withdrawal and the option for replacement therapy are discussed, particularly in relation to the demographic trend towards an increasing proportion of post-menopausal women in the UK.",

Pensamos que esta anomia aboca a las mujeres a una situacion de desventaja economica y menoscabo social; la desvalorizacion del aporte femenino es tradicional y ya muy evidente. La paradoja se produce al desvelar que el sistema productivo capitalista, si obtiene redito de la sexualidad y fecundidad, mercantilizando lo que constituye no una zona gris, sino una realidad aun mas velada y estigmatizada por prejuicios de todo tipo (sociales, religiosos, fisiologicos y tambien, filosoficos o morales). \r\nEl no-reconocimiento (social y legal) de las nuevas manifestaciones de los derechos sexuales y reproductivos, es revisado en la obra desde una optica poliedrica, pero ensamblado indefectiblemente en el espacio socio laboral en el que se produce. Asi, la determinacion tanto de la capacidad reproductiva, como de la opcion sexual, o el tratamiento del trabajo sexual se convierten en aspectos que se monitorizan desde diferentes perspectivas culturales o juridicas, pero teniendo como escenario de referencia el sistema de produccion liberal, que en ocasiones considera o desplaza a su conveniencia-, el reconocimiento o ninguneo, de derechos fundamentales como los que se abordan. Esta servidumbre se analiza desde una perspectiva generica y tambien revisando algunos casos concretos del sistema normativo espanol, que, por otra parte, representan modelos comunes en los paises de nuestro entorno. Tambien se aborda la incompatibilidad entre la maternidad y el trabajo por cuenta ajena por las exigencias laborales actuales, o la consideracion de la fecundidad en los paises del tercer mundo como variables economicas (de mano de obra precaria). \r\nSe trata de una obra de enorme valor -puesto que evidencia que la minusvaloracion es grave y global-, que consta de aportaciones de profesoras/es de las Universidades de Castilla-La Mancha, Complutense de Madrid y Universidad de Valladolid.\r\n\r\nDedicatoria:\r\nAl Catedratico pelirrojo, prologuista de esta obra, en el ano de su jubilacion formal que no material, que como Vidaldi -siempre con enorme elegancia-, ensena, lucha por la clase obrera y la justicia social, alegra, y muestra su alma pura a los que le rodean (Concierto para cuatro violines B menor RV 580, Antonio Vivaldi)",

      "abstract": "A large component of women's sexual desire is responsive rather than spontaneous. Therefore, women's motivation and ability to find and respond to sexual stimuli to experience sexual arousal and subsequent sexual desire is crucial, but complex. In ongoing relationships, a woman's motivation appears to be largely influenced by her emotional intimacy with her partner and her wish to enhance it. Drugs (including androgen replacement therapy) aimed at increasing women's spontaneous sexual wanting (less characteristic of women in long-term relationships) or their arousability may have a role if other psychologic factors affecting arousability are addressed in tandem. A woman's sexual arousal is composite and complex, correlating well with how mentally exciting she finds the sexual stimulus and its context and poorly with objective genital blood flow changes. Drugs aimed at increasing the latter, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may have a role if there is prior careful enquiry as to whether genital engorgement is present but not attended to or is physically absent. Psychophysiologic studies to date suggest the former is common in women presenting with arousal disorder.",

A gay/activist psychiatrist/psychoanalyst who discusses homosexuality in the psychoanalytic literature was \"outraged\" that a \"heterosexual\" should lead such a discussion. There is no discussing the issue of homosexuality in psychoanalysis without being aware of ideological influences on psychoanalytic thought, political correctness, bias, and prejudice—the latter sometimes denied and acted out. Psychoanalysts made many assertions about homosexuality and bisexuality in men and women and usually disregarded the problem of selection bias. The behavioural genetic literature is quite relevant for psychoanalysis, however, and genetic influences on homosexual orientation—at least in men—seems to be important in subgroups. The term \"sexual orientation\" refers to a person's potential to respond with sexual arousal or excitement to persons of the same gender, the opposite gender, or both.",

The central argument of this paper is that sexual dysfunctions are not self-evident disorders discovered through the value-neutral methods of scientific sexology but are socially constructed as problems with reference to hegemonic masculine standards and patterns of normal sexual functioning and interaction. In this account, sexology operates as an institution of social control which in promoting conformity to such standards contributes to the perpetuation of social inequality. 1",

Any prohibition given to the child during the time of infantile sexuality can remain as an inhibition or develop into an inhibition, and can hold up adult sexuality; this does not mean that freedom given to infantile sexuality guarantees normality in the adult—far from it. There was no way of understanding from the theory of sex life, as it existed then, where all the many abnormalities of sex life come from. Even in those times, children before the age of adolescence or preadolescence were known to show sexual reactions and to have genital interests.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

      "abstract": "1Netflix show, Grace and Frankie, is significant in its representation of ageing. While it may appear ground-breaking to see people in their seventies and eighties navigating (re)invention of self and sexuality within mainstream media, upon closer inspection–in particular, Season Four–the inherent contradictions common to postfeminist texts are exposed. Initial offerings from Grace and Frankie extend to positive representations of ageing sexuality, female agency, and self-efficacy; however, these themes are rather negated as the seasons progress. Such incongruities feature notions of what might be considered as effective ageing: a dualism in which ageing femininity is both celebrated and fought; discourses of empowerment via rigorous, yet relatively ineffective, corporeal self-maintenance/somatic discipline; a sexualised 'feminism' which also features the women as variously alone, but dependent upon their ex-husbands, each other, or their children; and a postfeminist 'makeover' paradigm in which the pendulum swings between preservation and restoration, individualism and conformity. Albeit within neoliberal and postfeminist discourses, Grace and Frankie, while flawed, remains an important text in which visibly ageing bodies, ageing sexuality, and non-normative identification are elevated and explored.",

      "abstract": "Data on hypoactive sexual desire, which occurs in patients with hypogonadism, its classification, anatomical features, and the author’s clinical example of castration-induced hypogonadism are presented. It is reported that if castration is carried out before puberty, then sexual desire does not develop, and if after its completion, only a decrease in its intensity is noted. This is due to the fact that hormonal changes that occur during puberty increase the “sensitivity” of the brain, and therefore the “mental component” of sexual desire develops, which does not disappear after castration. It is noted that the dependence of libido and sexual activity of men on androgens is much less than in animals. Moreover, it is reported that this dependence is much less in people with a higher level of intellectual development. However, castration carried out after puberty and even in mature men with extensive experience in sexual life still leads to a weakening of sexual desire and a deterioration in other sexual functions. If we are talking about the assessment of libido, then during the examination it is necessary to analyze the severity of its various components and, in particular, the safety of its sexual component. It also provides data on the weakening of sexual desire caused by diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diseases of internal organs, tumors, other diseases and conditions, exposure to ionizing radiation. The author’s clinical observations are given, where the weakening of sexual desire in persons exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was preceded by its strengthening. Possible mechanisms for the development of sexual dysfunctions associated with exposure to radiation are reported. Also data on hyposexual sexual desire caused by smoking, alcohol and drugs use are provide.",

In psychoanalytic theory too, the differential personality development of boys and girls is attributed, in part, to their reactions to anatomical differences, as indicated by fantasies about the origins of bodily characteristics. Conceivably these reactions and fantasies could result in body images which are different for boys and girls. While such hypotheses are not yet supported by a body of significant empirical data, there are, in addition to clinical observations, a number of logical suppositions which might be mentioned. Much of the social learning, or at least training, during early childhood deals with the management and control of bodily functions and the acquisition of culturally-based attitudes toward the body and bodily parts, e.g., motor skills, toilet training, sex play, etc. (3, 5). Accordingly, parent-child and peer group relations often become established within a matrix of bodily processes and attitudes about them. Body size and the child's image of his size, relative to that of others, may be of particular significance in early social interactions. Theorists have attributed some of the child's feelings of dependency and helplessness to his small size relative to that of adults and objects in his environment (9). Furthermore, the roles and statuses ascribed to the child by parents, siblings, and playmates may vary with his size and their images of it. Similarly, the roles and statuses assumed by the child may vary with his size, or his image of it, relative to that of other persons and objects in his environment. In this connection it is interesting to note that one of the earliest concepts the child learns to verbalize is that of size. Hicks and Stewart (6), Thrum (12), and Terman and Merrill (ii) report that the ability to discriminate large differences in size appears to be well established by the third year. In addition, much of the child's early verbal training provides",

Besides human sexual life it also affects a number of further characteristics of human life and its infrastructure including the mother-child relationship, creation of the odour basis of the family with the possibility to identify the family members solely by their odour as well as other parameters investigated thus far. Pheromones have effect upon the selection of a suitable partner of the opposite sex (or of the same sex in homosexual partners). The formation of specifically significant responses during communication between the two sexes, first of all in sexual life and its manifestations, may also be influenced by pheromone-based perfumes or classical cosmetic perfumes, as far as they are selected and used appropriately. The situation is much easier if the partners are of the olfactory type where for both partners the mutual olfactory parameters are the most attractive for their sexual life and its parameters, which significantly contributes to the quality of their overall coexistence (Ref. 29).",

Inappropriate sexual behavior (a common cause of disruption among children who are hospitalized for psychiatric disorders) may be caused either by hypersexuality or by simply ill-regulated behavior: a definition of hypersexuality is proposed that can be applied at the bedside (namely, sexual behaviors or fantasies that have abruptly increased in frequency by comparison with a previous baseline, are of sufficient excessiveness to disrupt expected or usual social, academic, or occupational functioning, or constitute a source of distress), so that this distinction can be made promptly, and we present a differential diagnosis for hypersexuality to direct its evaluation. Virilization does not seem to be a common cause of hypersexuality in children and adolescents, but it should not be overlooked when it does exist.The differential diagnosis of hypersexuality in adults, which we present for comparison, is much larger than it is in children.",

      "title": "The interplay of sexual orientation, social discrimination, and legislation: A consensus yet awaited!",
      "abstract": "If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be underlying theme of the Indian Constitution it is that of \"inclusiveness.\"[1] Definitions/concepts At the outset, for clarity of understanding the aforementioned discussion, we would like to briefly touch upon the terms and phrases being used/discussed here. As per the American Psychological Association,[2] LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. The \"LGB\" in this term refers to sexual orientation. Sexual orientation has been defined as an often enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions of men to women or women to men (heterosexual), of women to women or men to men (homosexual), or by men or women to both sexes (bisexual). It also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions and behaviors. Some people who have same-sex attractions or relationships may identify as \"queer,\" or, for a range of personal, social, or political reasons, may choose not to self-identify with these or any labels. The \"T\" in LGBT stands for transgender or gender nonconforming and is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity or gender expression does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Some who do not identify as either male or female prefer the term \"genderqueer.\" While it is important to understand that sexual orientation and gender identity are not the same thing, they do both reflect differing forms of gender norm transgression and share an intertwined social and political history.[2] Historical Background Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (Section 377. Unnatural offences.—Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine) has been considerably debated in the last two decades. This section, which criminalized same-sex relationship, was introduced by Lord Macaulay in 1860 in British India. Historically, Common Law in England (Fleta, 1290 and Britton, 1300) was the first legislature to consider sodomy as a crime, the punishment for which was to burn alive such individual. In 1563, under Queen Elizabeth-I, the punishment changed to death by hanging, but it was not until 1861 that the death penalty was abolished. Sodomy, however, continued to be a crime in England until 1967 when the Sexual Offences Act, 1967, decriminalized the acts of sodomy between consenting adults.[1] Fifty years since then, many countries have adapted laws to decriminalize nonheterosexual sexual relationship and some have even allowed same-sex marriage. There are certain peculiarities of Section 377, IPC. First, it uses the expression \"carnal intercourse\" instead of the term \"sexual intercourse\" used in Section 375 (Rape) and Section 497 (Adultery). Second, no distinction regarding age is made in the section. Third, consent is no defense to an offence under Section 377. It has been contended that Section 377 is based on archaic religious moral and ethical standards which consider sex as merely a functional activity – for procreation purpose only. Thus, nonprocreative sex is viewed as \"carnal,\" i.e., for pleasure of senses. Criminalization of a consensual and private same-sex conduct has been a weapon for police for abuse including locking-up, extortion, intimidation, harassment, payment of hush money, and forced sex. Apart from victimization of homosexuals, the section also perpetuates negative and discriminatory attitude toward same-sex relationship. As per estimates for the year 2006, in India, about 25 lakh men practice homosexuality.[3] Section 377 has being argued to be a roadblock in identification, prevention, and treatment of those with sexually transmitted diseases, particularly the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Psychosocial Aspects Psychological investigations in people with homosexual orientation do not show any objective impairment or dysfunction in judgment, stability, or vocational abilities.[4] Mental health-related classification systems of the World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association also do not deem homosexuality as a disorder. Regrettably, homosexuality continues to be stigmatized due to which nonheterosexual individuals experience chronic stress. Minority stress theory[5] hypothesizes three processes, in addition to universal stressors, that compromise the psychological well-being of nonheterosexual individuals: (1) institutionalized discrimination and directly experienced prejudices, (2) expectation of victimization/rejection and the efforts to avert them, and (3) internalization of stigma (internalized homophobia). Multiple studies across the world have shown increased rates of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use and abuse, suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicides as well as other comorbid psychiatric disorders in homosexual men.[6] In a community-based study, nearly one-third of nonheterosexual individuals met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder and/or reported suicide attempt.[7] In addition, there are sufficient data to show that a significant number of LGBT students regularly experience bullying at school; end up homeless; are more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide; and the LGBT community has elevated rates of poverty, food insecurity, and joblessness compared to the general population.[8] Indian Scenario However, from India, there is a paucity of literature on the prevalence and the emotional problems faced by individuals with homosexual orientation, primarily due to lack of generation of systematic data.[4] In their editorial of 2012, Rao and Jacob[4] had highlighted the lack of clear understanding and stand by the Indian mental health professionals on the issue of homosexuality and LGBT. However, in 2014, the Indian Psychiatric Society acknowledged that homosexuality is neither a mental illness nor a disease.[9] More recently, the Indian Psychiatric Society in collaboration with the Bombay Psychiatric Society arranged the first conference in Mumbai on March 10, 2018, to address mental health issues faced by LGBT community, in which the President of Indian Psychiatric Society Dr. Ajit Bhide discussed the sexual identity issues of LGBT community. The aim of this conference was to \"positively impact LGBT community by being better equipped to help them.\"[10] The Legal Aspects Background It was on July 8, 2001, that the police raided the Lucknow premises of Bharosa Trust, an nongovernmental organization working for LGBT rights; beat up; and arrested Mr. Arif Jafar, the Director and his four colleagues, and seized literature on gender, sexuality, safe sex, and a large amount of condoms as evidence of a gay sex racket being run from there (which was actually a training material on how to reach out to the vulnerable men having sex with men). The lower court denied bail to Mr. Jafar on the grounds of promoting homosexuality under Section 377 and criminal conspiracy, and he had to spend 47 days in custody before granted relief by Allahabad High Court.[11] Thereafter From a legal standpoint, Section 377 IPC has been argued to impinge upon basic freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India, including the Right to Equality (Article 14), nondiscrimination (Article 15), and Right to Life (Article 21). It is understandable that no aspect of an individual is more private than sexual relations and hence criminalization of sexual preference is a violation of right to privacy under Article 21. In 2007, a group of human right experts formed the Yogyakarta Principles with the idea of equal application of human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender equality.[12] They defined sexual orientation as an individual's capacity for profound emotional, affectional, and sexual attraction to, and intimate and gender relation with, individuals of the different gender or the same gender or more than one gender. The principles recognize that human beings of all sexual orientation and gender identities are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights and that all persons are entitled to right to privacy, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. When this section was challenged on in the honorable High Court of Delhi, the Union of India filed two separate affidavits, both of which contradicted each other.[1] In an affidavit filed on behalf of the Under Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it was asserted that indeed this section prevented high-risk groups from revealing their same-sex behavior. This resulted in a large section of population with HIV/AIDS being unreachable, thereby pushing the cases of infection underground and making it difficult for public health workers to even access them. On the other hand, the Director (Judicial) in the Ministry of Home Affairs felt that Section 377 was required as it was the only tool for the prosecution of perpetrators of child sexual abuse. It further argued that the society has not yet shown readiness or willingness to accept homosexuality. After going through scientific and medical literatures, international law, and judgments of superior court, in a historic judgment, the honorable High Court of Delhi declared that Section 377 IPC does violate the right to dignity and privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the constitution.[1] It also pointed out that India is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 17 of which states \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home and correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.\" However, this decision was overturned by a two-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court of India in 2013 on the ground that it is the responsibility of the parliament to bring in a suitable law in order to enact changes in Section 377. It also observed that the section affected only a miniscule percentage of population and that, since 1860, only 200 individuals were prosecuted under it. With regard to misuse of the law, the Supreme Court observed that just because the police is misusing the law does not make the law invalid.[13] It must be noted that the challenge to the Delhi High Court verdict had not come from the Government of India but from private individuals. In fact, the government worked to pass the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, which it achieved in 2012. The Act criminalized any form of sexual assault on children up to the age of 18 years, thereby reducing the ambit of Section 377 to adults. Political will can also be noted in ministers' addresses. Speaking on the sidelines of the 17th International Conference on AIDS, the then Health Minister said that a proposal for decriminalization of Section 377 was under consideration by the Government of India.[14] In June 2008, the then Prime Minister in his remarks on the release of the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia said \"We should work to remove legislative barriers that hinder access of high-risk groups to services. The fact that many of the vulnerable social groups, be they sex workers or homosexuals or drug users, face great social prejudice has made the task of identifying AIDS victims and treating them very difficult.\"[15] A parliamentarian, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, also made two attempts to present a private member's bill with regard to decriminalization of homosexuality which was not taken up by the legislatures.[16] Last year, a nine-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice, in its judgment regarding privacy as a fundamental right, declared that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy and discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation which is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. It further stated that miniscule fraction of the country's population that constitutes the LGBT community is not a sustainable basis to deny them the right to privacy.[17] This remarkable judgment on privacy has provided the much-needed opportunity to revisit the honorable Supreme Court judgment of 2013. Current scenario On April 27, 2018, Mr. Arif Jafar, Director, Bharosa Trust, filed a writ petition in the honorable Supreme Court where he has sought scrapping of Section 377. His petition has received impetus as it has been tagged with similar pleas by prominent individuals, namely, journalist and noted LGBT activist Ashok Row Kavi; Executive Director of Lalit Group of Hotels Keshav Suri; businesswoman Ayesha Kapur; Bharatnatyam dancer and recipient of 2014 Sangeet Natak Akademi award Navtej Singh Johar; well-known journalist Sunil Mehra; noted chef, author, restaurateur, and TV personality Ritu Dalmia; and hotelier, writer, and historian Aman Nath. These combined petitions have been placed before a constitution bench, and the honorable Supreme Court has already issued notice to the Government of India, seeking its views on legalizing homosexuality.[11] A Corollary… It may be recollected that section 309 IPC, which criminalizes suicide attempt, had also been a subject of debate in jurisprudence. Health-care professionals wanted the said clause to be removed as it hindered accesses to mental health services. The law enforcement agency however felt that in the absence of such a provision it shall be difficult to stop a person from attempting suicide for political/religious reasons. The Union of India re-enacted the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, in which Section 115 states \"... any person who attempts suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said code.\"[18] In effect, Section 309 IPC remains but prioritizes mental health needs of an individual over criminalization of the behavior. It would indeed be interesting to see how the judiciary and legislature deal with the much-debated decriminalization of Section 377. To conclude, the authors would like to clarify that this editorial in no way is trying to put forward any assertions or take any stand with respect to the issues related to the sexual orientation and LGBT phenomena. On the other hand, we have attempted to provide an insight into not only the historical perspective related to this topic in India, the psychosocial issues, and related consequences, but most importantly, the complex interplay of moral, social, and legal dilemmas operating in our society that have gathered steam over the last two decades, reaching a crescendo point in the current year. The outcome of the Supreme Court judgment should serve as a guiding beacon for all mental health professionals in the times to come. \"We wait with bated breaths…\"!",

The most common type of ante mortem genital mutilations involves cultural practices such as male circumcision. Less common male mutilations such as subincisions are tribally based. Female genital mutilation is found particularly in African, Middle Eastern, or Asian populations. Self-inflicted genital injuries are most common in males and may be related to attempts at suicide, or to self-harming practices. The latter have a strong association with psychiatric illnesses. Postmortem injuries may arise from animal predation or deliberate mutilation of a corpse. The latter may be associated with ante mortem genital injuries in sadistic homicides.

      "abstract": "Introduction The perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the first postpartum year, is a transformative phase in a woman’s life. It involves profound physical, psychological, social, and emotional changes that can significantly impact sexual experiences. Objectives The purpose of this work is to address the challenges of experiencing sexuality during the perinatal period. Methods Evidence-based review, through research conducted on PubMed and selection of the most relevant studies, published in the last decade, using the keywords: “Sexuality” and “Perinatal period”. Results Hormonal fluctuations, physical discomfort, and body image changes during pregnancy can significantly affect sexual desire and satisfaction. By the third trimester, between 83 to 100% of first-time mothers report a decrease in sexual activity. Recent studies indicate that this trend continues into the first postpartum year, with over 60% reporting decreased sexual activity. Postpartum challenges, such as physical recovery, breastfeeding, and fatigue further complicate sexual intimacy. The anticipation of parenthood and shifts in relationship dynamics also play a significant role. Societal pressures and cultural norms regarding sexuality in the perinatal period can influence personal experiences and expectations, and contribute to communication barriers between partners regarding sexual needs and concerns. Conclusions The perinatal period presents unique challenges to sexual health and intimacy. A holistic perinatal care, incorporating comprehensive sexual health education and promoting open communication between partners are crucial for addressing these challenges effectively.

      "abstract": "Abstract Slavery has been one of the most ubiquitous of all human institutions, existing in many times and most places, and persisting in some variants even at the start of the twenty-first century. While there may be precise definitions of slavery, the term is often used to present an unfavorable portrayal of any number of economic and political conditions. Even the legal definitions have been questioned. In general, however, slavery refers to a condition in which individuals are owned by others, who control where they live, at what they work, with how much subsistence they are provided, and where sexual exploitation is permissible. Property rights in slaves and their labor can be bought and sold via market transactions. So onerous is the status of the slave that it is a condition generally reserved for ‘ outsiders’ (however defined), not to members of one’s own group. The legal aspects do not reveal all about the treatment and living conditions of slaves, since these have varied with economic, ethno-racial, and political conditions in different societies.",

      "abstract": "Western cultures have witnessed a tremendous cultural and social transformation of in the years since the sexual Apart from a few public debates and scandals, the process has moved along gradually and quietly. Yet its real and symbolic effects are probably much more consequential than those generated by the sexual revolution of the sixties. Sigusch refers to the broad-based recoding and reassessment of the sexual sphere during the eighties and nineties as the revolution. The neosexual revolution is dismantling the old patterns of and reassembling them anew. In the process, dimensions, intimate relationships, preferences and sexual fragments emerge, many of which had submerged, were unnamed or simply did not exist before.

Sexuality is no longer the great metaphor for pleasure and happiness, nor is it so greatly overestimated as it was during the sexual It is now widely taken for granted, much like egotism or motility. Whereas sex was once mystified in a positive sense - as ecstasy and transgression, it has now taken on a negative mystification characterized by abuse, violence and deadly infection. While the old was based primarily upon sexual instinct, orgasm and the heterosexual couple, neosexualities revolve predominantly around gender difference, thrills, self-gratification and prosthetic substitution. From the vast number of interrelated processes from which neosexualities emerge, three empirically observable phenomena have been selected for discussion here: the dissociation of the sexual sphere, the dispersion of sexual fragments and the diversification of intimate relationships. The outcome of the neosexual revolution may be described as lean sexuality and self-sex.",

      "title": "The misuse of the term ‘therapy’ in science, education and in many areas of services may border on 'anti-therapy'",
      "abstract": "Such a radical formulation of the problem requires at least the most general premise. It seems that the dominant factor is the tendency of individuals and even very large social groups to succumb to, among other things, various fashions – ‘fashionable directions of research’, ‘fashion for specific fields of study’, ‘following the fashion of the era’, etc. The appearance of such and similar slogans on social media, in marketing and in common social communication is not surprising. Semantic liberalism in a similar style in the field of science and education leads to justified criticism. In principle, the social orientation of the connections between the practice of physiotherapy and psychotherapy is common, not only with the scope of impact on individual spheres of personality – in the first case, physical (more closely related to body structure and motor skills), in the second, with the mental layer. It is probably also common to associate psychology (with numerous sub disciplines and scientific specialties) as the direct scientific background of psychotherapy. It is no longer certain that most people know that although there is no scientific discipline of physiotherapy, there are scientific disciplines that provide the knowledge and skills necessary in this profession. Therefore, it should not be an exaggeration to emphasize that without confirmation of these competences by appropriate exams, it would be impossible to formally recognize the qualifications to practice as a physiotherapist. However, in the social space, there are many more word combinations with the word ‘therapy’ that can confuse even people who understand the listed subtleties of psychotherapy. These include: art therapy, hippotherapy, judo therapy, music therapy, etc. Of the listed terms, ‘judo’ seems to be the most recognizable, but as a combat sport, and such associations should be expected to be common. Meanwhile, ‘judo therapy’ is a synonym for sekkotsu – the traditional Japanese art of bone-setting (is a type of folk medicine in which practitioners are engaged in joint manipulation – traditionally, they practiced without any formal training in accepted modern medical procedures). Since this is the tradition, it is rather about treatment, not therapy. More pronounced paradoxes are associated with the term ‘music therapy’. Among the benefits of music therapy there is pain-reducing. However, there is clear evidence that many instrumental musicians after 35 years of practice require ongoing interventions by a physiotherapist or orthopaedist. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence for innovative music prevention in the context of violin teaching. Pain diagnosis and immediate pain-reducing interventions are conducted before, during, and after the lesson. In this way, we attempt to resolve the paradox of ‘eliminating pain through music therapy at the expense of the instrumentalist’s pain’.",

      "abstract": "Desde el punto de vista médico, la ‘ambigüedad sexual’ en bebés recién nacidos ha sido catalogada como una urgencia psicosocial, que dispara un protocolo de diagnóstico e intervención —quirúrgica y hormonal— para “fijar” el sexo y “corregir” el cuerpo. Desde perspectivas sociales y críticas, se prefiere hablar de variabilidad sexual, es decir, de cuerpos sexuados que no encajan con las expectativas dualistas de lo que es considerado propio de un cuerpo de hombre o de un cuerpo de mujer, o en los que diferentes componentes del sexo —cromosómico, hormonal, gonadal o anatómico— no son coherentes. En las últimas décadas, ha surgido una fuerte controversia en torno a la intersexualidad y a la necesidad de cambiar no solo la gestión médica, sino también los modelos sociales y la representación de imaginarios dualistas. No obstante, parece existir una amplia brecha entre los contextos y lenguajes de la gestión médica y los propios de las movilizaciones políticas y de derechos humanos. Las reflexiones bioéticas, el papel de los grupos de apoyo y las posibles intervenciones psicosociales pueden abrir vías de actuación y puentes de diálogo y traducción entre estos espacios incomunicados. En ese sentido, este artículo pretende realizar un análisis de los significados, usos y prácticas de lo psicosocial en la investigación y tratamiento de las intersexualidades/DSD, para explorar hasta qué punto se está produciendo el llamado “giro psicosocial”, o si seguimos en un paradigma de gestión predominantemente biomédico.",

      "title": "Boys who became offenders",
      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Alcohol, Eroticism and Sexual Performance: A Social Interactionist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Impotence and reduction in libido among chronic alcoholic men has been seen to be primarily caused by physiological changes resulting from constant and heavy drinking. Studies of this phenomenon have focused on males, amount of intake, and the correlation of alcohol ingestion with effects on bodily functions, to the exclusion of three social factors that may be a significant part of the sex act: First, the attitudes and behavior of the sex partner of the drinking male as they affect interaction between the two; second, sexual arousal has been studied as an “encapsulated” act, rather than a part of the process of negotiation between partners which may culminate in intercourse; and third, the focus of research on impotence is restricted to the realm of sexual activity, ignoring other aspects of the relationship an alcoholic may have with his sex partner. Additionally, the sex problems of men in marriages (or with sex partners) where alcohol is not a problem is seldom compared with alcoholic men to see if they differ substantially in this area. In a study designed to explore the impact of these social factors on impotence, 76 wives of alcoholics, 28 alcoholic husbands and a control sample of 63 wives and 46 husbands in marriages where alcohol is not a problem were interviewed in depth about their sexual relationship and about other areas of their marriage which surfaced as the most troublesome for wives of alcoholics—companionship, meals, and recreation. Findings suggest that a good portion of the erotic reduction and performance problems that alcoholic men experience are much more complex than physiological decline alone. A complex amalgam of rejection by their partners, which is influenced by the dynamics of their relationship in other areas of the marriage, as well as their different perspectives on what sort of behavior is a suitable prelude to intercourse can be seen to affect sexual interest and/or performance.",

      "title": "Fetuses",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human fetuses play a prominent role in various ethics debates, primarily those concerned with activities within clinical medicine and scientific research. The principal controversies involve the sort of moral consideration that is owed to human fetuses with respect to obligations of care and permission for use. These questions are complicated by an inconsistency in terminology between ethicists and scientists. Scientists distinguish among zygotes (fertilized eggs in the earliest stages of division), blastocysts (organisms beginning cell differentiation, in the period from five days after fertilization until about three weeks), embryos (organisms in which the process of organ formation has started, in the period of three weeks to nine weeks), and fetuses (entities with recognizable features, covering all stages of development, from nine weeks until birth) (MedlinePlus). Most ethicists ignore these distinctions and deploy the term “fetus” to characterize all human life from the time an egg is fertilized until birth. Ethicists are primarily concerned with the question of whether fetuses should be regarded as persons – and thereby fully entitled to the moral consideration associated with that status – or merely as potential persons ( see Personhood, Criteria of; Potential Persons). Although this question seems to be one of ontology, many theorists appeal to moral arguments to support their ontological positions regarding prenatal human organisms.",

      "title": "From the Bio-Psycho-Social Model to the Development of a Clinical–Forensic Assessment Tool for Chronic Pain in Victims of Violence: A Research Protocol",
      "abstract": "Violence against women impacts a minimum of 35% of the global female population, encompassing sexual, physical, and psychological forms. Perpetrators of this violence include partners, family members, or strangers. Its ramifications are substantial, evident in the prevalence of chronic pain reported by between 48% and 84% of women who have experienced abuse, with an odds ratio of 2.08. Notably associated diagnoses include pelvic/vaginal pain, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome/bowel symptoms, abdominal pain, migraine/headache, and back and neck pain. These diagnoses significantly limit a woman’s ability to participate in daily activities, such as exercising or working, leading to genuine disability. Despite substantial evidence, the precise cause and etiology of these conditions remain unclear. Adhering to the bio-psycho-social model, it is conceivable that chronic pain in victims of violence cannot be attributed to a single factor alone, but rather to a combination of all three: biological, psychological, and social factors. Uncovering these factors could have significant clinical and legal implications. On one hand, it would be possible to conduct screenings to avoid developing chronic pain. and guide individuals toward the correct treatment. On the other hand, victims could seek compensation for chronic pain resulting from violence. Considering the limited knowledge about the causes of chronic pain and the absence of tools to identify risk factors or a set of tests for evaluating victims of violence, the goal of the research described in this project protocol is to pinpoint the specific contributing factors for chronic pain due to violence victimization. Additionally, it aims to devise a comprehensive protocol for assessing these factors in forensic science.",

      "abstract": "Sexual activity typically follows an implicit sexual script or a normative sequence of behaviours that are involved in a sexual interaction. It is unclear whether or how affirmative sexual consent is incorporated in individual sexual scripts and interactions. The current research explores how sexual consent may be expressed and verified as part of individuals’ sexual interactions. Undergraduate participants from an Ontario university ( N = 92; 58 males, 34 females) completed a series of open-ended questions that asked them to describe their sexual experiences with a new and long-term partner from beginning to end. Analysis of presence of consent-related behaviours in participants’ accounts were assessed on the basis of a priori themes and extensions of these themes. Thematic analyses identified the following themes: 1) Sex proceeding with escalating intensity of nonverbal sexual behaviour, 2) Passive behaviours that do not indicate unwillingness to have sex, 3) Indirect verbal communication of interest in sex, 4) Indications that sex “just happened,” 5) Descriptions of the context in which sex occurred, and 6) Direct discussions relevant to sexual consent. Results indicated that direct discussion of sexual consent was exceedingly rare and that most sexual interactions included indirect, veiled, and coded behaviours that require inference of sexual consent or non-consent. Consent-related themes varied as a function of both participant gender (male versus female) and nature of relationship (new versus long-term). The findings of this study have implications for sexual health education, sexual assault prevention interventions, and public policy development.",

      "abstract": "At least 10 per cent of the world's people have a significant, long-term, physical or mental impairment which can and usually does disable them from taking part in the usual educational, social and economic activity in their community. This is due to barriers in attitudes, in the built environment and in the way society is organized, which prevent us from participating on an equal level with others. The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people, when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, superhero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "abstract": "is neither frivilous nor a luxury that can be easily dispensed with. With this accelerating presence of women in workplace have come increasing reports of problems they encounter by virtue of them being women. Some of these problems, such as lower economic compensation, unequal education and employment opportunities, and cultural barriers to integrating work and family life, while important as social policy issues,3 are not immediately relevant to this article. Sexual discrimination and harassment on job are more relevant because their agents of cause are more easily indentifiable and their psychiatric consequences, when present, are sharper and more pronounced. While sexual discrimination and harassment are two different concepts, there is also an area of overlap. Essentially, discrimination occurs when women as a group are treated less favorably than men in terms of job opportunities, compensation, etc. 4 Perhaps this would better be called gender discrimination because there are no explicit sexual overtones. Sexual harassment occurs when sexuality enters picture. It has been defined as the exploitation of a powerful position to impose sexual demands or pressures on an unwilling but less powerful person.4 There are two types of sexual harassment. 5 The quid pro quo situation occurs when sexual favors are demanded in exchange for job opportunities and/or when refusal of such favors brings retaliation. The persistant condi­ tion of work situation occurs when sexual conversation or touching contin­ ually occurs in workplace. There may be persistent comments, propo­ sitions, attempts to discuss employee's sex life, repeated accidental bumpings, more obviously intentional touching, or even rape. 5 Surveys have indicated that 49 to 81 percent of working women experience sexual pressure on job. 6 ,7 While these surveys may be flawed because of sampling problems and because what men may perceive as innocent behav",

      "title": "SEXTING, NON-CONSENSUAL IMAGE SHARING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Sexting refers to the exchange (sending and/or receiving) of self-taken sexual photographs, usually depicting the sender nude or semi-nude, via mobile phone. Academic and media narratives tend to portray sexting as a deviant behaviour due to the perceived risks of non-consensual image distribution (where individuals’ sexual images are shared without permission): Qualitative research suggests the psychological harms of revenge pornography (one type of non-consensual image distribution) are comparable to the effects of sexual assault and are gendered in nature; considered part of a continuum of sexual violence against women. There is a lack of quantitative research regarding adult sexting and non-consensual image sharing. Studies to date have conflated consensual and non-consensual sexting behaviours and have poor methodological design in terms of the operational definitions used. Researchers investigating sexters’ psychological health have thus far neglected to consider individual factors (e.g. coping, resilience and sexting attitudes), interpersonal aspects (e.g. relationship context and privacy expectations) and image characteristics. Existing research is biased by the measures used (i.e. primary focus on psychological distress) and there has been limited opportunity to demonstrate positive sexting associations (e.g. relational wellbeing). We therefore sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of sexters’ psychological health and wellbeing by addressing the following questions:\r\nHow common are non-consensual image sharing experiences amongst a UK community (non-clinical) sample of adult sexters?\r\nAre there any differences in the psychological health and wellbeing of non-sexters and sexters (including those who have experienced non-consensual image sharing)?\r\nAre any sexting specific factors, such as privacy expectations, image characteristics and relationship with recipients, associated with psychological health?\r\nAre there any differences in psychological health and wellbeing between consensual sexters’, those who have experienced non-consensual sexting, and non-sexters’ when coping, resilience and sexting specific factors are accounted for?\r\nMethod: We utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design. Participants from a non-clinical adult population (N = 270) were recruited via social media. The\r\nsurvey consisted of a sexting questionnaire identifying type of sexting behaviours, relationship context, privacy beliefs and sexting attitudes; as well as non-consensual image sharing behaviours and experiences. Psychological measures used included: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales (DASS-21), the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), the Brief COPE and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).\r\nResults: 87% of the sample had engaged in sexting as an adult, primarily within committed relationships in order to maintain sexual intimacy. 14% of sexters had experienced the non-consensual distribution of their images and 16% had distributed others’ images without permission. Males and females did not differ significantly in who experienced non-consensual image distribution. Images were most often shared by someone the person was dating, typically with friends and family, although images were shared online in 43% of cases. Privacy expectations and sexting attitudes were not related to psychological health or wellbeing. When coping and resilience were accounted for, experiencing non-consensual image distribution was not related to psychological distress but individuals who were uncertain if their images had been shared had lower wellbeing, and consensual sexters who sent sexts to multiple partners had higher anxiety.\r\nConclusion: Our research suggests that the problematic coping strategies individuals employ, and their level of resilience have a stronger relationship with psychological health than do their sexting behaviours; although further quantitative research with clear consistent definitions of sexting and non-consensual image sharing is needed to identify if these findings are replicable. Clinical interventions for those who are distressed by non-consensual image distribution should focus on identifying and reducing the use of problematic coping strategies such as avoidance, denial and self-blame. Sexting may be considered a normative part of intimate relationships: Educational strategies should fully explore issues of consent and perceived gender stereotypes; as opposed to encouraging individuals to abstain from sexting as a deviant or risky behaviour (which could contribute to self-blame and victim blaming). Future research should focus on understanding specific motivations for and types of non-consensual image distribution (e.g. revenge pornography) and whether it is associated with more harmful aspects of relationships such as interpersonal violence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Ultimately, the foundations of human sexual pleasure must be biological, regardless of the triviality or momentousness of cultural influences. To give just one example, penile erection is evident in the male fetus by the thirty-eighth week in utero, long before cultural conditioning could have a significant effect. Even more suggestive is the existence of the clitoris, an organ whose sole function is to provide pleasure. Like the penis, the clitoris makes its anatomical debut well before birth. Physiological specialization for pleasure is especially evident in orgasm. One might argue that male orgasm is subservient to ejaculation, and thereby satisfies a reproductive purpose. But why then do women orgasm as well? Women can certainly ovulate and conceive without it. Moreover, women seem to achieve orgasm more readily during clitoral masturbation and oral-genital sex than during vaginal penetration. This implies that female orgasm is relatively less common during reproductive sexual activities.",

      "abstract": "Conditions of life for women in the ancient world followed from one major fact and one major assumption. The fact is that women bear children. Menstruation, pregnancy, labour, and lactation are wearing and restrict activity; contraception varied (as it did until the 1960s) from moderately reliable pessaries and spermicides to mere superstition. But women do not spend all (or, for some women, any) of their lives bearing children. The assumption was that even when they are not doing so, they must lead a domestic life under male protection, for they are not suited to independence. Women were seen as more emotional than men (a question still in dispute), more gullible, more likely to yield to impulse or desire, less rational - generally less in control of their reactions than men are. Much of this, to modern observers, is self-fulfilling prophecy. If you restrict women (or unemployed men) to domestic life, they will lack experience of the world, develop compliance not self-confidence, and have too much time to brood.",

Transgender students with physical or psychiatric disabilities face additional barriers on college campuses due to the compounded effects of prejudice towards transgender identity (transphobia) and prejudice towards disability (ableism). Transgender individuals with disabilities often experience double stigma that may involve institutional barriers such as unemployment, educational discrimination, or residential segregation (Mizock & Lewis, 2008). In addition, transgender individuals with disabilities report ableism, such as being stared at, avoided, infantilized, harassed, threatened, or ignored (Clare, 2001). Experiences of mistreatment may vary depending on the degree to which a student’s transgender identity, or physical or psychiatric disability, is visibly discernible to others.",

      "abstract": "The concept of intersexuality subsumes a wide variety of phenomena with very specific underlying causes. In all these cases, an untypical development takes place during the prenatal sex differentiation process becoming clinically manifest, either at, or soon after birth or at the time of puberty. It subsumes conditions in which biological sexual characteristics (e.g. chromosomal sex, gonadal sex, hormonal sex, morphological sex) differ from each other and one person cannot easily be assigned to one sex. One of the main goals of medical treatment of persons with intersex-syndroms is the development of a stable gender identity. Over the last few years, sex (and gender) assignment of persons with different forms of intersexuality has become a much discussed topic. An interesting--and very obviously observable--variable that was brought in connection with sex assignment is gender related childhood play behaviour. The purpose of the presented study is to examine 37 persons with different forms of intersexuality (disturbances of androgen biosynthesis, partial and complete androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis with 46,XY and congenital adrenal hyperplasia with 46,XX) with regard to gender identity and gender role behaviour in childhood. Not all subjects in the study group had developed a clear female or male gender identity. In contrast to previous studies, some persons with CAIS did not recall distinguished female childhood play behaviour and these persons did not show a clear female gender identity. In contrast to results from other studies, the CAH-affected girls in this study did not seem to recall masculinized behaviour. Further research is needed to guarantee better psychosexual development with good quality of life in individuals with intersexuality.",

All models of sexual selection assume that sex traits are costly to produce and maintain, and individuals with reduced costs of production and maintenance of secondary sexual characters would be at a selective advantage. A number of morphological, physiological and behavioural traits may have evolved as a result of their cost‐reducing properties: (1) body size, which does not change throughout life, that allows certain individuals to develop exaggerated sex traits, (2) cost‐reducing traits, such as muscle size, that improve with practice and (3) actual cost‐reducing traits, such as wing size in birds with song flight, which are produced in advance of or simultaneously with the sex trait. Cost‐reducing traits may coevolve with secondary sexual characters and allow more extreme sexual signalling than would otherwise have been possible in their absence or in reduced versions.",

Assisted conception has not only physical implications but psychological and, of course, familial and social, implications. Yet, if a woman does become obsessed, this sad state of affairs should not be attributed solely to her doctor or to medicine but must be located within the wider framework of her own psychological make-up and social conditions. In fact, all these conditions will by nature be mingled and inter-twined. Often there is a social pressure, in a wider sense, on the woman to have a child. The desire for a child is a deep-seated desire in the human heart. And the way in which it is satisfied calls for careful consideration.",

An individual's sexual behaviour can have a profound impact on the person's sexuality regardless of how this behaviour occurs, be it masturbation in isolation or penetrative intercourse with a partner. Sex per say is not always done with an aim for procreation [1]. The individual's propensity for sex can be both procreative and non-procreative. The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

      "title": "Factores psicológicos y socioculturales en la vida sexual de los adultos mayores / Psychological and socio-cultural factors in the sex life of older adults",
      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempeña un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, así que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el interés o las prácticas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino también de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfacción de una necesidad fisiológica básica, denominada como “normal” en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona más a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicológicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepción de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 años de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utilizó el método descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificación, test bienestar psicológico y la satisfacción sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tardía, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, versión para adultos. El análisis de datos se realizó mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de cálculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 años de edad. En los resultados se encontró que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicológico, no intervino en su percepción de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayoría de la población manifestó tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influyó de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se preguntó a los adultos mayores en estudio: ¿cree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contestó en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les preguntó si en la actualidad mantenían relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres sí tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetración o coito para obtener satisfacción sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetración para obtener satisfacción sexual. En conclusión, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual están inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atención suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas más jóvenes.",

      "title": "Grievances, Individual and Mobilizing",
      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them—such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock—can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements—such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or well‐being of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly other motivational factors—such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure—may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

The more widespread issue of prejudice is an individual attitude which may invoke race, but is as likely to be related to some other 'stigma'-generating marker.

      "abstract": "APRESENTACAO: A sexualidade e descrita como um processo inerente e indissociavel a essencia humana, que comeca ao nascimento e so termina com a morte do individuo, desta forma e evidente que nao se restringe apenas a pratica do ato sexual como e, geralmente, idealizado pelo senso comum, mas a um amplo espectro emocional que envolve afeto, caricias e principalmente o sentimento mutuo, entre outros fatores que se modificam, em consonância com o desenvolvimento do ser humano. Assim nao e a idade que determinara a presenca ou ausencia da sexualidade, mas a vontade do individuo de instiga-la.  E inevitavel que o envelhecimento acarrete uma diversidade de modificacoes anatomicas, fisiologicas e psicossociais que, por sua vez, nao inibem o processo sexual, porem excita nas pessoas a criacao de mitos e tabus preconceituosos relacionados a “velhice assexuada”, ou seja, ocorre a desvalorizacao da sexualidade no tocante a terceira idade, entao os senis se desestimulam e ate proclamam-se incapazes de prosseguir sua vida sexual mesmo que o exercicio desta maximize o bem-estar, influencie na manutencao da saude e corrobore para o reconhecimento do anciao enquanto ser ativo e funcional na sociedade.  Desta forma o objetivo da pesquisa foi conhecer e analisar a vivencia da sexualidade na terceira idade, a partir de idosas vinculadas ao centro de Convivencia de Idosos (CCI) no municipio de Santarem-PA. METODOLOGIA: Trata-se de um estudo de campo com embasamento bibliografico, de cunho quantitativo executado em um centro de convivencia de idosos no municipio de Santarem, no Estado do Para, Brasil. O universo amostral foi composto por 25 mulheres compreendendo a faixa etaria de 60 a 80 anos, que frequentassem assiduamente a referida instituicao, estivessem lucidas, sem nenhum tipo de alteracao psicologica que pudesse comprometer o andamento da pesquisa e todas as participantes deveriam residir em Santarem. Mediante a regularizacao etica foi aplicado um questionario fechado a fim de obter as informacoes referentes ao estudo para posterior analise. RESULTADOS: De acordo com a analise dos dados constatou-se que 44% das mulheres encontravam-se na faixa etaria entre 66 a 70 anos de idade, 24% entre 60 a 65 anos, 20% dentre 76 a 80 anos e 12% entre 71 a 75 anos, destas 36% permaneciam casadas, 32% viuvas, 18% solteiras e 14% divorciadas, sendo que 81% apresentava renda media de um salario minimo, 14% dois salarios minimos e 5% outros valores, e valido ressalta que grande parte delas era catolica (96%), enquanto que 4% eram evangelicas, no quesito raca, 65% autodenominavam-se pardas, 23% se classificava branca, 8% da raca negra e 4 % de etnia indigena. 88% afirmaram que tinham filhos, enquanto que 12% nao tiveram filhos, 35% afirmaram morar com o companheiro, 30% com os filhos, 26% residiam sozinhas e 9% alegaram moram com os netos, quanto ao tempo de cadastro na instituicao ja referida 9% estava ha dois anos, 8% frequentavam a tres, 8% ha quatro anos e 75% eram institucionalizados a outro intervalo de tempo.   Ao que concerne a sexualidade propriamente dita 33% consideravam como obtencao de prazer, 28% compreendiam como o ato sexual/coito, 17% como ato exclusivo para funcao reprodutiva, 17% caracterizaram como desejo e 5% referiram como orgasmo. Das 25 mulheres 79% responderam nao apresentar nenhuma dificuldade ou constrangimento em discutir ou dialogar sobre sexualidade, entao, foram questionadas se consideravam sexualmente ativas, onde 70% replicaram sim e 30% classificaram-se como inativas. Quanto aos obstaculos vivenciados durante o ato sexual 69% delas arguiram nao ter nenhum, 8% asseguraram sentir desconforto, 4% relataram dispaurenia, 4% vergonha e 15% afirmaram ter outras sensacoes. CONSIDERACOES FINAIS: A expressao da sexualidade na terceira idade, assim como no adulto jovem e considerado necessidade fisiologica e reflete na qualidade de vida, no entanto este processo pode estar prejudicado de acordo com significacoes culturais norteados por mitos e arguicoes preconceituosas, destarte a sexualidade na terceira idade pode e deve ocorrer de maneira satisfatoria caso busquem redescobrir e acarretar um novo significado a este processo que, sem duvida sera diferente daquele vivenciado na juventude, porem ainda tera carater prazeroso e benefico. Constatou-se que a maioria das pesquisadas compactuavam com uma vida sexual ainda ativa e positiva, porem uma parcela menor ainda tratava a sexualidade como alheio a seu cotidiano ou apresentavam problemas no ato sexual, este feitio pode estar relacionado, possivelmente, a forma como a pessoa vivenciou a sua sexualidade, como adquiriu conhecimentos a respeito ou como foi construida sua identidade sexual, cultural e social.  Neste contexto, ressalta-se a premissa do aconselhamento a estas mulheres com a finalidade de melhorar a qualidade de vida e, consequentemente, a saude e ate mesmo daquelas que ja desempenham os atos sexuais de forma oportuna, a fim de minimizar as doencas de modo transmissivel. Outra estrategia de suporte, com suma importância seria a insercao continuada da educacao e incentivo a sexualidade, realizado pelos proprios funcionarios do centro de convivencia do idoso, pois de acordo como os dados da presente pesquisa, grande percentagem participa frequentemente do CCI a tempo significativo, viabilizando as acoes em longo prazo, ratificando que e objetivo destas instituicoes promoverem a insercao e a valorizacao do idoso na sociedade, bem como auxilia-lo a gozar de seus direitos, dentre eles a saude biopsicossocial. No âmbito da sexualidade surge entao a percepcao e atitudes dos cuidadores face as mais complexas situacoes encontradas quando do apoio prestado, que nem sempre sao as mais positivas para a qualidade de vida dos idosos, e que, carecem ser compreendidas e analisadas. Fazendo-se necessario que a equipe multidisciplinar que presta cuidados aos idosos atenda-os de forma mais ampla atentando-se para as necessidades, sejam elas fisicas, psicologicas, emocionais ou sociais e assim desenvolver uma assistencia com olhar holistico e sem preconceito. Portanto, a enfermagem deve desempenhar de forma parcial este encargo atraves de palestras, rodas de conversas, discussoes em grupo, entre outras metodologias ativas, uma vez que esta diametralmente ligada a cliente seja na atencao basica ou hospitalar e esta apto a orienta-la, assim como promover pesquisas em relacao ao tema supracitado em acao conjunta as demais areas de conhecimento, considerando a relevância e importância no contexto social.",

      "title": "Die Struktur der Gleichheit – oder die Problematik der sog. „diskriminierungsfreien Tatbestände“",
      "abstract": "Up to the present, the phenomenon of equality - and thus its consolidation into an autonomous right, namely the human right of equality or equal treatment -manifests serious problems in theory and practice. As Leibniz exhibited, “equality” is not purely understandable on its own terms. In order to not confuse the phenomena’s “quality” with “identity”, a substantive (judgmental) corrective is required. If one does not want to confuse equality with identity, the determination of equality always requires a further evaluative element. Legal professionals solve this requirement in their legal systems pragmatically by implementing positivistic criterions, such as age, sex, race, that constitute “their” conception of equality in their law. However, even this pragmatic positivist approach has its shortcomings. The question arises, if the criterions, that are not part of the above mentioned positivistic catalogue [e. g.: physical ugliness, low property or financial position, low educational level] open the possibility to legally discriminate affected people. Such non-listed ‘discriminations’ already drop out of the scope of the equal treatment catalogue. Hence, they do structurally not meet the requirement of equality/non-discrimination. As this kind of discrimination does not fulfil the element of the non-discrimination norm, their legitimation does even not require a legal examination or justification of its legitimacy by a justification test. This contribution raises a number of questions that are still unanswered or sufficiently discussed. They could be solved, amongst others, by opening up “equal treatment” for a variety of “elements of discrimination”. In addition the open social questions about the justification of such characteristics, a number of aspects of the compatibility of national equality rights with other, possibly higher-ranked, legal norms - e. g. Human Rights - must be considered in this legal context. Considering that the granting of equality of one person regularly implies the loss of the freedom of another person, a more differentiated view of equality - oriented towards the rights of freedom - seems to be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "A major milestone in a woman's life is the loss of virginity, \"defloration,\" with the breaking of the hymen. Psychoanalysis has paid little attention to the meaning of defloration to either women or men, and virtually none to the hymen as a part of the female genitalia. The reasons for this disregard or avoidance are explored. Utilizing the few psychoanalytic writings, mythology, literature, and anthropological studies in addition to numerous clinical examples, the authors find that the unconscious meanings of the loss of virginity and the hymen emerge clearly. The common theme is that of negation, never, never again, never seen, known or named. Theoretical considerations regarding female sexuality are discussed. Technical implications for analyst-patient are presented.",

      "title": "¿Sexualidad en la diversidad o diversidad en la sexualidad? Nuevos retos para una nueva cultura sexual",
      "abstract": "In this paper we take a look at a small representation of what plurality in sexuality implies. Examples, such as that of women, people with functional diversity, and people of other sexual orientations and/or gender, show that there is no single sexuality, but that there are as many sexualities as there are people. People with functional diversity have suffered and suffer discrimination in all aspects of life, including sexuality.That is why, in December 2006, the United Nations approved the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The sexuality of women, men, and those who do not identify with sex-gender binarism, but all of them with functional diversity, tend to experience sexuality in a way which is to a certain extent, distorted. They are persons who are considered asexual, and consequently, treated in a infantilized way throughout their life cycle (especially, women with physical, deafblind, intellectual and/or developmental or mental diversity); or, on the contrary, some of them, in particular, women with intellectual and/or developmental or mental diversity, are interpreted as hypersexual persons who do not know how to control themselves. However, if we want to open the normative horizon to sexuality, to its science and its practices, we will include from a social and rights perspective a multiplicity of realities that are diverse sexualities, but which would traditionally have been pathologised and treated from the perspective of a disease model.Keywords: Sexuality, diversity, sexology, functional diversity, sexual rights.",

The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

In the past decade research based on a social-relational perspective has emerged. We summarize recent work from both perspectives. In addition to the effects of disease on sexual functioning of men and women over the age of 50, this review emphasizes sexual expression among older couples, newly emerging topics such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the older adult, and older lesbian and gay sexuality. Sexual functioning in both males and females continues in later life, while sexual satisfaction within their relationships is dependent upon individual responses to age-related changes. As the life course continues, some older married couples begin to desire emotional intimacy, stability, and continuity in addition to or instead of penetrative sex. This also appears to be characteristic of relationships involving two (older) women. As the world's population over 50 continues to grow there is an increasing interest in older adult's sexuality. This signals progress toward understanding healthy sexual relationships.",

It is so, first, in the sense that, worldwide, an enormous number of people are disabled. The proportion of disabled people in different national populations varies significantly with factors such as economic development, quality and availability of health care, and the age distribution of the population. (In the United States, people with disabilities make up the population's largest minority: Census 2000 found nearly twenty percent of the population over five years of age to be affected by some sort of disability [United States, Census Bureau].) Furthermore, because of the way this minority is constituted, it is arguably more diverse than those of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation.

Pairs were then separated; each member spontaneously recalled information about her partner and the experimental room and provided a record of her thoughts and feelings during the interaction. As hypothesized, all master status Ss were particularly likely to be mindful in social interactions; they recalled detailed information about the situation and often took their partner's perspective during the interaction.

However, as discussed in this chapter, constraints in development can be broadly defined. Constraints have typically been conceived of as either innate and present at birth or acquired through experience. This chapter argues instead that developmental cascades are influenced profoundly by different kinds of constraints that do not have a single foundation. Constraints can be structural (e.g., originating from the structure of the child’s nervous system and body), a function of the physical or social environment, or the result of accumulated knowledge and experience. These constraints, it is argued, occur at multiple levels of processing and change over time, both of which contribute to developmental cascades and are the product of cascades.",

The various age-cohorts differ in sport involvement from each other more among men than among women. This is examined from several angles: as a question of role or gender expectations, of different life-situations and possibilities, of different meanings and contents of sport and movement, and of different sport cultures and myths.",

      "title": "A cooperative function for multisensory stimuli in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate",
      "abstract": "Intrasexual competition is an important element of natural selection in which the most attractive conspecific has a considerable reproductive advantage over the others. The conspecifics that are approached first often become the preferred mate partners, and could thus from a biological perspective have a reproductive advantage. This underlines the importance of the initial approach and raises the question of what induces this approach, or what makes a conspecific attractive. Identification of the sensory modalities crucial for the activation of approach is necessary for elucidating the central nervous processes involved in the activation of sexual motivation and eventually copulatory behavior. The initial approach to a potential mate depends on distant stimuli in the modalities of audition, olfaction, vision, and other undefined characteristics. This study investigated the role of the different modalities and the combination of these modalities in the sexual incentive value of a female rat. This study provides evidence that the presence of a single-sensory stimulus with one modality (olfaction, vision, or ‘others’, but not audition) is sufficient to attenuate the preference for a social contact with a male rat. However, a multisensory stimulus of multiple modalities is necessary to induce preference for the stimulus over social contact to a level of an intact receptive female. The initial approach behavior, therefore, seems to be induced by the combination of at least two modalities among which olfaction is crucial. This suggests that there is a cooperative function for the different modalities in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate.",

      "abstract": "L’automutilation demeure mal comprise malgré son intérêt médico-judiciaire et social. Même si ce phénomène chez les malades mentaux est reconnu depuis plusieurs années, la documentation sur cette question est loin d’être suffisante. Au niveau des consultations médico-judiciaires (CMJ), les personnes présentant des blessures ayant des caractéristiques auto-infligées affirment avoir été conséquences d’agressions. Ces blessures sont utilisées comme preuve matérielle afin d’engager des poursuites judiciaires au tribunal pénal ou constituent une menace contre une personne innocente. Les blessures auto-infligées (BAI) sont évocatrices par leurs caractères. Cependant, aux allégations on note souvent une discordance lors de la reconstitution des faits. A l’examen clinique, ces blessures sont superficielles avec une profondeur égale aux extrémités. Souvent, uniformes (linéaires ou légèrement curvilignes), groupées, parallèles et se croisent entre elles, orientées dans la même direction, symétriques au niveau des zones accessibles par la personne (évitant les zones mortelles ou sensibles à la douleur et le côté dominant). La présence de blessures d’hésitation et l’existence d’ancienne cicatrice d’automutilation sont un signe évocateur. Elles peuvent être surajoutées à des blessures légères causées par un agresseur, dont le but est de majorer une incapacité totale de travail (ITT). Parfois, ces blessures se trouvent en postérieur du corps sur une zone accessible par la personne ou causées à l’aide d’une tierce personne (complice). L’examen des vêtements a une grande importance dans le diagnostic médico-légal des BAI (absence d’entaille vestimentaire en regard de la blessure ou l’entaille ne correspond pas). En médecine légale, la problématique majeure de ces BAI demeure essentiellement sur le diagnostic médico-légal pour les cas particuliers et la rédaction d’un certificat médical initial de constatation de blessures, notamment en matière de fixation d’ITT. Le diagnostic médico-légal de BAI a une importance judiciaire notamment en matière de différenciation entre une agression, une simulation et autres types de comportement autodestructeur. Il permet aussi une rédaction d’un certificat médical adapté évitant une enquête inutile par le service de police ou de gendarmerie, d’innocenter un présumé agresseur et de soulager son inquiétude ou son anxiété injustifiée. C’est une étude incluant des personnes portant des BAI récentes pour avantage judiciaire. En fonctions des données situationnelles de cette étude, nous allons tenter de cerner le caractère médico-légal de ces blessures notamment leurs formes.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is considered an essential element of human nature, not only in its procreative aspect but also, and above all, as an affective manifestation of the establishment of relationships with another human being.In turn, the gender has been an important issue, particularly in the last thirty years since it has been linked mainly to the human rights.In the various declarations and plans approved at the different United Nations World Conferences, the evolution of this concept, and of others associated with it, has been raising questions with implications at the most diverse levels.These implications can be internal to each individual or in societal and cultural terms and in their organization, such as in the legal aspects, and, above all, in the way we think and experience the society in which we are inserted.Sexuality, however, may also be considered as the inter-relation of gene and hormone systems that will determine the formation of genitalia, that will eventually imprint the neuronal systems where the affective manifestations take place.However, sometimes the genetic sexuality is not in conformity with the self-definition of gender.This discrepancy may be related with some neuronal systems related with the definition of self, in the construction of each own identity, and the relationship with other people.If medicine has a saying in this matter, the psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic thinking have an essential role, which is paramount in promoting reflection on gender issues, whether in identity, or in the experience of sexuality as a whole.This reflection will allow the constitution of itself as a science that is not restricted to psychology, but that encompasses several areas of knowledge, allowing, through the free association method, to analyze and reflect on the essence of the human being.In this presentation, these two issues will be addressed and confronted.",

The article shows that sex, indeed, is not just a partial object, of the phallic type, or a genital organ, but also an object of the ideal type embodying the potentialities specific to each of the two sexes. This explains why, in analysis, the ideal sexuality, based on that idealisation of sex, prevails outright over the two other forms. In “transfer love”, the analyst or the analysis firstly embody the ideals in question and it becomes problematic if the analysand does not manage to detach them from their person or from the situation, so as to invest them in full knowledge – a necessary evolution too in married life.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The review assesses recent research and its impact on understanding of intimacy and sexuality in older adults with dementia. Recent findings There is no universally accepted definition of inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISBs), but they have been divided into overt acts associated with increased libido and uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or other people. Couples affected by dementia frequently maintain physical intimacy. Nonintercourse intimate activities may be preferred over intercourse. Early therapeutic interventions may assist partners in modifying activities, behaviors, and expectations about the future of the relationship. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are commonly due to the disruption of interconnected brain structures. Trauma to the temporal lobes may lead to hypersexuality and ISB. Trauma to the limbic system can produce changes in sexual preference. Both temporal and frontotemporal dementias, or either of them, often present with socially and sexually inappropriate behaviors. Huntington's disease can exhibit hypersexuality, pedophilia, promiscuity, and marital infidelity. The involvement of the medial striatum of the basal ganglia in this disease explains the prevalence of ISB. There is no consensus regarding first-line pharmacotherapy for ISB. Little information is known about the adverse effects. Summary Clinicians and society need to consider how dementia might affect physical intimacy.",

      "title": "Psychosexual problems.",
      "abstract": "Individual anxieties about sexuality remain surprisingly repetitive despite changing public attitudes toward sexuality. This discussion includes case histories which demonstrate the indirect presentation, using nonverbal and physical cues, adopted by some patients who experience difficulty in verbalizing their sexual problems. When seeking contraceptive consultation, the patient must have no conscious or unconscious anxiety about her desire for sexual pleasure without pregnancy and is entitled to assume, when seeking such advice, that the doctor who offers it has no such prejudices either. When the presenting symptom relates to otherwise illogical contraceptive difficulty, or otherwise invites examination of the genitals, one may suspect that the problem may be sexual and too difficult to express in other than the physical language the patient expects the physician to want. For a couple whose sexual life is comfortably confident and provides pleasure, any contraceptive method will serve its purpose of removing the fear of pregnancy. Such a couple may be advised on logical grounds. For the rest, an open-ended comment such as \"I wonder what the real worry is\" usually leads to the true anxiety. Yet, at this point, the doctor's anxiety often replaces the patient's since the management of psychosomatic disorders is not part of normal medical training. The temptation to send for the partner and advise a program of relearning, or to make referral to a sex therapy clinic which will do likewise, is strong for any busy doctor who has no psychosexual training. Skill in dealing with such common dilemmas in the context of the brief period allotted to each patient cannot be obtained from a short article, but it is worthwhile for a physician, confronted with a patient whose symptoms do not make sense, to ask what the symptom itself may indicate in terms of the unspoken problem at hand. Most family doctors who understand the training of the Institute of Psychosexual Medicine find their brief psychosomatic approach more appropriate to their everyday work than time-consuming behavioral sex therapy and more appropriate to patients who present their problems in the surgery. Such patients usually are troubled with their individual vision of their personal sexuality. Those who have no inclination for such training will make more accurate diagnoses if they are aware that nonverbal clues may say more than words and that referral to a colleague trained in psychosexual medicine may be more fruitful than one which only reinforces the patient's sense of inadequacy and abnormality.",

      "abstract": "A sentence of imprisonment exists in all modern systems of criminal law sanctions. Having in mind that this sentence is realized only in a process of its execution, the execution presents its crucial phase. Relatively high standards applied in the regime for execution of a penalty of deprivation of liberty (especially in women's prisons) are established by legal regulations this day as a result of general civilizing achievements to respect human rights and to protect these who are sentenced. Nevertheless, we are still facing the issue whether it is possible to prepare a person deprived of liberty for the life in liberty. That is to say, isolation, segregation, locking up in special institutions with detailed rules of conduct, which are essentially different from life demands in a social community, create an artificial and unnatural life environment. After a certain period of time, breach of social communication and in general having no contact with the life out of prison walls leads to internal lack of liberty and more severe psychical, emotional, intellectual and more often health problems. In everyday routine and monotony of the convict existence deprived of having choices, making decisions and being challenged and responsible, writing becomes one of the most truthful modes to preserve and protect personality. It secures connections with the outside world and it is a way of nourishing the sensibility of woman's nature in a rigid prison rules encirclement. Making a decision to express herself by a written word, woman is leaving her passive role of being an object and becomes at least partially an active party of her own resocialization while beginning to communicate with herself and the world that surrounds her. In such a manner, woman maintains and even develops her creative potentials. A possibility to express her deepest feelings, fears, desires, hopes, considerations, critics... provides for her the energy to survive in conditions of isolation. These possibilities, as a part of the organized program for resocialization, exist only in some women's prisons. This article analyses available texts written by women prisoners in female incarcerations in Germany, Slovenia, Macedonia and Yugoslavia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In a number of countries, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa, many women practice so-called \"dry sex\" usually by instilling vaginally various astringent substances to dry up the normal lubrication fluid created by sexual arousal and give the impression the vagina is still virginal tight and \"hot\". This behaviour is normally undertaken to conform to male-dominated cultural concepts that vaginal lubrication fluid (\"wet sex\") putatively indicates female infidelity, possible infection, licentiousness, coldness and makes coitus less pleasurable because of reduced friction. Many of the chemical substances employed for this can produce damage to the cervical and vaginal epithelium and thus possibly facilitate infection and transmission of HIV although no causal relation between possible damage and disease transmission has yet been definitively established. Few studies, however, have been conducted to examine the actions of the substances on vagina/cervical structures and their many functions.",

Fliess, the term “secret” (geheim, geheimnis) appears frequently, hence its weight and significance in psychic life, and implicitly as a form of intimacy and of confidentiality shared in the analytical relationship. The need and ability to keep a secret, but also the ability to confess, to share a secret, are mainly related to a certain elaboration of the sexual register, pre-oedipal and oedipal, of the elaboration of the traumatic, of the affects of shame, humiliation, guilt, as well as their impact on the psychic life of the subject, how they marked the subject’s existence and relationships. Another essential dimension is the inter- and transgenerational transmission of family “secrets” – often violent, incestuous experiences, such as severe diseases, genetic abnormalities, murders, suicides – transmitted over two, three or more generations, unconsciously. This work aims to reveal the secret’s dimension of life in clinical practice, as well as the deadly dimension of secrets and their vicissitudes in transfer-counter transference.",

      "abstract": "The uncontrollable retractability of the testes during cold, fear, anger, sexual arousal, and defecation is the basis for castration anxiety and fear of object loss including body parts. The scrotum is associated with the anal area, which is considered \"dirty,\" leading to the concept that sex is \"dirty.\" Because of the fear that a testicle can fall off, boys tend to achieve bowel training later and with more difficulty than girls. Hor monal changes in prepuberty and puberty, which cause increased size and sensitivity, also increase the masturbatory urge. Feeling guilty about masturbation, a boy may think that he has damaged his sac and testes when he perceives that the left testicle hangs lower than the right, a normal state. In cases of cryptorchidism, both sterility and homosexual problems play an im portant role: physically, if bilateral, sterility and feminizing of the male ensue; psychologically, he develops a depression about his procreative inability and fears homosexual attack. Such attacks are more likely to happen to the cryptor chid boy. The pediatrician is urged to regularly examine the boy in various positions, particu larly before age six. We must caution the pediatrician that his tendency to make a cursory examination may be caused by fears of being accused of making homosexual overtures.",

There are many myths surrounding ageing and sexuality fuelled by assumptions that libido and sexual needs decline along with the loss of culturally valued signs of beauty or handsomeness. By 75–85 years of age, only one-quarter of the population is sexually active; the reasons for this are many and include psychosocial factors such as loss of a partner, age-related physiological changes and illness. In older women, the major problems are reduced libido, poor lubrication and inability to climax. In males, erectile dysfunction is the central problem. Health problems are the major reason for a decline in sexuality with ageing. Drugs for the management of erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) and new delivery systems to treat low libido (patches, nasal, gels, injections of testosterone) are revolutionizing sexuality in older persons. There is increased awareness of the special needs of the older homosexual. Paraphilias are life-long and do not necessarily disappear with ageing. Management of inappropriate and aggressive sexual behaviours in older persons with dementia is a major problem.",

Trying to define it, you can say that taboos are not just what cannot be named, what cannot be done, but also what cannot be thought of. This term is connected with a strong ban and fear. Sexual life, along with all its forms, ranging from debauchery to restraint, from promiscuity to asceticism, from what falls within a norm to pathology, connected with such topics as eroticism and procreation, is an ambiguous, shameful and hidden area of human experience. Sexuality is the source of elementary human shame. It is sometimes impure because it is related to the lower half of the body, it is sometimes violent, it may cause disorder, fighting, jealousy. On the other hand, however, it is perceived in terms of procreation as a lofty act of giving life. All manifestations of sexuality have become a taboo. This paper discusses potential breaking of sexuality taboos in the social context.",

With as many as 15,000 individuals incriminated and 2,500 convictions for homosexual acts in little more than the last forty years of the fifteenth century, sodomy was no “deviant” behavior of a distinct sexual minority but a common part of male experience that had widespread social ramifications. The significance of sodomy lies not only in these impressive numbers, however. The hierarchical configuration of pederasty, for example, with its rigid code of sexual comportment, itself embodied and expressed social divisions and rank. As David Herlihy first proposed, moreover, the very social structure of Florence, with its late age of marriage for males of around thirty or thirty-one, a large proportion of men who never married, and the resulting profusion of footloose, profligate bachelors—those merrily singing about doing the euphemistic “born, ba, ba”—probably helped create favorable conditions in which sodomy and other unauthorized sexual activities flourished. Certain social dimensions of sodomy, real or perceived, also influenced the apparatus for policing it, as in 1459 when fines were reduced in response to the alleged ubiquity of the practice among craftsmen and the poor, or again in the early sixteenth century when penalties were scaled by age to the advantage of youths. As precise a definition as possible of the social composition of males incriminated for sodomy, then, should contribute to a better understanding of the nature and organization of homosexual activity and illuminate social tendencies and prejudices in its control.",

It argues that there are few ideas in a man's mind designed to demean woman or to idealize her which are not linked to overt or covert neurotic problems. A phenomenological description of such ideas would be endless. One has only to think of certain significant masculine reactions to a woman's figure, her sexual organs, menstruation, defloration, childbirth, breast-feeding, and even the menopause. The dominant aspect of sexual mythology concerning women is the image of woman as a deficient man. Femininity, experienced as a deficiency, an absence, a near-proof of castration, is subject to questioning much more than masculinity. The female sex is the essential enigma, only to a slightly lesser degree for the girl than for the boy.",

These identities include but are not limited to androgyny, genderqueer, genderfluid, gender nonconforming, and genderf*ck. Increasingly, nonbinary has become its own free-standing identity, without many of the historical connotations that genderqueer, for instance, might invoke. Nonbinary people identify themselves with gender-neutral pronouns or a fluid mixture of gendered pronouns in social practices. Some transition and take on embodiments that have a particular gendered aesthetic. This may or may not include sexual reassignment surgeries and other procedures that are body confirming. In short, nonbinary people have varied and robust social lives. The umbrella category of “trans” helps to situate some of the meaning and history of gender-non-normative identities. On the one hand, it can be a productive political vehicle that mobilizes communities of similarly felt histories toward collective action. On the other hand, it can limit the range of recognized embodiments and practices that have participated in the historically pertinent conventions that trans describes. The history of nonbinary identities is then a complex prospect. Such identities alter the categorical assumptions that underscore transsexual and transgender identities within binary terms. The complex narratives and histories of nonbinary trans identities raise some timely questions about the conventions of sex/gender in contemporary life. What constitutes one’s enduring sense of gender now that the binary itself has come under dispute? Should the gender binary be protected and for whom? In what varied ways do nonbinary identities alter a commonly shared imaginary of the bodily aesthetic? What role does desire play in the ongoing social changes in this long revolution of the body? The politics that emerge from these questions are becoming increasingly pressing as technology can now link otherwise isolated people across global boundaries. And finally, the reception of nonbinary identities offers important spaces of dialogue about the proliferation of identity politics, political movements, and the social divisions of labor these forces demand.",

The common denominators underlying these various systems consist of unrealistic beliefs that set off and maintain unrealistic fears that heterosexual functioning and graficiation will be hurtful to self. Distortions of beliefs and convictions about sexuality are established in childhood as a consequence of adverse influences on sexual development. Destructive attitudes are usually exerted by parents but also by other power figures in and outside the family. The most common sexual disorders seen in the general population are dysfunctions such as impotence, premature ejaculation, frigidity, and other operational problems; however, psychological difficulties linked to sexual behavior, though not usually recognized as sexual, are far more common— falling in love, maintaining long-term love relationships, resistance to marriage, and postpartum reactions.",

Virtually all of its phases have been shown to be the primary target of one or more non-mutagenic exogenous agents (Table 1).

Mutagens disrupt this cycle at some points, but the overwhelming majority of reproduc tive and developmental toxins are not mutagenic. As in all aspects of toxicology, the reproductive and developmental effects of chemicals are determined by the intrinsic nature of the chemical, the quantity of the chemical exposure, the duration of exposure and the stage of the cycle at which it occurs. Signs of repro ductive toxicity range from reduced fertility to spontaneous abortion. Adverse effects on the conceptus are categorized as functional deficits, developmental retardation, structural abnormality and death. One or more of these is anticipated to occur as a result of excess exposure to most chemicals.

Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late. While early pubertal onset in boys is likely to have beneficial effects, in girls precocious pubertal timing may have a negative impact on body-image, affect (or emotional well-being) and sex-role expectations. Other individual biological predispositions and genetic endowment may interact with social factors (e.g. peers, parenting style, neighbourhood) making adolescence either an adaptive or a challenging transition. There is a lack of sufficiently large longitudinal studies that have been able to study this interaction between genetics, biology and social environment on adolescent development. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of pubertal timing on social behaviour. Planned assessments and concepts are outlined.",

Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake and Kingsley, 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviant is a formal violation of the rules. Although the wording of reactivists and normative definitions appear similar, each conceptualization focuses attention on very different aspects of deviance: the normative definitions focus on the person who engages in norm‐violating behavior while reactivist definitions focus on the social audiences that define deviants.",

      "abstract": "The creation or enhancement of intimacy is a goal that is widely sought in contemporary Western life and in many therapeutic and enrichment programs with couples and families. In this paper, intimate experience is conceptualized within a developmental, or epigenetic, framework of relational systems, viewed from an evolutionary and historical perspective, and considered in the light of hypotheses about gender differences. Intimacy recurs most reliably, not when it is demanded as a primary or continuous experience, but when it emerges spontaneously within a context of basic, well‐functioning relational processes.",

Health is both physical, mental and social well-being, and it also includes understanding sexual health.

Sexual health is also one of the determinants of the quality of life and the feeling of happiness in a relationship with a partner. Human activities to satisfy \"sexual need\" are complex - they involve many different mechanisms and extend far beyond sexuality itself. Therefore, in phylogenetic terms, only in the case of the human species is eroticism that includes sexuality together with the sphere of feelings, intellect and the sphere of the psyche. Human sexuality is the sphere of emotions and behaviors aimed at sexual intercourse and is one of the basic ways of human freedom.",

      "title": "Moments of Pleasure: A Preliminary Classification of Gustatory mmms and the Enactment of Enjoyment During Infant Mealtimes",
      "abstract": "The enjoyment of food and the sharing of mealtimes is a normative cultural and social practice. Empirical research on eating enjoyment has, however, been a rather neglected area across the social sciences, often marginalized in favor of health or focusing on individual preferences rather than shared enjoyment. Even with regards to children, their enjoyment of food is typically rated retrospectively via parental reports of mealtime behavior. What is missing is an understanding of how enjoyment becomes a normative, cultural practice during mealtimes. This paper examines this issue in the context of parents feeding their five- to eight-month-old infants in the family home, since it is within this context that we can see the early emergence of normative practices in often highly routinized situations. The enactment of eating as enjoyable, and of the food as appreciated or 'liked' in some way, is a culturally normative practice that becomes recognizable through particular non-lexical ('mmm', 'ooh') or lexical ('this is nice, isn't it?') utterances. The data comprise 66 infant mealtimes video-recorded over almost 19 hours, from five families living in Scotland. The analysis uses discursive psychology and focuses on the sequential position of different types of parental gustatory mmms as produced during the infant meals. A classification of four types of mmm were identified in the corpus – announcement, receipting, modelling and encouragement mmms - each associated with features of sequential and multimodal organization within the mealtime. In the majority of instances, mmms were uttered alone with no other assessment terms, and parents typically produced these as an orientation to the enjoyment of their infants', rather than their own, eating practices. The receipting mmms, for instance, occurred at the precise moment when the infant's mouth closed around the food. It is argued that eating enjoyment can be considered as much an interactional practice as an individual sensation, and that non-lexical vocalizations around food are an essential part of sensory practices. The paper thus aims to bridge the gap between cultural and psychological studies of eating enjoyment and contribute to developmental studies of infant feeding in everyday interaction.",

Moreover, your well-being was at best a secondary concern. What mattered then — and still today in many parts of the world — was less a matter of personal fulfillment and more a matter of your family’s material wealth and social standing.

      "title": "Rejuvenating Sexual Health Holistically: An Approach in Ayurveda",
      "abstract": "Sex is one of the three primary human instincts, with self-preservation and social instinct, and is thus well developed in the typical individual. Sexual Dysfunction is referred to as problems that a person or partner encounters during any phase of typical sexual activity - physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal, or orgasm. A person’s inability to participate in a sexual relationship as they would wish is how the World Health Organization describes sexual dysfunction. It can affect both men and women and may be caused by physical, or psychological factors. Sexual dysfunction, if not addressed promptly, can significantly impacts fertility. Since sexual dysfunction usually coincides with anatomical as well as psychological factors, a comprehensive sexual history, evaluation of general health, and reproductive health, and identification of any additional sexual problems (if any) are critical while diagnosing sexual dysfunction. The concept of sexual dysfunction is not new to Ayurveda. Classics include various references to it in the context of Yoni Vyapads, Dosha Vriddhi, Kshaya, Ojus, Artava Vaha Sroto Viddha Lakshana, and Manovikaras, along with probable causative factors and solutions. Ayurveda addresses the anatomical, psychological, and endocrinological aspects of sexual dysfunctions. Following Dinacharya, Rajaswala Paricharya, Garbhini Paricharya, and Sutika Paricharya provide extensive treatment regimens by focusing on the overall health of an individual’s reproductive, psychological, and endocrinological well-being. Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that requires a holistic approach. Modern medical treatments offer targeted solutions, while Ayurvedic therapies promote balance and long-term vitality.",

On the basis of the different definitions suggested, some reflection avenues open up for therapists trying, sometimes in vain, to attract adolescents to their “merchandise” and make them loyal customers. There is a clinical expression, “the adolescent not for consumption,” or who is at least viewed as such by those close to him, and who removes himself from all forms of psychotherapeutic appetence addressed to him. The fantasy of consumable subject/object which underlies this strategy of avoidance warrants investigation. In the most worrisome situations, this fantasy betrays an adolescent who is not fit for consumption on account of his refusal of the sexually differentiated body or of becoming an adult. The ultimate question is that of what therapeutic setting can be tolerated by an adolescent in this register.",

These transitions have important emotional-aVective dimensions, but they also rest on the biological changes of puberty, which eventually culminate in sexual maturity. Beyond the obvious functional implications for sexuality and reproduction, biological concepts and processes historically have been central to developmental theory and are at the core of the concept of change (e.g., Harris, 1957). Some classic biologically based theories (e.g., Freudian models) reXect predetermined epigenetic models of development in which biology is viewed as driving development, and unidirectional structural and functional development is assumed (Gottlieb, 1998). Although these models are compatible with what Petersen and Taylor (1980) labeled \"direct eVects\" models, in which the physiological changes of puberty, for example, may directly aVect adolescent interests or behavior, they are not synonymous, as \"direct eVects\" do not necessarily imply unidirectional action.",

      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity. This content downloaded from 157.55.39.235 on Fri, 07 Oct 2016 06:09:55 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Early Influences on Development A second major self-righting tendency might be found at the societal level. To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

La violacion, la conducta respecto del embarazo resultante, el trato otorgado a quienes proponen y a quienes niegan el aborto por esta causa y la autocensura sobre el tema comparten el denominador comun de la violencia. Es violento todo comportamiento voluntario que quebranta lo razonable, se impone mediante maltratos, presion fisica, psicologica o moral y ofende, amenaza o dana la integridad de individuos, seres o personas. Asume variedades que se vinculan y potencian. Se ejerce violencia directa fisica y/o verbal cuando un emisor agrede fisica o mentalmente a alguien o a algo. Tal el caso del abuso de autoridad. Se acepta que existe una violencia indirecta, de contenido simbolico, que admite representaciones culturales y estructurales. Las comunidades comparten argumentos compuestos por mandatos emocionales que se sintetizan en “manifiestos“ culturales. Los elementos violentos que pudieran contener originan la violencia cultural, que ofrecen premisas para justificar presiones, criticas o aun amenazas que los “guardianes o custodios del ideario grupal” aplican a quienes desacuerdan con los preceptos. Las imposiciones son capaces de silenciar opiniones de quienes temen ser sancionados y asi, se autocensuran. El establecimiento de normas basadas en los conceptos antecitados genera la violencia estructural. Esta legitima agresiones de todo tenor como actos de “justicia”. Las posturas extremas en pos de “intereses superiores” (alguna fe religiosa o creencia politica) que no admiten disenso ni desacuerdo aceptan como “excusa” de la violencia la existencia de “pasiones desbordadas”. Estos paradigmas de violencia son capaces de impulsar guerras santas o atentados terroristas y provocar hambre, miseria, enfermedad o incluso la muerte de semejantes. La violencia directa no es innata. Emerge en un pot pourri socio-cultural como producto personalizado, aprendido y aplicado en escenarios donde el hecho se defiende y justifica, contenido en circulos viciosos de dificil solucion1 . “El hombre...es lo que la educacion le hace ser”, aseguro Kant. Carente de sostenes cultural y estructural solo cabe a la violencia rechazo y condena. Hoy, la condicion esencial del ser es la autonomia, la individualidad del sujeto se considera sustantiva y se insiste en fundar la responsabilidad personal en la pretendida, meneada, exigida y manoseada libertad. Los argumentos racionales para la toma de decisiones, son necesarios en este contexto. Aunque sobran disensos, cabe preguntarse si alguna violencia responde a deseos “secretos” de alguna comunidad2.

      "title": "Nonconsensual Insemination: Seminally Transmitted Diseases as Intimate Partner Violence",
      "abstract": "Some men use sex to damage women. These men willfully, i.e., intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or wantonly, transmit sexually transmitted diseases (STD’s) to their partners as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is heavily correlated with patriarchal attitudes that govern both partners, and especially men. Women or gay partners who subscribe to feminine sex/gender roles may be victimized by patriarchal. (This group of women and men will be denoted as “WM” in this article). Society and the justice system are influenced by two false patriarchal beliefs. The first is that condom use correlates with consensual sex and feminine sexual agency. The second is that unprotected sex indicates that insemination is consensual. Even though some states have criminalized the knowing transmission of specific STD’s and some states have only criminalized the transmission of HIV, the law has failed to deter what psychologists and criminologists have observed for decades, which is that often, men willfully contaminate an intimate partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). Irrespective of whether WM consent to unprotected sex, men who knowingly transmit STD’s to WM through ejaculation (“seminal transmission”) should be held criminally liable unless, 1) their partners specifically consented to being inseminated, and, in addition, 2) the partners assumed the risk of transmission. It is the first prong of this test that is novel with respect to current jurisprudence and social attitudes about condom use, consent, coercion, and the cycles of intimate partner violence. Using Dr. Lenore Walker’s retelling of the Cassandra myth as an analogy, first, this paper will analyze the systemic context of coercion in which WM become inseminated. In the first section, this paper presents psychological and criminological data to explain how patriarchal perspectives influence and infect society and justice. Next, this paper analyzes current seminal transmission laws, current perspectives on those laws, and how those laws fail to punish patriarchal IPV. Finally, this paper will propose a new law that recognizes nonconsensual insemination and seminal transmission as possible acts of IPV and domestic violence (DV). The proposed law suggests a penalty that empowers the victim.",

      "title": "Fenomenologi Persepsi Pelaku Perselingkuhan Undercurrent dalam Pernikahan Analisis Enklarandes Verstehen",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Infidelity has always been an interesting topic to talk about amongst peers or even a viral headline on our social media. This phenomenon is also known as an undercurrent social symptom that is based on emotional connection and leans more on the doers' biological needs. The researcher is interested in finding the perception of the doers of committing infidelity despite their legal status. The research relies on the Phenomenology of Perception and Symbolic Interactionism. Narrations, stories, and wordings are being used as a qualitative analysis of the characteristics of Enklarendes Verstehen which started with silence. Analysis was carried out through an interpretive approach. The informant's status when asked for information was still (husband/wife), had or was still having an affair Silence is crucial and effective in listening and gathering valuable information to reach an understanding of the actions of other people in doing something. The research concludes that the act of infidelity results in the doers having two opposite feelings at the same time; happy yet restless, exciting but feels so challenged and addicted such as the spice of rujak. This is aligned with the phenomenology of communication that there is no conceptual schema besides an experience to reveal the truth than an observation. Keywords: Phenomenology, Perception, Symbolic Interactionism ABSTRAK Hubungan perselingkuhan kerap menjadi topik seru bahkan viral dibicarakan dalam beranda media sosial. Fenomena perselingkuhan ini juga disebut sebagai gejala sosial “Arus bawah” (Undercurrent) yang dilandasi kedekatan emosional dan cenderung berorientasi pada kebutuhan biologis. Peneliti tertarik untuk mengetahui persepsi perselingkuhan bagi pelaku mengingat kebanyakan dari mereka telah menyandang status resmi. Penelitian ini bersandar pada fenomenologi persepsi dan teori interaksi simbolik. Narasi, cerita, kata-kata dan tatanan bahasa digunakan sebagai sumber data kualitatif yang dianalisis dengan karakteristik Enklarendes Verstehen yang dimulai dengan diam. Analisis dilakukan melalui pendekatan interpretif. Status informan saat dimintai keterangan masih berstatus (suami/istri), pernah dan masih melakukan perselingkuhan. Diam adalah cara efektif untuk menangkap pengertian dan pemahaman yang berkaitan dengan orang-orang yang berada dalam pengalaman tertentu sehingga dapat memperoleh nilai dan pengalaman yang berkualitas. Hasil dari penelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa perselingkuhan memberikan dua rasa yang berbeda dalam waktu bersamaan, senang tetapi tidak tenang, seru dan menantang bahkan menagihkan seperti pedas-pedas rujak. Sejalan dengan apa yang menjadi hakikat fenomenologi dalam komunikasi bahwa tidak ada skema konseptual diluar pengalaman langsung yang memadai untuk menyingkapkan kebenaran, hanya lewat perhatian yang sadar kebenaran dapat diketahui. Kata Kunci:. Interaksi simbolik, Fenomenologi, Persepsi",

      "abstract": "Koro is the term used to define the fear that one's sex organ is retracting into the body and that the complete retraction of the organ will result in death. While koro is found mainly among the Chinese and other Asian societies near China, the condition is most prevalent in southern China, where repeated epidemics have occurred. In that region, koro is found only among the Hans, the dominant ethnic group, and is over-represented among people under age 24 years. Koro provokes considerable anxiety in the individual in question and his/her family and neighbors, and is more prevalent among males than females. Men try to pull the penis out from the body or to prevent it from shrinking further by tying a string around the penis or securing it with a clamping device. Some Asian women have reported shrinking breasts, nipples, or labia. Relatives and neighbors of the same sex often help to rescue the organ in question, especially in applying anchoring devices. Others may also believe a person has koro and attempt to rescue their organ without the individual's consent. Injury to the sex organ, including bruises, bleeding, and infection, is common and sometimes results in permanent damage. In general, however, koro attacks are acute, brief, and tend not to recur. The 1984-85 koro epidemic in Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula is reviewed to shed light upon prevailing cultural attitudes and beliefs, news and rumors about koro, and anxiety in neighborhoods which may be causative environmental risk factors for koro. Education, age, and marital status are considered as individual risk factors. Koro in China is best described as a social sickness supported by cultural myths which tend to affect young people who are deprived of proper sex information to explain their physical development.",

      "abstract": "Cet article soutient que les femmes, considérées du point de vue de leur capacité à agir en matière de reproduction, peuvent être appréhendées comme des incarnations de la vie précaire en plusieurs sens. Elles peuvent d’abord être considérées comme spécialement responsables de formes de vie jugées précaires (comme l’embryon, le fœtus, le nouveau-né, l’enfant). Ensuite, quand leur capacité d’agir en matière de reproduction est contestée (en particulier quand l’avortement est illégal ou difficile d’accès), elles peuvent être exposées de différentes façons à des préjudices, à des torts, voire à la perte de leur vie. Quand il y a précarité dans ces deux premiers sens, la capacité des femmes à faire des choix en matière de reproduction devient elle-même précaire en un sens spécifique. Enfin, en fonction des normes contingentes qui gouvernent les conduites relatives à la reproduction, les femmes sont inégalement intelligibles ( legible ) en tant que sujet moral. À la ‘production’ du fœtus comme tel correspond ainsi la ‘production’ d’une forme spécifique d’agentivité, et plus précisément la production d’un agent responsable. Pour mettre ce point en évidence, cet article propose de réexaminer la réflexion morale des femmes confrontées à la possibilité d’un avortement, qu’a restituée Carol Gilligan dans In a Different Voice (1993). Il revient également sur les réponses au travail de Judith Butler élaborées par deux théoriciennes féministes, Catherine Mills et Fiona Jenkins, selon lesquelles le concept de vie précaire peut permettre de rendre compte du statut du fœtus, tel qu’il est produit et cadré ( framed ) par la technologie contemporaine. 2",

      "abstract": "Abstract Attachment describes the human infant's tendency to seek comfort, support, nurturance, and protection from a relatively small number of preferred caregivers or attachment figures. The capacity to form an attachment is not present at birth, but develops over time. Although infants in the first 6 months are able to distinguish among different interactive partners, they do not express an obvious preference for one caregiver over another. All of this changes at around 7 to 9 months of age. At that point, infants begin to exhibit stranger wariness and separation protest, two behaviors that herald the onset of focused attachment. Stranger wariness varies from mild reticence to outright distress, but it contrasts with the infant's comfort with an attachment figure, from whom the infant seeks comfort, support, nurturance, and protection. Separation protest describes the infant's reaction to actual or anticipated separation from an attachment figure. After these two behaviors appear, infants are attached to one or more caregivers. Once infants have developed the cognitive capacity to exhibit separation protest and stranger wariness, they may form new attachments with any caregivers with whom they have significant interactive experiences.",

We highlight how fantasies participate in the processes of unbecoming and becoming to disrupt the existing gendered boundaries/subjectivities and create new possibilities of being. The market objects, including the mundane and the excess, are operating in the becoming/unbecoming, facilitating temporal gender transformations, while at the same time creating identity residues that persist between the many gendered bodily experiences (male, female or hybrid) permeating time and space. In particular, we highlight how these identity residues can be experienced as pleasurable or risky if not managed carefully, contributing to an enhanced understanding of the affective state of in-between gender and how it intersects with gendered market objects and rituals.",

      "abstract": "1 Sex differentiates under genetic control during successive periods. Classical morphological and experimental data have shown the sexual bipotentiality of the developing structures. But, as a matter of fact, several observations indicate that both sexes are not equal or equipotential as to their developmental trends and mechanisms. 2 The developmental analysis of the body sex characteristics reveals a hormonal control. In animal experiments made by the author and by others it has been observed that many structures or systems develop along the feminine type in the absence of testes during several critical developmental stages. These structures include the genital tract, the hypothalamic centres controlling the pituitary function, the nervous structures mediating sex behaviour and possibly other tissues. The ovary is unnecessary for the feminine differentiation of these structures; in males, femaleness has to be repressed and maleness imposed by the testes. 3 The problem of gonadal sex differentiation is re-evaluated; developmental aspects occurring during normal development or in the gonads of freemartins in cattle are examined. During early sexual differentiation of the gonads, testes rapidly differentiate whereas ovaries are first characterized mainly by the fact that they do not become testes. These observations can be interpreted by assuming that in males a signal imposes masculinity on the gonadal primordia which otherwise would slowly become ovaries. 4 It is hypothesized that throughout sexual differentiation in mammals, maleness has to be actively imposed on a system which will become feminine if it escapes this control.",

Even within one culture, the nakedness often symbolises very different and sometimes arbitrarily contradictory things. It can be associated with eroticism, sanctity, aggression, a certain type of culture (from savagery to elitism), etc. Focusing on specific cinematic examples, the author examines the symbolism of naked male and female bodies in horror films. The author concludes that while nudity may serve to attract viewers to the cinema, it does not necessarily equate to sexuality. The nudity is frightening in its vulnerability, but it also shows how little we know about our own bodies. In cinema, the naked body is often tortured, objectified, manipulated or even sacrificed to maintain social order or nature's fertility. Female nudity in films is linked to fears of female sexuality and fertility. Often, the encounter with the naked female body turns out to be fatal for male characters, leading to their corporal transformation or loss of identity. In any case, the naked body is something out of the norm, it is marginal and destabilizing and so it scares us.",

      "title": "Sexual Assault and Birth Trauma: Interrelated Issues",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A host of corresponding sensations and dynamics may be present during birth and during sexual abuse. Physical, emotional and environmental similarities between the original experience of birth and sexual abuse imbue these traumas with common symptomology, feelings and life patterns. The terrain of both traumas is the body which often stores both memories and affect. Later sexual abuse traumas often become merged with earlier birth and prenatal traumas. In the therapeutic setting the symptomology, abreaction and artistic expression of these two issues can be highly similar. These issues and concerns have only been briefly dealt with in the literature. Only a handful of clinicians, consulted during the preparation of this paper, were familiar with or knowledgeable about significant psychological relationships between sexual abuse and the trauma of birth. PRIMARY THEMES OF THIS ARTICLE Childhood sexual assault is one of the later life experiences which: 1) has a particular propensity to reform a latent birth stress into full blown trauma; or 2) can further activate reverberating elements of a painfully traumatic birth creating a compounding of the birth trauma (Grof, 1985; Roth, 1987). In compounded birth trauma an incidence of sexual assault, and what has been designated as rape trauma syndrome by Burgess and Holmstrom (1974), are experienced through and layered upon earlier interpretations of the traumas of birth (Grof, 1975). 3) Similarities between sexual abuse (SA) and birth traumas (BT) predispose their issues and symptomology to interconnection in the psyche (Irving in Carter, 1991). The experience of birth and sexual abuse, and the nature of how the psyche copes with these traumas means that as separate experiences they can have a legacy of similar feelings, life patterns and symptomology. 4) Sexual assault and traumatic birth can therapeutically present in manners which for all intents and purposes appear similar. While working psychotherapeutically with either sexual abuse or birth trauma the symptomology and issues of the other trauma may simultaneously and spontaneously appear (Bernhardt et al., 1993). COMPOSITE EXPERIENCES OF A TYPICAL CLIENT The client in regression is gagging, has feelings of a weight pressing down. There is the sense of being hot, sticky and maybe even being naked. In amidst the feelings of chaos and confusion, the body feels drugged and nauseated. There are few spoken words coming forward in expression which is largely body memory retrieved from what feels like a place of darkness and betrayal. The terrified person is overwhelmed with helplessness and despair, it feels like there is no way out of an imprisonment. In the sensation of suffocation and physical torment there is fear of impending death. Indeed the original primary recourse to survival of this long ago trauma was psychic death or some form of dissociative splitting. Seeking reprieve and understanding of the rising quagmire the client struggles with the few words of, I do not know where this is coming from. Watching this scene it is clear the client is experiencing great suffering and that a request is being made to be helped through terribly painful memories. The scene just described could be a client in regression to birth or regression to sexual abuse traumas. ENVIRONMENTAL SIMILARITIES The shared metaphors, feelings and somatic expression of birth trauma and sexual abuse which can be observed in various stages of the therapeutic process are in part a result of their similar original environmental conditions. Bass and Davis (1994) in Courage to Heal: A Guide for Women Survivors of Sexual Abuse, reassures survivors that as sexual abuse memories surface, You may physically reexperience the terror, your body may clutch tight, or you may feel that you are suffocating and cannot breathe (p. 83). This sounds quite similar to Khamsi (1987) in Birth Feelings: A Phenomenological Investigation reporting that when birth memories surfaced, Subjects reported having felt crunched, crushed or squished . …",

      "title": "Period Poverty: An added poverty in humanitarian crisis",
      "abstract": "The term 'period poverty' is broadly used, indicating an individual's need for menstrual products without sufficient funds to purchase them (1). Period poverty is defined as “a lack of access to menstrual products”. More than half of the world's population are menstruating people; therefore in a situation specifically during a humanitarian crisis, high-period poverty becomes challenging (2). Period poverty, like other types of poverty, is a worldwide issue and it is frequently used when people are unable to access menstrual products due to their low socioeconomic level. These items could include sanitary napkins, inner garments, and other hygiene items. It can significantly impact an individual's life, but the stigma surrounding periods poses a greater threat to women's health because it discourages people from discussing it. Several factors, including hygiene facilities, waste management, and education, pose physical, mental, and emotional challenges for numerous women. More than half of the world's population menstruates; therefore, high-period poverty becomes a challenge, especially during humanitarian crises (2). It is usually observed that adolescents and young women are frequently underrepresented populations in humanitarian settings, particularly in times of conflict like forced displacement, armed conflict, or natural catastrophes. Wherever a disaster strikes, search and rescue teams prioritize helping those evacuated to shelters and supporting efforts to provide basic necessities like food and water. As a result, other urgent needs of displaced populations, particularly displaced girls and women, may be overlooked (4). It has been observed from the global humanitarian crises, that menstruation and hygiene products such as wipes, soaps, and other menstrual products were the most important things they needed at that time (5). During the recent floods (June- Aug 2022) in Pakistan, over 33 million people were affected, and over 6.4 million required humanitarian assistance. Approximately 634 thousand people were compelled to reside in camps. Access to healthcare facilities, personnel, and essential medications and medical supplies was restricted (6)More than eight million women of reproductive age affected by floods took extreme measures to manage their periods, such as one woman who described how she had to use tree leaves during her period. (7). Post-disaster relief and rehabilitation operations rarely prioritize the menstrual hygiene needs of women. Nonetheless, there is a growing awareness of the importance of integrating comprehensive, participatory, and gender-sensitive approaches into response programs with a focus on meeting the needs of women (8). ---Continue",

      "title": "An investigation into masculine-atypical behaviour : a study among Moi university students Western Kenya",
      "abstract": "We are presented with a situation in which ‘the male identity is a fragile and tentative thing with no secure anchorage in the contemporary world’ (Brittan, 1989:3). However, empirical evidence surrounding the commonly perceived contemporary crisis of masculinity fails to support any overall crisis of masculinity thesis (Edwards, 2006:16). Instead, the different perceptions of the crisis tend to rest on at least one of the three propositions pointed out by Edwards (2006:17): Firstly; masculinity as a set of values, practices or dispositions may be suffering a crisis in so far as it is being undermined and devalued, or, moreover that masculinity per see is now to a greater or lesser degree equated with a series of negative rather than positive associations and connotations. Secondly; masculinity may be in crisis due to its perceived tendency to implore into femininity, whether through an undermining of any gender role distinctions or through feminization of some forms of masculinity as, for example, in the case of the rise of contemporary consumerist, fashion conscious or sexually uncertain masculinities such as metrosexuality. Thirdly, the crisis of masculinity may relate to the sense that masculinity in terms of the male sex role is itself ipso facto crisis-inducing. In this sense, masculinity is not in crisis, it is crisis. This study was based on the second proposition. In the patriarchal Kenyan society where gender roles are fairly traditional, and the male person perceived superior to the female and male things valued above female things, the aspect of feminization of masculinity is not just new but indeed strange. This investigation was intended to find explanations for the feminizing behaviour by males. The sex role paradigm developed in the 1970s explains acquisition of masculinity through socialization, sex role learning and social control. These mainstream theories of learning gender were explored in the assumption that they form the basis for the contemporary theories, and further, although much had changed with the times, a large part of the society still perceived gender roles from this traditional viewpoint. The masculine crisis theory and the constructionist views of gender constituted the theoretical framework of the study. This was due to the researcher’s acknowledgement that individuals were active participants in the construction of their own gender identity, and that there was likelihood for the individuals to deviate from the social expectations of what masculinity means and should be. As a result they could construct a masculinity that did not reflect normality, hence portraying a crisis. Data relating to the respondents’ perception of and reasons for feminine behaviour among young male adults was gathered from young males, young females, and both male and female parents through questionnaire and interview methods. Information about the home environment of the respondents was also necessary to help explore environmental factors that contribute to gender construction. In addition, observation was…",

      "abstract": "Few investigations of sexual attitudes have restricted their focus to individuals' preferences for specific behaviors within a heterosexual relationship. None have examined gender differences in a broad and multidimensional array of such behavioral particulars. As part of an effort to develop a measure of preferred scripts in heterosexual couples, 258 men and women reported how much they agreed or disagreed with 74 statements of preference. A reduced and factor analyzed questionnaire included 38 items and was administered to a second sample (N = 228). Results offer qualified support that, compared to women, men are more erotophilic and show a stronger preference for incorporating erotic materials as well as drugs and alcohol into sexual relations with their partner. These results were more robust in the second sample, in which almost half of the subjects were tested in same-sex groups. Across both samples, women showed stronger preferences for activities reflecting romanticism. No gender differences were evident in sexual conventionality or in preference regarding the general use of contraceptives. However, results suggest that both sexes respond more favorably to a partner-focused or unspecified contraceptive method than to a self-focused method.",

In later life, any older person is likely to have lived through several changes in which sexual identity labels are widely known, which are favoured and which considered insulting. Sexual identity labels may also mean different things at different life stages and to different people signifying, for example, desire, performance, political affiliation or partner choice. The labels someone uses to describe their own sexuality may have changed over the course of their life. Indeed, labelling one’s sexual identity at all may be a change – one consequence of the rise in the visibility of non-heterosexual sexualities has been an increased awareness of heterosexuality itself as a sexual identity (Katz, 2007). Over a long lifetime, someone’s sexual preferences may also have changed, with or without change to any labels they use to describe their identity. This makes later life a particularly fruitful site for the consideration of sexual identity labels.",

This is due to most of the children who have ever become sexual abuse victims are reluctant to be open. Therefore, parents should be able to recognize the signs of the children experiencing any sexual abuse. Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims’ health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up. The traumatic impacts of sexual abuse experienced by children are as follows: betrayal (betrayal or trust crisis of the children towards adults); traumatic sexualization; powerlessness (helpless feeling); and stigmatization. Physically, there is perhaps nothing to be questioned on sexual abuse victims, but psychologically, it can cause addiction, trauma, and even revenge. Unless it is treated seriously, child sexual abuse can lead to a broad social impacts in the society. Handling and healing psychological trauma as a result of sexual abuse should get serious attention from any related parties, such as family, society and country. Therefore, to protect children, it is necessary to provide a system approach including social welfare system for children and families, internationally standardized judicial systems and mechanisms to encourage appropriate behavior in the society",

      "title": "Categories We Die For: Ameliorating Gender in Analytic Feminist Philosophy",
      "abstract": "What it is to be gendered remains a disputed topic in feminist philosophy, not to mention in the quotidian struggle over gender categories as they are lived and questioned outside the academy. In this paper I want to explore what contemporary work in analytic feminist philosophy can tell us about how the “categories we live by,” or the categories that organize our social lives and constitute our identities, can sometimes render life unlivable because of their restrictive or oppressive effects (Kapusta; Ásta Sveinsdóttir, “Metaphysics”; Butler, Undoing 4 and Notes ). The phrase “categories we die for” captures this ambiguity. On the one hand, many of us have died, and continue to, for gender categories that we couldn't, or refused to, live up to. Think of the violence done in the name of normative and regulatory gender ideals to gender nonconformists—those who do not find a place in gender binarism (“man/woman”) or sexual dimorphism (“male/female”). Queer populations continue to be vulnerable to marginalization, pathologization, and aggression for not doing their gender, sex, or sexuality “correctly” (i.e., heteronormatively or cisnormatively). In this sense, social categories and norms can ruin lives, and we ought to argue against their restrictive regulation. On the other hand, we are also willing to stand behind, defend, and even sacrifice ourselves for gender categories that promise to make life more livable, flexible, and sustainable for those we cherish (Kapusta; Butler, Undoing ). When we fight for the recognition of categories like “genderqueer,” “trans∗,” and “agender” we seem to be saying that these are categories worth dying for (a further issue, we will see, is whether binary gender categories like “man” and “woman” per se are worth dying for, or whether the effort to make these existing categories more inclusive is). The contemporary struggle to expand the compass of gender terms and concepts, to expand the sense of the livable, seeks to make categories more inclusive. When we mobilize for trans∗ inclusiveness, gender variance, intersex visibility, and more, we are fighting for categories to be protected, in law and in life. So, to speak of “categories we are dying for,” as I will, implies both a punitive sense (“categories due to which many of us die”) and a positive sense (“categories worth dying for”). Depending on their uses and effects, gender categories can make or break one's life.",

      "title": "A sex difference in the context sensitivity of dominance perceptions",
      "abstract": "Although dominance perceptions are thought to be important for effective social interaction, their primary function is unclear. One possibility is that they simply function to identify individuals who are capable of inflicting substantial physical harm, so that the perceiver can respond to them in ways that maximize their own physical safety. Another possibility is that they are more specialized, functioning primarily to facilitate effective direct (i.e., violent) intrasexual competition for mates, particularly among men. Here we used a priming paradigm to investigate these two possibilities. Facial cues of dominance were more salient to women after they had been primed with images of angry men, a manipulation known to activate particularly strong self-protection motivations, than after they had been primed with images of angry women or smiling individuals of either sex. By contrast, dominance cues were more salient to men after they had been primed with images of women than when they had been primed with images of men (regardless of the emotional expressions displayed), a manipulation previously shown to alter men's impressions of the sex ratio of the local population. Thus, men's dominance perceptions appear to be specialized for effective direct competition for mates, while women's dominance perceptions may function to maximize their physical safety more generally. Together, our results suggest that men's and women's dominance perceptions show different patterns of context-sensitivity and, potentially, shed new light on the routes through which violence and intrasexual competition have shaped dominance perceptions.",

      "abstract": "Late modernity’s binary intrigue of child sexuality/abuse is understood as a backlash phenomenon reactive to a general trans‐Atlantic crisis concerning the interlocking of kinship, religion, gender, and sexuality. Tellingly dissociated from 1980s gay liberation and recent encounters between queer theory and kinship studies, the child abuse theme articulates modernity’s guarded axiom of tabooed incest and its projected contemporary predicament “after the orgy”—after the proclaimed disarticulation of religion‐motivated, kin‐pivoted, reproductivist, and gender‐rigid socialities. “Child sexual abuse” illustrates a general situation of decompensated nostalgia: an increasingly imminent loss of the child’s vital otherness is counterproductively embattled by the late modern overproduction of its banal difference, its status as “minor.” Attempts to humanize, reform, or otherwise moderate incest’s current “survivalist” and commemorative regime of subjectivation, whether by means of ethical, empirical, historical, critical, legal, or therapeutic gestures, typically trigger the latter’s panicked empiricism. Accordingly, most “critical” interventions, from feminist sociology and anthropology to critical legal studies, have largely been collusive with the backlash: rather than appraising the radical precariousness of incest’s ethogram of avoidance in the face of late modernity’s dispossessing analytics and semiotics, they tend to feed its state of ontological vertigo and consequently hyperextended, manneristic forensics.",

However, many medical sociologists, social epidemiologists, and other forward‐looking professionals in medicine, nursing, and public health emphasize the significance of distal factors and their roles in the origins of disease. Among investigations of health, sense of control has emerged as a particularly important variable of interest in recent decades. In studies of social factors and their ubiquitous health effects, sense of control as an explanatory concept yields valuable insights into the impacts of social factors and how these forces actually impinge on individuals’ lives. Thus this idea is an important one that helps researchers and practitioners span multiple levels of social and epidemiological analysis. Early investigations related to control yielded models related to effort–reward imbalance and job strain, which have been further evaluated and subsequently refined. However the concept is measured, it is typical that as one moves down in a particular social hierarchy, one has less control over life, work, and environment, and this control (or lack of it) exhibits measurable effects on mental and physical health.",

      "abstract": "[spa] En la actualidad los delitos de abuso y agresion sexual generan un gran rechazo y alarma social a la vez que son conductas prohibidas y castigadas penalmente en la inmensa mayoria de los paises. Pese a que los delitos sexuales tienen una prevalencia baja en relacion al resto de delitos conocidos, su gravedad y los severos danos que causan a las victimas (generalmente mujeres y ninos) los convierten en conductas criminales de alto riesgo. De ahi que la investigacion especializada haya dirigido una gran atencion a ampliar el conocimiento sobre la genesis de la agresion sexual y sobre su posible prevencion y tratamiento. Hasta el momento se han descrito numerosos deficits y carencias personales y sociales vinculados al inicio y desarrollo de la agresion sexual, tales como baja autoestima, dificultades de control emocional, deficits de comunicacion y de relacion interpersonal, aislamiento social, experiencias de victimizacion, etc. necesidades Algunos de estos elementos, a los que se ha denominado criminogenas (o factores de riesgo dinamicos), son susceptibles de mejora a traves de una intervencion psicologica adecuada. Por este motivo, las necesidades criminogenas suelen constituir los objetivos principales de los programas de tratamiento con agresores sexuales. En coherencia con ello, actualmente existen numerosos programas de tratamiento para agresores sexuales dirigidos a promover en los individuos cambios y mejoras en factores de riesgo dinamicos, de cariz cognitivo, actitudinal, emocional y conductual. Por lo que se refiere al tratamiento de los agresores sexuales en los centros penitenciarios espanoles, desde 1996 se aplica el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual (PCAS), que incluye ingredientes terapeuticos de necesidad criminogena como los siguientes: entrenamiento en relajacion mecanismos de defensa; desarrollo de la empatia con la victima; etc. muscular; restructuracion cognitiva; conciencia emocional. Segun se ha concluido en la investigacion sobre reincidencia delictiva tanto nacional como internacional, los programas de tratamiento de agresores sexuales tienen una eficacia significativa aunque de tamano moderado. No obstante, pese a que la participacion de los delincuentes sexuales en los tratamientos parece reducir su reincidencia delictiva, todavia se desconoce en gran medida el proceso individual de cambio y mejora terapeutica de los agresores sexuales que podria vincularse finalmente a una menor reincidencia. Por todo lo anterior, el objetivo principal de esta Tesis Doctoral es la evaluacion de la eficacia terapeutica del Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en los centros penitenciarios espanoles. En esta direccion, los objetivos especificos planteados en este estudio son los siguientes: (a) revisar la investigacion cientifica sobre las principales necesidades criminogenas de los agresores sexuales, con la finalidad de evaluar en que medida los programas de tratamiento contribuyen a la solucion de dichas necesidades y a la mejora terapeutica de los agresores; (b) explorar la existencia de diversas tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de sus necesidades criminogenas o de tratamiento; y, por ultimo, (c) evaluar el cambio y la mejora terapeutica en una muestra de agresores sexuales tras su participacion en el programa de tratamiento. En consonancia con los objetivos planteados en esta Tesis Doctoral, presentada como compendio de publicaciones, se integran aqui cinco estudios sobre la evaluacion y el tratamiento de los agresores sexuales encarcelados en Espana. Las principales conclusiones que se derivan de los estudios realizados son las que siguen. En primer lugar, tras la revision de la bibliografia cientifica efectuada sobre necesidades criminogenas y tratamiento, se ha podido constatar que el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en Espana es susceptible de promover cambios y mejoras en las necesidades terapeuticas de los agresores sexuales que podrian disminuir su riesgo delictivo. Paralelamente, se ha comprobado que pueden establecerse categorias y tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de la intensidad de sus necesidades criminogenas, orientadas a facilitar la aplicacion del tratamiento. Por otro lado, se ha observado una tendencia hacia el incremento de la motivacion para el cambio de los agresores sexuales a lo largo del proceso de desarrollo del tratamiento, desde estadios de cambio menos avanzados a estadios mas avanzados. Y finalmente, ha podido concluirse que la participacion de los agresores sexuales en un programa de tratamiento promueve la disminucion de sus necesidades criminogenas y su mejora terapeutica global. Sin embargo, como en toda investigacion sobre eficacia terapeutica, deben tenerse en cuenta diversas limitaciones que se han destacado a lo largo de los diferentes estudios compendiados y de esta Tesis Doctoral en su conjunto. En sintesis, aunque los resultados de estas investigaciones deben interpretarse con cautela, la conclusion general que puede extraerse es que el programa de tratamiento de agresores sexuales aplicado en las prisiones espanolas favorece en los individuos mejoras terapeuticas vinculadas a la reduccion de su futura conducta delictiva. [eng] Nowadays, sexual abuse or sexual assault crimes generate a great rejection and social alarm, since they constitute as prohibited and criminally punishable acts in the vast majority of countries. Although sexual offenses have a low prevalence in comparison with other known offenses, they need to be considered high-risk criminal behaviours due to their severity and the serious harm they cause the victims (usually women and children). So far, numerous personal and social deficits and deficiencies related to the onset and development of sexual aggression have been described, such as low self-esteem, emotional difficulties, communication and interpersonal deficits, social isolation, victimization experiences, etc. In relation to this, there are currently numerous treatment programs for sex offenders aimed at promoting changes and improvement in individuals’ cognitive, emotional, behavioural and attitude-related dynamic risk factors. Since 1996, the Sexual Offending Control Program (SOCP) is applied in Spanish penitentiary centres. For all of the above, the main purpose of this Doctoral Thesis is the assessment of the therapeutic effectiveness of the Sexual Offending Control Program applied in Spanish prisons. Accordingly, the specific objectives of this study are: (a) to review the scientific research on the main criminogenic needs of sex offenders in order to evaluate the extent to which treatment programs contribute to offenders’ therapeutic improvement and related needs; (b) to explore the existence of different typologies of sexual aggressors according to their criminogenic or treatment needs; and, finally, (c) to evaluate change and therapeutic improvement in a sample of sex offenders after their treatment participation. In line with the objectives outlined in this Doctoral Thesis, presented as a compendium of publications, five studies on the assessment and treatment of sex offenders imprisoned in Spain are included. In summary, although the results of these studies need to be interpreted with prudence, the general conclusion that can be drawn is that the Sexual Offending Control Program implemented in Spain is likely to promote changes and improvement in the sex offenders’ therapeutic needs, which could reduce their criminal risk.",

      "abstract": "Utváření lidské sexuální motivace je chápáno jako systém adaptivních mechanismů, které se vyvinuly jako odpověď na různé, někdy konfliktní, reprodukční kontingence. Je diskutováno 6 lidských sexuálních systémů. 1: Hlídání partnera a soutěž spermatu je motivací pouze pro muže, 2: V páru je pokračující sexuální receptivita ženy signálem pro kooperaci s můžem zajišťujícím jeho otcovství, čímž se zajišťuje otcovská kooperace muže. 3: Mnohočetná reprodukce je pro muže výhodná a může zvýšit jeho reprodukční úspěch. Obě pohlaví jsou vybavena motivačními mechanismy pro mimopárovou reprodukci. 4: Skrytá, neho přinejmenším nemanifestovaná, ovulace člověka podporuje stálou přítomnost a častou kopulaci, napomáhá tomu i rozložení cyklu ženy v průběhu celého roku. 5: Za vhodných podmínek může kopulace spustit neurochemické odpovědi, které posilují vazbu u obou pohlaví. Zdá se tedy, že sexuální motivace je spojena se systémem vazby, která je však dostatečně volná, aby umožňovala i mimopárovou alternativu. 6: Ženské tělo je zvláště dobře vybaveno, aby monitorovalo životní situace v souvislosti s reprodukčními možnostmi a také podle toho regulovalo fertilitu. Protože sexuální motivace je regulována stejnými hormonálními mechanismy, je propojena s ženským sledováním prostředí.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter focuses on certain filmic moments that may provide less limiting perspectives on inter-female desire – or may, indeed, herald a new ‘science’ of lesbianism – what is termed sapphology. First, it discusses scenarios that emphasise the problem not of lesbian desire, but of the socio-discursive barriers its subjects face, and usually surmount (including, prominently, the challenge of coming out to family members). Second, the chapter describes scenes of erotic arousal and jouissance (albeit not always problem free) between women. Third, moving from the inveterate, whether homo- or heteroinstantiated, ephemera of desire, it turns to love between women and its possible issue, such as creation and procreation, focusing on art as mediator of (lesboerotic) desire in the first case. Self-evidently, a lesbian couple cannot jointly conceive a child biologically, but one of the two (or indeed, both, following separate medical procedures) may now have recourse to artificial insemination within a joint commitment to lesbian parenting, with the non-biological mother assuming the role of the ‘social parent’.",

      "abstract": "There are significant numbers of well-documented cases of the following general kind. At the age of 3 or 4 a child starts to make claims about his past which clearly do not correspond to anything that has happened in his present life. He claims to remember living in a certain place, doing certain things, being with certain people, and so on. It is then found that these memory claims fit the life of a person who died shortly before the child was born. The accuracy of the memory claims is striking and there seems to be no possible normal explanation of this. The child also has certain character traits, interests and skills which correspond closely to those of the one who died; and, perhaps, a physical characteristic, such as a birthmark or wound, which closely resembles a characteristic of the earlier individual.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Among the many factors that shade and color the intensity and direction of human sexuality are gonadal integrity, chromosomal determinants, external genital adequacy, socio‐economic influences, endogenous and exogenous hormonal dependency, and possibly hypothalamic sensitization during fetal life. Neither gonads nor chromosomal sex decide the direction of overt sexual behavior. Libido, in great measure, is a chemical test‐tube equation. Testosterone is the hormone that intensifies sexual drive in both man and woman; it is particularly useful in restoring sexual drive in the woman who once knew, but has lost her libido. Testosterone in the adult female does not alter the direction of sexual behavior or amatory responsiveness. Age need not alter performance nor eliminate the satisfaction and pleasure that attend sexual gratification. Several illustrative cases are presented.",

In the context of international private law, however, the phrase has become synonymous with the unilateral removal or retention of children by parents, guardians or close family members. It bears no relation to third party abductions or what are sometimes referred to as ‘classic kidnappings’. A parental abductor rarely seeks material gain; rather, he or she will aspire to the exercise of sole care and control over a son or daughter in a new jurisdiction.",

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

      "abstract": "In literature concerning violence against children, the term â€œRitual Sexual Abuseâ€ has, for some decades, become almost always identified in a somewhat approximative way with â€œSatanic Ritual Abuseâ€. One of the most controversial issues is whether there are criteria that distinguish sexual abuse generally from sexual abuse that is specifically ritualistic. This article aims to propose a definition of ritual child abuse, specifically considering symbolic logic. Since forensic evidence often proves in such cases to be fragmentary or unreliable, it is necessary to identify the presence of certain constants, being extraneous to rational thought yet completely coherent in terms of the occult and from the point of view of the history of magic. Thus, the indicators that will be examined are those that allow us to recognise and identify a ceremonial context (ritual area, images, instruments, characters, times, etc.) and will be examined the particular motives why children are particularly sought-after victims for certain destructive cults.Keywords: ritual child abuse; Satanic ritual abuse; destructive cults; occultism.",

This review, from an ethical perspective, intends to give an overview of structural and functional neurobiological correlations of transsexualism and their course under cross-sex hormonal administration. Several studies demonstrate an increased functional connectivity between cortex regions reaffirming psychosocial distress of psychologicalbiological sex incongruity. Such distress can be ascribed to a disharmonic body image due to changes in the functional connectivity of the key components of body representation network. These brain alterations seem to imply a strategic mechanism dissociating bodily emotions from bodily images. For a number of sexually dimorphic brain structures or processes, signs of feminization or masculinization are observable in transsexual individuals, who during hormonal administration seem to partly further adjust to characteristics of the desired sex. These changes allow a reduction of psychosocial distress. However, a model leading to a ″gender affirmation″ does not solve the problem, since brain disorders causing it are not corrected. This is a serious medical ethics issue. Prejudices should be left aside. To know what happens in the brain of transsexuals is a medical need, both to define what is and what is not, and so to choose an adequate treatment, and to decide and guide legal actions.",

      "title": "‘What a Fountain of Joys’: Reproduction and Sexual Pleasure",
      "abstract": "Abstract It seems to be stating the obvious to say that pornography in the twenty-first century is about sex but not about reproduction. In the modern pornographic text (whether visual or literary) sex is represented as being for pleasure in itself, and is divorced completely from its primary purpose, the reproduction of the human race. To modern eyes, pornography and the discussion and representation of reproduction (including issues to do with the care of the woman during pregnancy, childbirth, post-parturition, and lactation) are mutually exclusive, despite having a common subject matter: sex. This was not the case, however, in early modern England, where representations of sex and the sexual body were not yet divorced from their purpose of ‘generation’.1 It is not only that the outcome of the act of intercourse was expected to be pregnancy in a period in which known methods of contraception could not be relied upon always to be successful, but that complete sexual pleasure was understood to require conception to occur.2",

      "abstract": "Even among participants, physical activity and sport seem run through with paradox—the drive (rather than walk or cycle) to the club match or the gym, the joy of movement and the focus on repetitive regularity and performance in placeless stadia and fitness centres, the claims of an 'endorphine rush' and bliss in a sterile, emotionless place devoid of leisure and in many cases devoid of pleasure. The significance of this paradox may be seen in public health responses to the lack of physical activity as an issue connected to a global rise of obesity, diabetes and other health problems. Many public health policies intended to stimulate physical activity, such as the WHO global physical activity strategy, do not deliver on expectations. As part of the project this chapter draws on, adults were interviewed about play in their life-span. At first it seemed that adults hardly played at all. However, during the interviews it became clear that they did not call their play 'play', so attention shifted from whether they play to what they play: the activity. The presence of the verb to 'play' in sports activities such as 'playing' football or 'playing' tennis indicates that a sport activity cannot exist without being 'played', yet much sport is regulated in ways that undermine playfulness. This discursive characteristic demands that we unravel the concept of play to clarify the role of play in physical activity.",

      "title": "Aging and sexuality.",
      "abstract": "Recent research suggesting that a high proportion of men and women remain sexually active well into later life refutes the prevailing myth that aging and sexual dysfunction are inexorably linked. Age-related physiological changes do not render a meaningful sexual relationship impossible or even necessarily difficult. In men, greater physical stimulation is required to attain and maintain erections, and orgasms are less intense. In women, menopause terminates fertility and produces changes stemming from estrogen deficiency. The extent to which aging affects sexual function depends largely on psychological, pharmacological, and illness-related factors. In this article I review the physiological sex-related changes that occur as part of the normal aging process in men and women. I also summarize the effects on sexual function of age-related psychological issues, illness factors, and medication use. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normal aging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouraging advice on sexuality. Although it is important that older men and women not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time.",

      "abstract": "Introduction of the 'Transgender Phenomenon' Dave King and Richard Ekins are the leading world sociologists in the field of transgender research. They have put together a brilliant synthesis of history, case studies, ideas and positions as they have emerged over the past thirty years, and bring together a rich and grounded account of this field, providing a state of the art of critical concepts and ideas in this field further during the twenty first century.¹ Based on two decades of fieldwork, life history work, qualitative analysis, archival work and contact with several thousand cross-dressers and sex-changers around the world, these researchers have distinguished a number of contemporary Transgendering 'stories'. 'The assignment of an individual as being of the male or female sex is most often based on the phenotypic appearance of the external genitalia at birth, which is largely determined by the chromosomal type (most commonly 46,XX or 46,XY). Gender identity, however, is an individual's perceived or experienced gender, which may or may not be the same as one's sex assigned at birth. The concept of gender identity includes gradations of masculinity to femininity and maleness to femaleness, as well as identification of some individuals as having nonbinary gender, which means being essentially neither male nor female, or a combination of both. Gender nonconformity is behavioral variation in gender expression (e.g., clothing, mannerisms, accessories, and hairstyles) from cultural and societal norms expected for that gender. Sexual orientation is defined as the physical and emotional attraction of an individual to same-sex people (lesbian or gay; homosexual), both same-sex and opposite-sex people (bisexual), or opposite-sex people (heterosexual).² Transgender is an all-inclusive term that may include all individuals whose gender identity or expression does not align with their assigned birth sex and/or those whose gender identity is outside of the binary male/female classification'.².",

While poststructuralist analyses of sexed embodiment describe male and female bodies as discursively constituted,1 Garfinkel’s ‘natural attitude’ persists through dominant formulations of maleness and femaleness as mutually exclusive, fixed, and essentially bound to genital appearance.2 Adding further confusion is the sense that, in an era of increasing medical ‘advances’, the opportunities for seeking the perfect body seem ever more real. ‘Our bodies have become the ultimate cultural vehicle for controlling what is within our grasp’.3 The possibility of being trapped in the wrong body is not unique to the case of transsexuality, rather, it has become a way of articulating a desire for a variety of instances of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery,4 and it has strong links with recent intersex writings.5 Nevertheless, transsexuality stands out as having been constructed, by psycho-medical and transsexual writings alike, as a case of being ‘trapped in the wrong body’. Transgenderists are now calling for an analysis of what is at stake for those who invest in this construction of transsexuality.",

The shape of an answer has now emerged. Dieting is one discipline imposed upon a body subject to the \"tyranny of slenderness\"; exercise is another. Since men as well as women exercise, it is not always easy in the case of women to distinguish what is done for the sake of physical fitness from what is done in obedience to the requirements of femininity. There are significant gender differences in gesture, posture, movement, and general bodily comportment: Women are far more restricted than men in their manner of movement and in their lived spatiality.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Definition of sexual assaultAlthough definition of violence may vary in different societies and cultures, it can be defined as all behavior that affects bio-psycho-social status of individuals.In the United Kingdom the Sexual Offences Act 2003 defines \"sexual assault\" as when a person (A) 1. intentionally touches another person (B), 2. the touching is sexual, 3. B does not consent to the touching, and 4. A does not reasonably believe that B consents (Official text of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003).In the United States the definition of sexual assault varies widely between the individual states.The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network defines \"sexual assault\" as unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape.This includes sexual touching and fondling.(Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network [RAINN], 2005) According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, \"sexual assault can be verbal, visual, or anything that forces a person to join in unwanted sexual contact or attention.\"Sexual assault is therefore somewhat of an umbrella term, and can describe many things, including:  rape, including partner and marital rape  unwanted sexual contact (touching or grabbing)  unwelcome exposure of another's body, exhibitionism, or voyeurism  child sexual abuse  incest or molestation  sexual harassment  sexual exploitation of clients by therapists, doctors, dentists, or other professionals (U.S.Department of Health & Human Services,2011). Sexual violence is described as sexually motivated behavior that exerted against one's privacy despite one's resistance.Furthermore, all sexually motivated behavior directed to low aged or mentally retarded individuals included in scope of the term of sexual violence (Christian et al., 2000; Chu&Tung, 2005;Herbert et al., 1992). Incidance and prevelance sexual assaultSexual assault is significantly underreported worldwide.Most of the rape victims do not disclose the assault because of being accused or exposed to repeated assaults. www.intechopen.comForensic Medicine -From Old Problems to New Challenges 190 Underreporting of sexual assault \"might arise from the fear of being re-victimized in the criminal justice system, of not being believed, from self-blame and from failure by rape victims to equate their experience with the legal definition of rape.\"Women may fear that they would be blamed for the assault, or believe that reporting would place them or their families in danger of retaliatory violence.A recent publication by the Open Society Institute's Network Women's Program states: \"Rape goes largely unreported across the region.The act of rape is surrounded by pejorative stereotypes: women ask for it, they provoke it by their dress or behavior, or they cry rape to take revenge on a man; normal men do not commit rape, and so on.In addition, reporting procedures, at the police station and again in the courts, are complicated and degrading.In most cases, if a woman reports being raped, she is regarded with suspicion and rarely believed; she lacks any form of police or court protection, leaving her vulnerable to retaliation-either from the offender or, in some cases, from members of her family who feel she has brought them dishonor.\"Approximately 700.000 women in the reproductive age group are victims of sexual assault in the United States and, 25,000 women are raped per year in France.Unfortunately only 16% of rapes are reported to police, however 50% of victims of rape have expressed that, they would report the rape after a warranty of secrecy about their identity (Bechtel&Podrazik, 1999;Santiago et al., 1985).Most of the rape victims do not disclose the assault because of being accused or exposed to repeated assaults (Ledoux&Hazelwood, 1995, Crowley, 1999).Despite this underreporting, available statistics indicate that sexual assault is a pervasive problem in all societies.Charlotte Bunch, in an article included in UNICEF's 1997 publication, The Progress of Nations, has stated that \"statistics on rape from industrialized and developing countries show strikingly similar patters: Between one in five and one in seven women will be victims of rape in their lifetime.\"Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Radika Coomaraswamy, in her 1997 report on violence against women, detailed the following statistics:  A Canadian study reports that 23.3% of women had been victims of rape or attempted rape. 22% of adult women in Seoul had been the victims of rape or attempted rape. In Jakarta, Indonesia, city police recorded 2,300 cases of sexual violence against women in 1992, 3,200 cases in 1993, and 3,000 in the first half of 1994. Out of 331,815 reported crimes against women in 1993 in the Russian Federation, 14,000 were rapes. A survey in the United Kingdom found that 19.4% of women had been victims of sexual violence. Adolescents constitute 20-50% of all rape victims in the United States. In a study conducted at a university in the United States, one of six female students reported having been the victim of rape or attempted rape in the past year.One out of fifteen men reported having committed rape or attempted to commit rape (Coomaraswamy, R. 1997).According to estimates from the World Health Organization: In some countries, almost one in four women may experience sexual violence by an intimate partner, and that almost one-third of young girls report that their first sexual encounter was forced.",

      "title": "Shame and Male Gender Identity.",
      "abstract": "The literature on the male gender role portrays as lacking weakness, need, doubt, or any of the female values such as sympathy, concern, or empathy. It is contended that Western society develops, reinforces, and maintains gender roles by the emotion shame; many males are motivated in part by an effort to avoid or escape shameful feelings. Shame is basically the felt variation between one's self and one's idealized self--the feeling of not measuring up. Shame arises in early childhood, before the development of certain language skills, so shame may not be readily accessible to verbally organized adult cognitions. Ironically, certain avoidance behaviors maintain many masculine stereotypes: (1) strong and brave; (2) competitive; (3) emotionally unexpressive; (4) problem solver; (5) isolated; (6) sexual, not sensual; (7) dynamic, decisive, and aggressive; (8) controlling; (9) tough and autonomous. These attributes of real men are desirable to some degree but when they are positioned as absolutes and are maintained by shaming and avoidance of shame then these behaviors become dysfunctional and destructive. The author argues for a removal of the limits on behavior and feeling and the re-incorporation of the so called non-male parts back into men's psyches.

In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‐ranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‐sex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is a very specific and complex period in a woman’s life. The accompanying changes are observed not only on the biological/physiological plane but also in her psychological and social functioning. Altered psychological functioning can occur from the very beginning to the end of pregnancy, including the postpartum period. During pregnancy, visible changes occur in the body's appearance, as well as in femininity, affections, and sexuality, whereas the woman's position and role are gaining new qualities. To a greater or lesser degree, every expectant mother experiences psychological am­bivalence, frequent mood changes from exhaustion to exaltation, emotional disturbances, and/or mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. In addition, pregnancy causes a number of specific apprehensions concerning the course and outcome, which makes the woman particularly vulnerable and requires adequate treatment, depending on the adaptive capacities of her personality. Furthermore, from a psychosocial aspect, pregnancy could be considered a specific highly emotional state, which may be a potent stressor. Perinatal maternal stress can lead to different complications that may have far-reaching consequences for both somatic and psychic functioning of the newborn. This review considers pregnancy as a complex psychological phenomenon and explores multiple changes in the woman's psychological functioning in both normal and psychologically complicated courses of pregnancy.",

L'idealtype professionnel est par ailleurs empreint de manieres de faire, dire et penser eminemment viriles et la domination masculine est tres presente. Les femmes qui investissent la specialite, veritables exceptions statistiques, doivent bien souvent s'accommoder de la violence verbale et/ou symbolique exercee par leurs collaborateurs hommes. Un patrimoine dispositionnel a dominante masculine - constitue bien souvent en amont de l'exercice professionnel - reste une excellente ressource pour faire face a ce contexte agonistique des rapports sociaux de sexe qui regne au bloc operatoire. Toutefois, a y regarder de plus pres, on s'apercoit que meme les femmes chirurgiens les plus masculines activent des dispositions feminines dans certains contextes, mettant alors en veille leurs dispositions masculines , dispositions qu'elles peuvent mettre en œuvre dans d'autres contextes et a d'autres moments de leur trajectoire. La pluralite dispositionnelle des enquetees apparait donc a la fois comme diachronique (elles mettent en œuvre des dispositions sexuees tantot masculines, tantot feminines selon les differentes etapes de leur parcours professionnel) et synchronique (a une meme etape de leur carriere elles mettent en œuvre des dispositions sexuees differentes selon les sollicitations des contextes et des interlocuteurs qu'elles rencontrent). On a montre notamment, a la suite de Joan Cassell (1998), que les femmes chirurgiens ne se comportaient pas de la meme facon selon qu'elles interagissaient avec les chirurgiens hommes ou avec les infirmieres. Par ailleurs, les trajectoires genrees des enquetees se caracterisent par une pente allant du masculin vers plus de feminin puisque, tendanciellement, les enquetees se masculinisent fortement au moment de la formation de l'internat et qu'elles vont vers des modalites de comportements plus feminines a mesure qu'elles font l'experience de la maternite et qu'elles avancent dans le metier, gagnant en autonomie par rapport aux collegues masculins.",

      "title": "Sexually dimorphic nonreproductive behaviors as indicators of endocrine disruption.",
      "abstract": "Measures of cognitive and other behaviors not specifically related to reproduction are often sex-linked. Males and females perform differently on many tasks and often interact with members of their species in dissimilar ways. If such differences are diminished, reversed, or widened by prenatal chemical exposures, a reasonable inference is that exposure interfered with sexual differentiation of the brain, largely, but not exclusively, through interference with the actions of gonadal hormones. Explicit recognition of sex differences in performance is not a prominent feature of toxicity testing, however, except for reproduction studies, and is not a recognized criterion in developmental neurotoxicity testing. In contrast to the low visibility accorded sex differences in testing protocols for the assessment of developmental neurotoxicity, the literature is filled with examples showing that the developing male and female respond differently to many chemical agents, with subsequent expression in behavior. Quite often, even when such differences are reported, further analyses are not carried out nor are subsequent studies conducted for clarification. Moreover, many investigators include only male subjects. Both polychlorinated biphenyls and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) studies provide several examples of striking differences between the behavioral responses of male and female offspring to developmental exposure. They offer examples, as well, of how to approach the study and analysis of such differences. Given the societal importance of risk assessments applied to potential developmental neurotoxicants, studies should be deemed questionable if they fail to include outcome measures based on sexual dimorphisms in nonreproductive behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Hormones are partial determinants of certain sexually dimorphic behaviors and interact with psychosocial, environmental, and other physiologic factors. The part played by sex hormones in the direct control of overt human behavior is, compared with that found in lower animals, slight and less readily definable. In humans, these hormones, although necessary for maintenance of libido and sexual behavior, seem to control the intensity of such behavior rather than its direction. In most women of reproductive age, the different phases of the menstrual cycle are not associated with major physical or psychologic discomfort. Some women actually report positive changes during the premenstrual period. Only 5-10% of women in this age group have changes in mood, sleep, eating habits, level of energy, and physical symptoms that appear to be linked temporally to the late-luteal phase of the cycle. It is plausible to assume that women with LLPDD are vulnerable to the menstrual cycle as a Zeitgeber. In these women, a cascade of events triggered originally along the HPG axis brings about the shift from an existing vulnerability to the actual manifestations of LLPDD and other forms of female-specific mood disorders. The degree of vulnerability becomes apparent at puberty when girls are exposed to increasing estrogenic influences. Particularly vulnerable times are the periods that mark shifts in the reproductive stages (menarche, the premenstruum, puerperium, and menopause), periods associated with major hormonal turmoil and psychosocial stresses. A conditioning-sensitization model has been described to explain the longitudinal course of affective disorders, and it also has been proposed for PMS. According to this model, even low levels of psychosocial stress are capable of triggering episodes of dysphoria in vulnerable previously sensitized subjects. LLPDD is associated strongly with a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, and the concurrent comorbidity in these women is also high. Future epidemiologic studies on depression should consider the effects of female-specific Zeitgeber on mood disorders in the populations studied.",

      "abstract": "Despite the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) more than 30 years ago, people with disabilities experience significant barriers to exercising their right to sexual and reproductive health throughout their life course. The historical segregation and stigmatization of disabled individuals has created the conditions in which members of this population experience persistent disparities in the prevalence of adverse health conditions and inadequate attention to care, along with disparities in preventive care, health promotion, and access to health care services. These disparities manifest in social services and health care generally and also in the sphere of sexual and reproductive health. Among many direct care workers, health care providers, and family members, assumptions persist that individuals with disabilities are asexual, unable to exercise informed consent to sexual activity, and unable to carry a pregnancy to term or to parent successfully. These assumptions adversely affect the ability of individuals with disabilities to access basic information about their sexual health and function in order to make informed decisions about their sexual activity, and also impact their access to preventive health screening, contraception, and perinatal care. Inadequate transportation and physically inaccessible environments and equipment such as examination tables pose additional barriers for some disabled individuals. A lack of training in disability-competent care among health care professionals is a pervasive problem and presents yet another challenge to obtaining appropriate and necessary information and care. Despite these barriers, the research shows that more and more women with disabilities are having children, and there is an increasing recognition that people with disabilities have a right to sexual expression and appropriate sexual and reproductive health care , accompanied by a gradual evolution among social services and health care providers to provide the necessary information and support.",

Deviants frequently look for unconventional sources of medical, legal, and psychiatric services, either because they cannot afford what is conventionally available or, as is often true with regard to medical services, because they do not like the embarrassment and harassment they experience from conventional practitioners.

More recently, however, there has been some speculation and emerging evidence suggesting that social anxiety and aggression may be related. The present study examined social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression within a late adolescent sample. Two forms of dating aggression were assessed: physical aggression, such as slapping, use of a weapon, or forced sexual activity, and psychological aggression, such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to one's partner. One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a significant predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality. Notably, FNE was most predictive of increased aggression of both types when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Despite its demonstrated importance as a contextual variable, however, relationship quality did not mediate the association between FNE and psychological or physical aggression. Implications for prevailing conceptualizations of social anxiety and dating aggression are discussed.",

      "title": "Toward Prevention of Childhood Sexual Abuse: Preschoolers’ Knowledge of Genital Body Parts",
      "abstract": "This study examined preschool children’s knowledge of their genital and non-genital body parts. Results indicated that almost all preschool children knew the correct terms for their non-genital body parts, but few knew the correct terminology for their genitals. The importance of this skill in preventing childhood sexual abuse is discussed. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a serious public health problem. Although definitions vary state by state and in various research programs, CSA is generally defined as sexual contact between a child (under the age of 18) with a person who is at least 5 years older. According to the American Psychological Association (2001), a central characteristic of any abuse is the dominant position of the adult that allows him or her to force or coerce the child into sexual activity. Child sexual abuse may include fondling a child's genitals, masturbation, oral-genital contact, digital penetration, and vaginal and anal intercourse. However, it is not solely restricted to physical contact; such abuse could include non-contact abuse, such as exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography. With close to 100,000 confirmed cases of CSA in the United States during 2005 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007), efforts to prevent CSA are needed. One public health approach to the prevention of CSA offers child-focused personal safety education programs, usually implemented in schools and preschools. The primary focus of most school-based personal safety programs is to strengthen a child’s ability to recognize and resist assault (primary prevention), although they often have a secondary prevention focus as well. The secondary prevention objective is to encourage victims to disclose abuse and to improve adults’ responses to these disclosures so that children can receive early intervention and protection to reduce the negative consequences of sexual exploitation (Wurtele, 1998). Successful disclosure of abusive incidents relies partly on the child’s ability to describe inappropriate activities involving the genitals and to correctly label the genitals. When children disclose CSA using incorrect or idiosyncratic terminology (e.g., “She touched my monkey,” or “He kissed my muffin”), they may not be understood and are thus unlikely to receive a positive, supportive response to their disclosure. In contrast, disclosure using correct terminology is more likely to be understood, resulting in a more positive outcome for a child—e.g., by ending the abusive situation and obtaining therapeutic assistance for the child (Kenny, Thakkar-Kolen, Ryan, Runyon, & Capri, 2008). Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and sexuality (Elliot, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75 children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer & Vaughan, 2000). Along with facilitating disclosure, teaching proper names for all body parts helps children develop a healthy, positive body image (Wurtele, 1993; Wurtele, Melzer, & Kast, 1992). As Honig (2000) states, it gives children “naming power” (p. 17) just as they have the power to",

This raises questions of how to define and investigate conduct problems in females as well as how to identify differential childhood antecedents. A developmental psychopathology perspective is advanced as one useful approach to understanding adaptive and maladaptive social patterns in males and females that may lead to different developmental trajectories and influence the forms of psychopathology that develop. The utility of de-emphasizing serious physical aggression as one important criteria for conduct problems is questioned. Recommendations that particular forms of deviance in females be considered as markers of their antisocial patterns (e.g., somatic complaints, friendlessness, underachievement) are also called into question. Rather than adopt sex-specific criteria to assess conduct problems, it is necessary to expand and broaden the diagnostic categories to include serious externalizing problems regardless of whether they occur in males or females.",

Offender(s) may deny homosexuality and confuse an aggressive active behaviour with a masculine (even macho) behaviour. They may project their homosexual feelings onto the victim. In the aftermath of rape, the victim may be ashamed of having lost control and may question himself about his real sexual identity. An aspect of female or male rape by a group of males may be an attempt to annihilate latent homosexual tendencies existing between members of this group. Surprisingly, in the short term, post traumatic disorder related to rape and pre-existing psychiatric disorder may develop separately, without substantial interaction. In the famous case of Schreiber described by Freud, homosexuality is assumed to play an important role in the development of paranoid schizophrenia. Cases in which schizophrenic patients (of both sexes) imagine being raped by a member of the opposite sex, may possibly challenge this opinion.",

Women tend to have higher rates of internalizing disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety), while men experience more externalizing symptoms (i.e., violence, substance abuse). These patterns are often attributed to gender differences in socialization (including the acquisition of expectations associated with traditional gender roles), help seeking, coping, and socioeconomic status. However, measurement bias (inadequate survey assessment of men’s experiences) and clinician bias (practitioner’s subconscious tendency to overlook male distress) may lead to underestimates of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among men. Continuing to focus on gender differences in mental health may obscure significant within-gender group differences in men’s symptomatology.

      "title": "[Psychiatric complications of abortion].",
      "abstract": "The psychiatric consequences of induced abortion continue to be the object of controversy. The reactions of women when they became aware of conception are very variable. Pregnancy, whether initially intended or unintended, may provoke stress; and miscarriage may bring about feelings of loss and grief reaction. Therefore, induced abortion, with its emotional implications (of relief, shame and guilt) not surprisingly is a stressful adverse life event. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: There is agreement among researchers on the need to compare the mental health outcomes (or the psychiatric complications) with appropriate groups, including women with unintended pregnancies ending in live births and women with miscarriages. There is also agreement on the need to control for the potential confounding effects of multiple variables: demographic, contextual, personal development, previous or current traumatic experiences, and mental health prior to the obstetric event. Any psychiatric outcome is multi-factorial in origin and the impact of life events depend on how they are perceived, the psychological defence mechanisms (unconscious to a great extent) and the coping style. The fact of voluntarily aborting has an undeniable ethical dimension in which facts and values are interwoven.No research study has found that induced abortion is associated with a better mental health outcome, although the results of some studies are interpreted as <<neutral>> or <<mixed.>> Some general population studies point out significant associations with alcohol or illegal drug dependence, mood disorders (including depression) and some anxiety disorders. Some of these associations have been confirmed, and nuanced, by longitudinal prospective studies which support causal relationships.With the available data, it is advisable to devote efforts to the mental health care of women who have had an induced abortion. Reasons of the woman's mental health by no means can be invoked, on empirical bases, for inducing an abortion.",

Even now, after the rejection of many of these theories, making way for new scientific explanations and understandings, there remain many differences in the manner in which health facilities are handed out to women when compared to men. Especially when it comes to reproductive health, depictions in literature, as well as other cultural productions, have often either glossed over these matters or have presented them in an intentionally euphemistic manner, albeit in the guise of decency. The reality of the difficulties of women’s reproductive illnesses (self-perception) complicated both by birth control fertility treatments as well as the pregnancy in itself that often bring several complications in a woman’s body are usually never considered sickness (societal recognition) or disease (recognition by medical practitioners). In using the terms illness, sickness and disease, the paper is carrying forward the accepted critical difference between the three first articulated by A. Twaddle (1964) Through the study of Lucy Knisley’s refreshingly frank graphic memoir Kid Gloves: Nine Months of Careful Chaos, this paper aims to question the process of normalisation that turns many of women’s illnesses suffered during pregnancy or in the process of birth control as ‘side-effects’ and unrecognised, how they become impossible to cure, in the first place. The paper will show how the text not only uncovers the mystification surrounding women’s health in general, revealing the patriarchal attitudes that inform such notions, but does so in a simple manner that is also fun to read- making it a compelling feminist text.",

      "title": "Female Sexual Response",
      "abstract": "In Brief A large component of women's sexual desire is responsive rather than spontaneous. Therefore, women's motivation and ability to find and respond to sexual stimuli to experience sexual arousal and subsequent sexual desire is crucial, but complex. In ongoing relationships, a woman's motivation appears to be largely influenced by her emotional intimacy with her partner and her wish to enhance it. Drugs (including androgen replacement therapy) aimed at increasing women's spontaneous sexual wanting (less characteristic of women in long-term relationships) or their arousability may have a role if other psychologic factors affecting arousability are addressed in tandem. A woman's sexual arousal is composite and complex, correlating well with how mentally exciting she finds the sexual stimulus and its context and poorly with objective genital blood flow changes. Drugs aimed at increasing the latter, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may have a role if there is prior careful enquiry as to whether genital engorgement is present but not attended to or is physically absent. Psycho-physiologic studies to date suggest the former is common in women presenting with arousal disorder. Defining the components of desire and arousal lacking in women with sexual dysfunction is necessary to establish benefit from pharmacologic intervention.",

      "abstract": "The problem of measuring meaning continues to present conceptual and methodological difficulty in research. In most cases, attitudinal or connotative meanings are elicited from social objects particularly role sets, cultural groups or specialized aggregates. But in some cases, the scaling of a denotative object like a role set would have desirable advantages. For the mentally ill-healthy role set, this could mean avoiding stereotypic responses provided the scales were sufficiently projective. To exploit this possibility, a differential scale representing the ill-healthy roles was tested under various conditions of control. The findings suggest that the ill-healthy items adequately scale and distinguish between the concept criteria. A further theoretical implication was tested, showing that the mentally ill-healthy roles were not significantly different when compared to the evaluational dimension of the semantic differential implying that legitimacy (tendency to sanction) is the central focus of meaning for this dyadic structure.",

Sexual jealousy is of particular interest to the psychiatrist, since in its morbid manifestations it destroys marital harmony (Gillard, 1896) and may lead to homicide or suicide (Mowat, 1966). Sexual jealousy may be regarded as a normal reaction but it is abnormal when: (a) the jealous person is haunted by what the ‘man in the street’ would recognize as a groundless conviction that his or her sexual partner has been, or will be, unfaithful; or (b) jealousy engendered by actual infidelity is of such intensity as to render the person dangerously aggressive. Examples of the second category are Ruth Ellis, who shot dead her unfaithful lover; and Pilar Garcia-Compte, who killed her husband after he had refused to break with his mistress.",

      "title": "The Seduction Script: Psychological and Cultural Norms of Interpersonal Approaches As Markers for Sexual Aggression and Abuse",
      "abstract": "Hardly any subjects enjoy greater – public or private – interest than the art of flirtation and seduction. However, interpersonal approach behavior not only paves the way for sexual interaction and reproduction, but it simultaneously integrates non-sexual psychobiological and cultural standards regarding consensus and social norms. In the present paper, we use script theory as a concept that extends across psychological and cultural science to assess behavioral options during interpersonal approaches. Specifically, we argue that approaches follow scripted event sequences that entail ambivalence as an essential communicative element. On the one hand, ambivalence may facilitate interpersonal approaches by maintaining and provoking situational uncertainty, so that the outcome of an action – even after several approaches and dates – remains ambiguous. On the other hand, ambivalence may increase the risk for sexual aggression or abuse, depending on the individual's abilities, the circumstances, and the intentions of the interacting partners. Recognizing latent sequences of sexually aggressive behavior, in terms of their rigid structure and behavioral options, may thus enable individuals to use resources efficiently, avoid danger, and extricate themselves from assault situations. We conclude that interdisciplinary script knowledge about ambivalence as a core component of the seduction script may be helpful for counteracting subtly aggressive intentions and preventing sexual abuse. We discuss this with regard to the nature-nurture debate as well as phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of interpersonal approach behavior and its medial implementation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorders of sex development (DSD) are relatively rare conditions with diverse pathophysiology, which usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. These conditions are very heterogeneous and can present in a variety of different ways, most commonly with ambiguous genitalia noticed in the newborn period or delayed puberty in adolescents. The impact of these disorders on the lives of these patients and their families should not be underestimated. These clinical situations can often be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where the sex of rearing is uncertain. The needs of each individual patient presenting with DSD conditions must be fully considered, along with the needs of their families and where appropriate, cultural practices. The multidisciplinary team should be involved from early in the diagnosis and ethical principles must be considered at all stages of management of the condition. Key Concepts: Disorders of sex development usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. There are three broad groups of DSD: sex chromosome DSD; 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD. Where there is uncertainty about the sex of a patient, sex assignment should be delayed until appropriate investigations have been carried out. A multidisciplinary team should be involved from an early stage. The psychosocial implications of a diagnosis of DSD must be considered for the family and the patient.",

      "title": "Verso una tassonomia più efficace delle condizioni diagnosticate come matrimonio non consumato",
      "abstract": "La definizione piu condivisa di non consumato o bianco (MB) fa riferimento al fallimento nel realizzare un rapporto sessuale penetrativo all’inizio del matrimonio. Il MB di solito si verifica nelle prime notti del e frequentemente viene chiamato honey moon impotence (impotenza in luna di miele) o wedding night impotence (impotenza della notte di nozze). Tuttavia, sebbene il fenomeno sia presente ovunque, nelle diverse aree geografiche del mondo la sessualita segue modelli molto diversi circa le regole che la riguardano e il significato che le viene attribuito. Inoltre, l’evoluzione e la globalizzazione della societa ha creato nuovi contesti e nuovi tipi di relazioni, libe-rando i legami dalle forme rigide e precostituite che fino alla meta del secolo scorso rappresentavano una costante sociale. Tali trasformazioni, in continuo sviluppo, potrebbero quindi ostacolare la corretta classificazione di queste disfunzioni sessuali, in cui le variabili sociali risultano cruciali. Obiettivo: analizzare la letteratura scientifica sul MB, per capire se le diagnosi eseguite nelle diverse societa si riferiscono alle stesse condizioni. Metodo: e stata condotta una revisione della letteratura pubblicata sul MB dal 1970 ad oggi attraverso i principali database scientifici, Pubmed Psycharticle e Psychinfo. Risultati: differenze sostanziali sono emerse fra le societa medio orientali e le societa occidentali. In primo luogo, nelle societa medio orientali la sessualita e ammissibile solo nel matrimonio, mentre nelle societa occidentali la sessualita e le relazioni non sono fortemente legate. Cio potrebbe suggerire che il termine matrimonio non sia adeguato a descrivere tale fenomeno nelle diverse aree geografiche del mondo. Inoltre, il tempo medio prima della consultazione, l’attribuzione causale e la prevalenza sono molto diverse nei paesi occidentali e mediorientali. Conclusioni: abbiamo trovato che il termine nei primi tentativi di coito sarebbe piu adatto a descrivere le difficolta maschili, femminili o di entrambi legate all’ignoranza sulla sessualita e all’ansia da prestazione. Mentre, oltre la categorizzazione delle disfunzioni sessuali individuali, suggeriamo il termine Relazione non consumata nei casi in cui pregresse difficolta individuali verso la sessualita, sono coinvolte nella creazione di una disfunzione sessuale di coppia.",

      "title": "VIOLENCIA: UNA REVISIÓN DEL TEMA DENTRO DEL MARCO DE TRABAJO DE INVESTIGACIÓN EN EL INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE PSIQUIATRÍA*",
      "abstract": "Hasta hace relativamente poco no se le daba importancia plena a las diversas manifestaciones de la violencia, pero en la actualidad cada vez son mas los trabajos de investigacion que se realizan para conocer este problema en sus diversas areas. La violencia es un fenomeno extenso que se manifiesta tanto en el ambito interpersonal e individual como social. En consecuencia, como concepto es igualmente amplio, multisemantico, ya que senala distintos atributos que hacen enfasis segun el campo especifico del que se habla. El fenomeno esta imbricado lo mismo en la guerra que en el crimen organizado y la delincuencia comun. En ocasiones se da en las instituciones del Estado, pero tambien se manifiesta en la familia, ya sea entre los conyuges o la pareja, hacia los hijos o cualquier otro integrante de esta. Existe violencia con implicaciones particulares como la violencia sexual hacia los ninos, el incesto y la violacion, asi como violencia autoinfligida, como el suicidio. Para los profesionales de la salud mental, cada forma en que se manifiesta la violencia tiene implicaciones particulares en terminos de los efectos, ya sean en la salud fisica, la salud mental o en los aspectos psicosociales. En este sentido es importante obtener conocimiento sobre el tema, ya que muchas de estas areas no han recibido la atencion que merecen. Dado lo anterior, el interes del presente trabajo ha sido organizar y sintetizar la informacion de las diversas investigaciones llevadas a cabo en el Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria sobre el tema de violencia, con el fin de ofrecer una panoramica que nos permita ubicar las principales areas y como se han trabajado, asi como discutir hacia donde seria conveniente continuar los esfuerzos. Durante la vida academica de nuestra institucion de salud se han llevado a cabo diversos proyectos de investigacion vinculados con la problematica de la violencia. Por un lado, estan los trabajos que asocian el consumo de alcohol y violencias como los accidentes de transito, los delitos, los ingresos a salas de urgencia y la violencia en la familia, entre otros. Por otro, se encuentran los trabajos que asocian el consumo de drogas con alguna forma de violencia, particularmente las muertes violentas como los accidentes, la violencia delictiva y la familiar. El mayor numero de trabajos se concentra en el area de la salud mental, ya que esta incluye una amplia variedad de temas como la conducta suicida -que incluye ideacion, intento y suicidio consumado-, ademas de trastornos asociados, intimamente ligados con hechos de violencia, como el estres postraumatico. Asimismo se han abordado gran variedad de aspectos psicologicos y psicosociales, como la violencia de genero. A pesar de lo anterior, aun hace falta mayor investigacion en areas especificas como los efectos del secuestro, la tortura y el abuso sexual, asi como investigacion centrada en los perpetradores. El resultado de la investigacion es fundamental ya que, previo a la intervencion, es necesario conocer las diversas implicaciones en la salud mental; por ejemplo, que trastornos se asocian y por que a las distintas violencias, y que otras consecuencias pueden surgir. Precisamente, todo el conocimiento generado es de gran ayuda para una intervencion oportuna en las victimas. Pero tambien se puede incidir en un ambito mas amplio; por ejemplo, utilizando la informacion obtenida para influir en las instituciones, tanto legales como educativas, asi como considerar la posible influencia de los medios masivos de comunicacion. Esto podria tener una repercusion positiva en el nivel social, ya que el fenomeno de la violencia comprende por igual a las victimas y a los perpetradores. Ambos grupos han recibido una influencia cultural y social que hay que conocer para hacer lo posible por contrarrestarla.",

Women react to certain facts of life in their biography with different internal reality, which amalgamates both the physical, psychic, and social reality. The individual culture, naturally, also plays an essential role in the process. The influence of actual physical experience can be to instigate significant changes in the internal world. Many mothers who experience this separation from their daughters and see their attention to a man as mischief, are seemingly angry, feel robbed, and like Demeter demand \"temples\" for themselves, desirous of reverence and obedience.",

It might be said that the linguistic offensive act of bursting out occurs when people are ignored or some desires collapsed.\nA human being has personality and morality as the lord of all creatures, and therefore if they reveal their animal instinct to others or break the moral standards, they would be condemned. The rate of this phenomenon appears remarkably in the countries based on Confucian culture.\nThe ratio of abusive language related to sex and animals shows very highly in Korea and China. Both countries have a similar cultural background, specifically that of Confucian culture. Therefore, they have very similar moral sense and ethical consciousness. The abusive language through an insult or debasement of someone or something directly referring undesirable appearance, moral imperfection, low social position, physical or mental disability, undesirable family line, excrement and excretion and immoral sexual relationship has many similarities in countries with Confucian culture. The ones related to animals and punishment have many differences relatively because of the differences of metaphorical expressions and the means for punishment. Accordingly they have differences in the midst of similarities.\nThere are remarkable differences in not only the content but the frequency in both countries’ abusive language culture. Chinese abusive language related to physical and mental disabilities and a talkative behavior among behaviors show very high frequency. Also, the rate of abusive language related to the extinction of one’s family line among ones related to the preservation of lineage appears highly. On the contrary, in Korean abusive language, the ones related to disease, death, excrement and excretion appear frequently. Hence Korean ones have more abstraction compared with Chinese ones. In indirect abusive language, there is the difference in content and frequency. In ones related to a punishment, there is difference in the content. The rate of frequency of what is higher in Korea. In ones related to animals, “rabbit, turtle and pig” are used in the ones related to sex and “cow, bear, pig and donkey” are used in ones related to intelligent ability in China. This is the typical tendency in Chinese abusive language. Also, a high frequency of them appear. The culture of abusive language has many differences in indirect expressions especially between Korean and Chinese ones, even though they have many similarities. Therefore, as mentioned before, it could be concluded that between Chinese abusive language and Korean ones many differences and similarities show at the same time.",

Por ello, el estudio presente se centra en delimitar con precision el concepto de “atraccion sexual”, que es distinto al carino, a la admiracion, a la mal llamada “atraccion romantica” y a la excitacion sexual. Por otra parte, en el asexual se observan frecuentes conductas masturbatorias y parafilicas, y es obvio que estas conductas responden a otros factores no dependientes de la “atraccion erotica”, lo que conduce a mantener como evidencia la existencia de tres factores fundamentales constituyentes del nucleo de la sexualidad humana: atraccion sexual, excitacion y orgasmo.

The present study (1) demonstrated that the preferential rape pattern co‐occurs with the above reasonably well established expressions of courtship disorder to a higher degree than other main paraphilic activity patterns do and (2) supported the conjecture that in addition to an erotic preference for unfamiliarity of target person‐or‐object (noted by earlier authors), three other paraphilic target‐person or object preferences may be connected with courtship disorder, though they are not at all virtually obligatory as is erotic unfamiliarity. These are choosing children and adults alike as target persons of the paraphilic activities, non‐gender dysphoric transvestism, and fetishism.",

      "title": "American Constitutions and Artificial Insemination Births",
      "abstract": "Childbirth can arise from sex. Increasingly, it also arises from assisted reproduction which usually involves either “the introduction of semen . . . into a woman’s vagina, cervical canal or uterus through . . . artificial means,” the process of artificial insemination (AI), or the introduction of a fertilized egg into a woman “using gametes” that are not the woman’s “own,” the process of fertilized egg introduction (FEI).State laws generally govern childcare parentage in the United States for children born of sex, AI, or FEI, though there are some federal guidelines. The balance in state lawmaking on childcare parentage between legislatures and courts for any particular form of birth varies interstate. The balance within a single state also often varies depending on the form of birth, including children born of sex, of nonsurrogacy AI, of nonsurrogacy FEI, of surrogacy AI (i.e., a genetic surrogate), or of surrogacy FEI (i.e., a gestational surrogate). State childcare parentage laws for children born of sex have changed in the last half century through recognitions of voluntary acknowledgment, residency/hold out, and de facto parent doctrines. State laws on children born of surrogacy pacts involving FEI have also evolved. Enforceable FEI surrogacy pacts provide an avenue to parenthood for some while recognizing a waiver of childcare interests by others; here, statutory guidelines usually require medical aid, and perhaps judicial oversight. At least for now, there are no do-it-yourselfers (DIY) undertaking FEI births. Pregnancy cannot be accomplished by following a YouTube video. State laws on children born of nonsurrogacy and surrogacy AI have also evolved. As with surrogacy FEI births, these laws often speak of medical oversight. But there can be, and have been, many DIY AI pregnancies. Thank you YouTube. To date, there is no comprehensive constitutional, statutory, or common law guidance on childcare parentage arising from AI births involving DIYers. Childcare parentage issues arising from AI births are subject to constitutional guidance, including Due Process, Equal Protection and Privacy dictates. Constitutional rights, however, sometimes go unrecognized in AI laws, particularly for same sex couples, wed or unwed, as well as for single women. Upon a brief review of contemporary American state AI laws, current and future constitutional precedents are explored. Constitutional, as well as public policy, reforms are particularly needed for same sex female couples and for single women employing DIY AI to become parents.",

      "title": "Things rank and gross in nature: A review and synthesis of moral disgust.",
      "abstract": "Much like unpalatable foods, filthy restrooms, and bloody wounds, moral transgressions are often described as \"disgusting.\" This linguistic similarity suggests that there is a link between moral disgust and more rudimentary forms of disgust associated with toxicity and disease. Critics have argued, however, that such references are purely metaphorical, or that moral disgust may be limited to transgressions that remind us of more basic disgust stimuli. Here we review the evidence that moral transgressions do genuinely evoke disgust, even when they do not reference physical disgust stimuli such as unusual sexual behaviors or the violation of purity norms. Moral transgressions presented verbally or visually and those presented as social transactions reliably elicit disgust, as assessed by implicit measures, explicit self-report, and facial behavior. Evoking physical disgust experimentally renders moral judgments more severe, and physical cleansing renders them more permissive or more stringent, depending on the object of the cleansing. Last, individual differences in the tendency to experience disgust toward physical stimuli are associated with variation in moral judgments and morally relevant sociopolitical attitudes. Taken together, these findings converge to support the conclusion that moral transgressions can in fact elicit disgust, suggesting that moral cognition may draw upon a primitive rejection response. We highlight a number of outstanding issues and conclude by describing 3 models of moral disgust, each of which aims to provide an account of the relationship between moral and physical disgust.",

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.",

Yet there is probably no other major sphere of man's dailylife so poorly understood and so infrequently and ineptly studied as his sexual behavior. Some of the sexual taboos typical of our culture have been relaxed appreciably during the past two or three decades; but social convention still raises discouraging barriers to the experimental investigation of human sexuality. It is to be earnestly hoped that direct, intensive study of the physiological and psychological bases for sexual arousal and the resultant overt behavior in human beings will become possible in the near future. Investigations of this character have been conducted with animals other than man, and no physician need be reminded of the great body of currently useful medical knowledge which was originally derived from experimentation with animals. Many recent studies of sexual behavior in lower mammals have yielded data which appear to have a direct bearing upon the understanding of human sexual reactions.",

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: Rosanabila95@gmail.com Abstract KUHP tidak ada pengaturan perbuatan persetubuhan, namun ada kemiripan secara menyeluruh terkait pengaturan yang ada. Karena dalam pasal 292 masih terdapat batas usia untuk korban maupun tersangka dan tidak menyebutkan adanya perbuatan persetubuhan melainkan perbuatan cabul yang dilakukan sesama kelamin. Sedangkan dalam pengaturan lain, dalam Undang-Undang Qanun Jinayah Aceh No. 6 Tahun 2014 disebutkan dalam istilah Islam, yaitu istilah lain untuk homoseksual secara yuridis. Selain itu Qanun Aceh juga memiliki kesamaan dalam peraturan yang terdapat di Luar Negeri yaitu di Malaysia. Namun persetubuhan yang dilakukan oleh homoseksual yaitu dengan cara seks oral atau seks anal. Karena pasangan homoseksual hanya memperoleh kenikmatan saja dan tidak dapat menghasilkan keturunan. Atau yang berhubungan dengan badan seseorang misalnya : meraba-raba atau mencium-cium organ tubuh manusia. Kata Kunci: Kriminalisasi, tindak pidana, persetubuhan sesama jenis Abstract The Criminal Code does not regulate intercourse, but there is a general resemblance to the existing arrangements. Because in article 292 there is still an age limit for the victim and the suspect and does not mention the existence of the act of intercourse but the lewd acts committed by fellow sex. Whereas in other arrangements, in Aceh's Qanun Jinayah Law No. 6 Year 2014 is mentioned in Islamic terms, another term for homosexual juridically. In addition, the Aceh Qanun also has similarities in the regulations contained abroad namely in Malaysia. But copulation done by homosexual is by way of oral sex or anal sex. Because homosexual couples get only pleasure and cannot produce offspring. Or related to a person's body for example: groping or kissing human organs.

The present study aimed to investigate effects of sexual orientation on premature and delayed ejaculation.

Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

Rape is a one of violence that is not distinguish with gender, age, socio-economic status, place and time. It also does not matter what clothing or makeup is worn at the time, in sick or healthy condition. The suffer from rape victims has been experienced since the occurrence of rape. Suffering includes social burdens in society, fears of pregnancy and the onset of illness or infection, and others. As a result of rape causes physical and psychological damage to rape victims. Psychological losses can affect the daily life of rape victims as a psychological impact. Psychological effects on rape victims appear with symptoms that appropriate to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including sadness, depressed mood, insomnia, loss of interest in usual activities, negative self-concept, self-blame, feeling useless and guilty, difficult to concentrate, often think about suicide or death. Compensation for rape victims needs to be obtained by considering the psychological condition. There has not yet been any compensation for the psychological impact on rape victims. About compensation has been regulated in Law No. 31/2014 Regarding Amendment to Law No. 13/2006 concerning Protection of Witnesses and Victims. the regulation does not include compensation for psychological effects. In this regard, it is necessary to address the urgency of regulating compensation for psychological effects on rape victims.",

Vasomotor symptoms were reported less consistently in different cultures. Depression, sexual dysfunction and sleep disturbances were not commonly described across cultures. It is obvious that biological and sociocultural factors interact during the menopausal transition in the individual woman and modulate her experience of symptoms. In any culture-sensitive care for menopausal women, physicians should be open and aware of three major culturally determined concepts: the body in health and disease, age and aging, and menstruation and cessation of menstruation. Especially the concept about the body in health and disease with beliefs about the optimal shape and size of the body, including clothing and decoration of the surface, beliefs about the boundaries of the body, about the body's inner structure and about how the body functions are very important to understand and to integrate this understanding. For practical purposes, health professionals should: assess the woman's individual experience of physical and psychological changes; encourage the narrative of symptoms to understand the individual priorities, subjective underpinnings and interpretations; listen to her beliefs about her body in health and disease and give a respectful feed back about your understanding of the patients' concepts; introduce the biomedical model as one possible model of understanding the changes experiences; try to find similarities between the patients' concepts and the biomedical model; try to bring together biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to the symptoms; offer different treatment options from different concepts, and encourage shared decision-making about the individual treatment in which the physician's role is to give information which is then evaluated by the patient according to her values and priorities.",

Саме через це такі особи взагалі не наділяються правом на статеву свободу. Сувора та прагматична заборона на статеві зносини спирається на потребу забезпечення біологічного виживання популяції, виду.

Both the players' and characters' consent to observe/participate in sexual content should be respected with options to skip scenes or clear signals about what is about to happen. Also, while most games tend to feature consensual sex, they do not always model explicit communication or enthusiastic consent; this is partly due to the cultural stereotype that consent involves plaintive questioning (\"may I do X?\") as opposed to more erotic or collaborative models. Enthusiastic consent (i.e., not just \"okay\" but \"HELL YES!\") should be explored through verbal and nonverbal communication, with scope for branching choices about what characters want to do, or alternatives they suggest instead. Reluctant consent, where the character participates only due to present circumstances rather than interest, should be avoided unless the whole point of the games is to explore such events; in which case, this intent should be clearly signaled. The workshop questions invite players to analyze consent in existing games and model consent in their further works.",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

John Gagnon has argued for the past twenty years that gender training and experiences during development result in fundamental gender differences in adult sexual scripts and responses. Men's experiences in adolescence with genital arousal and orgasm, in conjunction with homosocial competitiveness and identification, create expectations and conditioning that bias men toward a goal-oriented, genital, self-focused sexual style. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) sexual dysfunction classification is laid out in a scrupulously gender-equal way.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundModulation of sexual desires is, in some cases, necessary to avoid inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior (downregulation of sexual desire) or to engage with a romantic partner (upregulation of sexual desire). Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual 'addiction'. This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control, high-frequency sexual behavior, consequences due to those behaviors, and poor ability to reduce those behaviors. However, such symptoms also may be better understood as a non-pathological variation of high sexual desire. Hypersexuals are thought to be relatively sexual reward sensitized, but also to have high exposure to visual sexual stimuli. Thus, the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear. If these individuals exhibit habituation, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished; if they merely have high sexual desire, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased. Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms.MethodsFifty-two (13 female) individuals who self-identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional (pleasant sexual, pleasant-non-sexual, neutral, and unpleasant) photographs while electroencephalography was collected.ResultsLarger P300 amplitude differences to pleasant sexual stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, was negatively related to measures of sexual desire, but not related to measures of hypersexuality.ConclusionImplications for understanding hypersexuality as high desire, rather than disordered, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The onset and development of preschoolers' awareness of sex role stereotypes, gender labeling, gender identity, and sex-typed toy preference were explored in 26-, 31-, and 36-month-old children. Gender labeling, gender identity, sex-typed toy preferences, and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in significantly more 26-month-old children than would have been expected by chance. Verbal gender labeling was observed in a majority of 26-month-olds, while verbal and nonverbal gender identity were observed in a majority of 31-month-olds. Nonverbal gender labeling and awareness of adult sex role differences were observed in a majority of children by 36 months. No evidence of awareness of sex differences in children's toys was found in the majority of children at any age. Awareness of sex role differences in children's toys was not related to awareness of adult sex role differences. Brighter children were more aware of adult sex role differences. Sex-typed toy preference was not related to awareness of sex role differences but was related to gender identity. Predictors of sex role development included the mothers' employment, and the father's personality traits, attitudes toward women, and sex-typed activities in the home. Implications for theories of early sex role development are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Comparing surveys from successive periods demonstrates that elderly people now enjoy a better and more varied sexual life than previous generations. The proportion of older people who remain sexually active has significantly increased, and the practices of masturbation or oral sex have spread considerably. The generation effect has an incidence upon sexual behaviour : older people’s repertoire of sexual practices differs from that of younger people, in the sense that it focuses less on sexual intercourse and oral sex. Women and men, beyond the common trends towards sexuality characterised by a more open repertoire of sexual practices, differ in terms of sexual interest and subjective sexual wellbeing. The cessation of sexual activity by individuals who had previously been sexually active is often the result of a cascade of reactions, such as the occurrence of a sexual dysfunction in one or both partners, anticipation of failure, increased anxiety, lack of adaptation of sexuality and/or avoidance behaviour.",

      "title": "The brain at play: neural substrates of social play behaviour in adolescent rats",
      "abstract": "The period between weaning and sexual maturity (i.e. childhood and adolescence in humans, roughly equivalent to the juvenile and adolescent stages in rodents) has received widespread attention because of its importance for behavioural development, and conversely, because of the emergence of certain psychiatric disorders during this period. During adolescence, substantial changes occur in brain and behaviour. In particular, there are profound changes in social behaviour, including increased complexity of the social repertoire and a remarkable increase in peer-peer interactions. For a large part, these peer-peer interactions take the form of social play behaviour. Social play behaviour is one of the earliest forms of non-mother directed social behaviour in mammals, although it can also be observed in other species, e.g. reptiles, invertebrates, and avian species. Social play behaviour during adolescence is thought to be important for proper social and cognitive development. Indeed, abnormalities in play behaviour have been observed in childhood psychiatric disorders such as autism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In addition, childhood social trauma may have long-lasting repercussions, that last well into adulthood. Therefore, in view of its importance for behavioural development, and its relevance for child and adolescent psychiatry, it is essential to identify the neural substrates underlying social play behaviour, which was the aim of this thesis. Several neuronal networks and neurotransmitters systems were investigated. This thesis indicates that the neuronal networks and neurotransmitters involved include those important for cognition, emotion, and motivation. Together with previous studies, the results from this thesis serve as to further delineate a potential ‘play’ network in the rat brain. This ‘play’ network plausibly consists of several cortical and subcortical systems that work together to establish the appropriate behavioural components of social play behaviour. Key regions in this network are the prefrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, habenula, VTA, and amygdala, as well as the monoamine neurotransmitter systems. As a result, this ‘play’ network establishes the proper behavioural acts in response to social and environmental cues to ensure that the appropriate behaviour is expressed considering the temporal and contextual setting, i.e. proper expression of social play behaviour. Therefore, the studies described in this thesis provide new clues considering the neural underpinnings of social play behaviour.",

Sexual dysfunction can be defined as a change in any component of sexual activity, which may cause frustration, pain and decreased sexual intercourse. Although it is known that chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), influence the quality of sexual life, sexual dysfunction is still underdiagnosed, due to two reasons: both patients fail to report the complaint because of shame or frustration, and this subject is rarely called into question by doctors. Rheumatologists are increasingly willing to discuss areas which are not directly related to drug treatment of joint diseases, such as quality of life, fatigue, and education of patients; however, sexuality is rarely addressed. The aim of this review is to present some useful concepts to Rheumatologists for orientation of their patients with RA with respect to sexual function/dysfunction, some considerations concerning the role of these professionals in order to instruct the patient, general notions about sexual function, including practical concepts about the more appropriate sexual positions for patients with RA, and a multidisciplinary approach to sexual dysfunction.",

      "title": "The Experience of “Bottoming”: Considerations for Identity and Learning",
      "abstract": "Bottoms—Gay men who prefer to be penetrated, sexually—are more stigmatized than other gay men, and may develop and experience identities differently than other gay, bisexual, or heterosexual men. This paper explores intrinsic dispositions and extrinsic motivations that may lead bottoms to perform and embody psychosocial and sexual identities in intimate, interpersonal, and social contexts. Sexuality is one of the most complicated, yet understudied aspects of human behavior. Despite sexuality being “the source of our most profound private emotional and physical experiences,” (Edwards & Brooks, 1999, p. 49) the subject “has remained un-discussable in everyday life” (p. 55) and as an area of interest and investigation. In contexts where dialogue about sexuality is considered appropriate, a number of dynamics tend to shape discussion, such as power, vulnerability, control, dominance, submission, and intimacy (Kippax & Smith, 2001). Many of these dynamics are the same or similar to those dynamics dictating the development of individuals’ identities, both sexual and non-sexual. However, conversations about sexuality rarely move beyond our most basic understandings of orientations (such as heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual) or temperaments (such as conservative/traditional or progressive/nontraditional). The diverse sexualities of gay men remain underexplored. Gay men may exhibit many different sexual role preferences that are as much a part of their identities as being gay itself (Hoppe, 2011). For example, some gay men identify as tops (generally prefer to penetrate during anal and/or oral intercourse), some identify as bottoms (generally prefer to be penetrated), some identify as versatile (generally exhibit no particular preference for penetrating/being penetrated), and some do not subscribe to any of these labels. The complexity of the meanings and connotations of penetration among gay men “is muddled by stereotypes, preconceived notions, exaggerated scenarios...and the inadequacy of the language we use to address [the] issue” (Underwood, 2003, pp. 13-14). However, this does not negate the need to continue to study the significance and consequence of the labels gay men use and to which they subscribe. Thinking about bottomhood as an identity is a particularly compelling place to begin because of the stigmatization often experienced by these gay men, both within and outside of communities of other gay men (Hoppe, 2011). Men and women of all sexual orientations still believe men compromise their masculinity when they allow penetration. Thus, “bottoms are judged on an entirely separate scale” and are often “more severely stigmatized because” penetration “is considered feminizing and shameful” (Underwood, 2003, p. 3). Men who identify as bottoms and allow penetration by other men, may be likely to develop and experience their identities differently than other gay men and certainly heterosexual or bisexual men. The purpose of this paper is to explore the intrinsic dispositions and extrinsic motivations that may lead some gay men to perform and embody “bottom identities” in intimate, interpersonal, and social contexts. The Scripting of Gay Bottom Identities Sexual scripting (Simon & Gagnon, 1973) considers sexuality “as a social process rather than a biological imperative” (Irvine, 2003, p. 490). Sexual scripting involves the embodiment and perpetuation, often unconscious, of codes that have become the baseline for human behavior",

      "title": "Sex‐obsessed or just sociable? Non‐copulatory displays in the hamerkop",
      "abstract": "Non-copulatory sexual behavior is surprisingly common among animals ranging from insects to vertebrates. Although sometimes considered unusual or aberrant within a species, in some taxa non-copulatory sexual behavior is widespread, and may even represent the majority of sexual behavior. Such behavior can also happen in many other contexts, including accidental contact, courtship, social bonding, and social structuring (Bagemihl 1999). Some non-copulatory sexual behavior is relatively easy to classify. For example, male–male mating in damselflies (Ischnura elegans) is thought to be maladaptive, likely a case of mistaking males for females (van Gossum et al. 2005); similar cases of mistaken identity are also found in vertebrates (eg garter snakes [Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis]; Shine et al. 2003). In other taxa, like shortfin mollies (Poecilia mexicana), non-copulatory sexual behavior may increase the likelihood of successful copulation (Bierbach et al. 2012), while, in some species, it may lead to same-sex social pairings or otherwise have an obvious influence on social structure (eg female–female pairs of Laysan albatrosses [Phoebastria immutabilis]; Young et al. 2008). The hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) is an unmistakable heron-like bird found in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southeastern Arabian Peninsula. Named for their distinctive \"hammerhead\", hamerkops are renowned for their massive enclosed nest structures, which may weigh over 90 kg (Wilson and Wilson 1986). Hamerkops build their nests in pairs but may aggregate in large numbers (>250 individuals in 4 km2) and associate in small social groups of up to 10 individuals (Kaweesa et al. 2012). In December 2012, in Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania, I observed a trio of hamerkops flying toward a flooded portion of road to drink. One individual picked up a stick from the water and walked to where a second individual stood after drinking (Figure 1); a third hamerkop stood some distance away and eventually flew off. The first individual appeared to present the stick to the second bird before laying the offering on the ground and jumping onto the second hamerkop's shoulders. The bottom individual stood in a flattened horizontal position (Figure 2). Several times, the bottom individual raised its tail to push against the lowered tail of the top individual, but no cloacal contact was attempted. The duo stood like this for several minutes, with the top hamerkop fanning its wings, perhaps to maintain its balance. Afterwards, the top individual jumped down, and the duo walked off the road into the woods, abandoning the stick. Interestingly, stick displays have not been documented in hamerkops, though two distinct forms of stick displays are common in other Ciconiiformes (Kahl 1967). The \"Twig Shake\" is a courtship display in herons and egrets, in which one bird grasps a small twig with its bill and vigorously shakes it (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). More similar to the behavior that I observed, however, is the \"Stick Presentation\", which is part of the greeting ceremony between mated pairs in related species during the beginning of the breeding season (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). This ritualized behavior occurs when one individual retrieves a stick suitable for nest building, approaches its partner, and presents it, often with a bow or a call. These behaviors are thought to help develop the pair bond, and may precede both nest building and copulation (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). The stick handling I observed closely parallels the Stick Presentation ritual described above, and could therefore potentially be a rare social behavior in hamerkops, perhaps serving as a prelude to the non-copulatory mounting that followed. Given that these hamerkops were seen near a nest, however, it is also possible that the hamerkop that picked up and carried the stick may simply have been distracted from bringing this nest-building material to the nest by mounting its companion, as hamerkops generally collect such material individually (Kahl 1967). In pairs and in groups, hamerkops have been documented performing so-called \"ceremonial\" behaviors, including non-copulatory mounting between both mates and unmated individuals (Kahl 1967). Non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops occurs in all combinations of sexes, including reverse mounting (female mounting male) and same-sex mounting by both males and females (MacFarlane et al. 2007). Hamerkops have even been observed conducting round-robin reciprocal mounting in trios and quartets, and even \"stacking\", where three or four individuals stand on each other's backs, forming a tower (Bagemihl 1999; MacFarlane et al. 2007). These behaviors suggest that non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops likely plays a broader social role than simple courtship, and the widespread nature of this behavior suggests that it is unlikely to simply be an aberrant behavior for this species. Non-copulatory mounting is common in birds, and is documented in more than 120 species from 37 families (Balcombe 2006). While many cases of non-copulatory mounting are clearly associated with courtship or pair bonding (Nuechterlein and Storer 1989), some avian mounting appears to be related to social interaction outside of the pair bond. Blue-bellied rollers (Coracias cyanogaster), for instance, breed and maintain territories in pairs, and use non-copulatory mounting in agonistic situations, potentially as a dominance contest (Moynihan 1990). Social avian species may use non-copulatory mounting to maintain group dynamics (Cockburn 2004). Harris' hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), for example, exhibit a behavior similar to that of hamerkops, termed \"back-standing\" or \"stacking\", where subordinates perch on the backs of dominants, sometimes for extended periods of time (Dawson and Mannan 1991). Similarly, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) mount each other prior to roosting (\"pre-roost mounting\"), when emerging from roost holes, and during fights for breeding vacancies; these behaviors do not appear to serve as a prelude to copulation and are not associated with gender (Koenig and Walters 2014). The observation of an apparent Stick Presentation ritual suggests that the two hamerkops I observed were a mated pair, as this behavior occurs only between mated pairs in similar species. Nevertheless, non-copulatory mounting seems to be a social behavior rather than a sexual one. The inference that it plays primarily a pair-bonding or courtship role does not explain the prevalence of multi-individual mounting (both stacking and reciprocal series of mounts), and non-copulatory mounting between mated pairs of hamerkops has been described when a third individual approaches the nest structure, potentially to indicate non-aggression to the approaching bird (Smith 1977). Non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops is therefore probably a mechanism for structuring social interactions, and may serve to reinforce non-aggressive relationships. The potential for other undocumented pair-bonding rituals (eg Stick Presentation), and our lack of information on the purpose of known rituals, suggests that there is still much to learn about this species' social behavior. Although hamerkops are usually described as solitary, cooperative nest building, aggregate nesting, and large, non-breeding social groups have been documented (Steyn 1996). Hamerkops may use ritualized interactions to maintain social bonds with unrelated neighbors, allowing for aggregations when food is plentiful; conversely, hamerkop social groupings may be dynastic in nature, with nepotistic family groups that sometimes behave cooperatively (eg western bluebird [Sialia mexicana]; Dickinson et al. 2016). Further examination of social interactions, particularly using colored leg bands to mark hamerkops, and analysis of the parentage of those individuals, could provide insight into the complex social behavior of this unusual species.

Eine ausschließlich an der Lust orientierte Sexualität ohne Empfängnischance galt als Sünde: gleichgeschlechtliche Beziehungen, Empfängnisverhütung oder Selbstbefriedigung waren nicht erlaubt, da sie nicht auf eine Schwangerschaft ausgerichtet waren. Seit den 1960-er Jahren gab es in der Gesellschaft und dann auch in den Kirchen einen Aufstand gegen diese restriktive Sexualmoral, die auch in der Politik angekommen ist und zu einer Liberalisierung des Sexualstrafrechts geführt hat. Inzwischen gilt Sexualität als Privatsache, der Staat und die Gesellschaft halten sich raus, solange alles einvernehmlich praktiziert wird. Diese Entfesslung der Sexualität führt zu einer Vermehrung sexueller Handlungen, könnte man meinen. Umso überraschender ist es, dass sexuelle Aktivitäten auf breiter Ebene zurückgehen. Bei vielen scheint sich eine gewisse Orientierungslosigkeit breit zu machen.",

Our chapter concerns the semiotic representation of a role performed in the main by older women: that of “grandmother”, a social category particularly associated with ageing. To explore this, we draw on image banks, corpus data, and other texts in order to discuss images, lexical/textual labelling, and their intermodal relations. We find in our visual data that grandmothers are contextualised in two ways: sharing semiotic resources of childhood or domestic contexts, or presented as transgressive actors, located in incongruous situations or performing behaviours inappropriate for their “age”. Our discussion of corpus data complements the multimodal analyses, providing further examples of stereotyping: while references to individual grandmothers often evaluate positively, there is also strong evidence of generic, figurative, and other usages that trivialise and derogate. Our conclusions point to processes of social devaluation: ageism and sexism are the pervasive and underlining ideologies recurrent in these representations. The broader implications are particularly relevant for the present time, as new forms of grandmothering appear.",

      "title": "Unleashed",
      "abstract": "Significant social change often comes from the unleashing of hidden preferences; it also comes from the construction of novel preferences. Under the pressure of social norms, people sometimes falsify their preferences. They do not feel free to say or do as they wish. Once norms are weakened or revised, through private efforts or law, it becomes possible to discover preexisting preferences. Because those preferences existed but were concealed, large-scale movements are both possible and exceedingly difficult to predict; they are often startling. But revisions of norms can also construct rather than uncover preferences. Once norms are altered, again through private efforts or law, people come to hold preferences that they did not hold before. Nothing has been unleashed. These points bear on the rise and fall (and rise again, and fall again) of discrimination on the basis of sex and race (and also religion and ethnicity). They also help illuminate the dynamics of social cascades and the effects of social norms on diverse practices and developments, including smoking, drinking, police brutality, protest activity, veganism, drug use, crime, white nationalism, \"ethnification,\" considerateness, and the public expression of religious beliefs.",

      "title": "Weaponized sex: Defensive pseudo-erotic aggression in the service of safety",
      "abstract": "Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries. Clinical interventions are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Little research has been conducted to examine paraphilic sexual interests in nonclinical samples. The little that exists suggests that atypical sexual interests are more common in men than in women, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. In this study, we explored the prevalence of paraphilic interests in a nonclinical sample of men and women. We expected that men would report greater arousal (or less repulsion) toward various paraphilic acts than women. We also examined putative correlates of paraphilias in an attempt to explain the sex difference. In all, 305 men and 710 women completed an online survey assessing sexual experiences, sexual interests, as well as indicators of neurodevelopmental stress, sex drive, mating effort, impulsivity, masculinity/femininity, and socially desirable responding. As expected, significant sex differences were found, with men reporting significantly less repulsion (or more arousal) to the majority of paraphilic acts than women. Using mediation analysis, sex drive was the only correlate to significantly and fully mediate the sex difference in paraphilic interests. In other words, sex drive fully accounted for the sex difference in paraphilic interests. The implications of these findings for understanding the etiology of atypical sexual interests are discussed.",

This process, defined as psychological selection, is strictly related to the quality of subjective experience.

It is characterized by high involvement, deep concentration, intrinsic motivation, and the perception of high challenges matched by adequate personal skills. The associated activities represent the basic units of psychological selection.

      "abstract": "Abstract First described in ancient Greece, hysteria was perpetuated in Western medicine as a typical female malady associated with the womb. It became a kind of catch-all disease for behaviour in women that either departed from traditional gender roles or that exaggerated them, such as extreme states of emotion. Though hysterical symptoms had always been linked to reproductive disorders, by the eighteenth century doctors began to ascribe such behaviour more generally to sexual or ‘genital’ abnormalities. In the nineteenth century, debates raged about whether hysteria was a constitutional or a psychological disorder and whether it was caused by too little sexual activity or too much. The fact that hysteria could now be considered a species of sexual illness meant that it could also claim male victims, though women continued to make up the overwhelming majority of hysteria patients in insane asylums. The British alienist (psychiatrist) Robert Brudnell Carter argued in 1853 that hysteria was a psycho- sexual illness brought on by the repression of sexual thoughts and activity in modern civilization (Extract 55).",

      "title": "Lessons in romance from middle-aged men who have had affairs",
      "abstract": "Popular talk of romance often involves what men do to court women, and elaborates on women's needs and fantasies. Our culture doesn't appear to worry itself much with the emotional needs of men in relationships, too often dismissing a male's sexual needs as being purely physical. But does that reflect a man's internal reality? Does it even represent the external reality of heterosexual relationships? Do women romance men? If so, how? Recently I witnessed middle-aged men in my practice examining their sexuality with unusual candor. Our discussions led to some surprises. They were re-evaluating their lives in light of changing circumstances, and sexual issues were of concern, especially as waning libido and declining physical abilities made them aware that their sexual lives might not last forever. Several of them were relieved to talk about extramarital affairs. Their descriptions clarified for me how psychoanalytic discussions were currently not inclusive of their ideas. Integral to their experience was the notion of sexual \"generosity\", the antithesis to the \"body narcissism\" of spouses who regularly refused sexual engagement. These men searched for an antidote in the nurturance and other-centered behavior of mistresses, where they discovered a sense of invitation, respect, and even merger, establishing a foundation of acceptance and love of their physical selves. These men recalled how their mistresses romanced them in and out of the bedroom by centering on their needs. Whether through the suggestion of a sexual treat, engagement in a man's favorite outdoor activity, or offering a massage, such responsiveness was unexpected and deeply moving. Erotic acts and dirty talk were often known to be a gift for which these men were grateful. The case material demonstrates complex dynamics where these patients were plagued with ambivalent feelings, guilt, rage, and relief. Some were delightfully confused, being romanced for the first time in their lives. Others used affairs to assuage anger caused by marital rejection and deprivation. The resulting guilt was felt to preserve the marriage. After all, how can you be enraged at someone you've betrayed? A therapist's tendency to be repelled by tales of cheating on an unsuspecting spouse can interfere with the ability to assess the root causes and emotional impact of an affair. I hope this material will contribute to a needed new perspective, and suggest a sexual theory that acknowledges two forms of sexuality: the first, short-term and novel; the second, long-term and comforting, affirming a connection between stable longstanding relationships and sexual arousal. This theory would avoid the dismissal of sexual behavior as being solely predicated on drive discharge and acknowledge that sexuality can originate in the physical excitement that comes with establishing abiding trust and connectedness within a secure relationship.",

      "abstract": "\"A woman's sex life ends with the menopause; Sex is for the young, I'm too old to bother with all that; older people are asexual.\" \"Later life sexuality in women is about words, images, ritual and fantasy as it is about the body\" Sexuality in older adults especially the sexual behavior of older women has been shrouded in discreet silence distaste and ignorance (Oppenheimer 2002).1 Recent literature however has demythologised sexuality and revealed that men and women continue to be sexually active well into old age. A recent study from US reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Lindau et al. 2007)2 reports that 73% of those 57-64 age, 53% of those 65-74 years of age and 26% of those 74-85 years of age reported to being sexually active (defined as any mutually voluntary activity with another person that involves sexual contact, whether or not intercourse or orgasm occurs). In all groups, sexual activity for men was higher. It is interesting that 35% of all women and 13% of all men interviewed said \"sex was not at all important\". It is recognized that leading an active and fulfilling sexual life is related to physical health, ability to function sexually, availability of a partner and perceptions of self esteem and body image (Lindau 2007; Clarke 2006).2,3 Overlying all of these is the personal knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the role of sexuality and sexual behaviors in wellbeing. With the 'Baby Boomer' generation coming of age as 'Older Adults', this presentation will explore whether the discourses of positive ageing have created the sexy ageless consumer as a personally and socially responsible citizen. Is the availability and apparent popularity of adult on-line dating for relationships; gyms and health fads for the healthy body; drugs and devices (sex toys such as the Eros clitoral device, and ben-wa balls); cosmetic treatments (Clarke 2006)3 and now surgical procedures for the body beautiful (Goodman et al. 2007)4 indicative of a need for assistance in sexuality?

En este artículo presentamos una revisión bibliográfica o Scoping Review de 29 artículos científicos que recogen estudios de opinión sobre esta materia. En ellos se aprecia la desaprobación social que, mayoritariamente, suscita la gestación por sustitución. Desde una perspectiva temporal, la tendencia es hacia su mayor aceptación. La población elige técnicas de reproducción asistida que garanticen el vínculo genético y que no impliquen la participación de terceros. En este sistema de preferencias, la subrogación es relegada socialmente al último lugar. Un número reducido de trabajos realizan análisis explicativos sobre los determinantes del nivel de aceptación de la subrogación. Temas controvertidos, como la subrogación comercial o cerrada, son escasamente incorporados en las encuestas de opinión pública. Cuando se interroga sobre la representación social de la mujer gestante, los marcos adoptados reproducen la imagen que proyectan los medios de comunicación obviando los hallazgos presentados tanto por la investigación etnográfica como por la interesada en evaluar los resultados de los acuerdos de subrogación. Los estudios de opinión enmarcan, mayoritariamente, la opinión de la población en un contexto médico. Los artículos que indagan sobre el grado de aceptación de la subrogación por causas “sociales” son excepcionales, a pesar de que el propio desarrollo de las técnicas de reproducción asistida se produce paralelamente a la emergencia de nuevas formas familiares.",

Yet little research has examined sexual and emotional satisfaction outside of the committed relationship context. Further, most satisfaction research has focused exclusively on heterosexual samples. The present study aimed to investigate sexual and emotional satisfaction derived from seven sexual relationship contexts and note similarities or differences based on gender and sexual orientation. Data were drawn from an online survey of 6,955 sexually diverse participants. Sexual satisfaction was stronger than emotional satisfaction within casual sex contexts (one night stand, first date, sex with a friend, and hookups) than within more committed contexts (married, living together, committed unmarried relationship). Men found all contexts except for sex in a committed unmarried relationship significantly more sexually and emotionally satisfying than women. Emotional and sexual satisfaction were significantly different across sexual orientation groups in casual sexual relationship contexts but not in more committed relationship contexts. Gay men reported gaining the most sexual and emotional satisfaction out of casual sex contexts, with lesbian women reporting the least out of casual sexual contexts. Overall, this research found that a wide variety of relationship contexts, including casual sexual contexts, can be a source of both sexual and emotional satisfaction.",

Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that disgust might compromise sexual functioning and can contribute to sexual problems. Although the stimuli and conditions that elicit disgust vary greatly across individuals, they cluster in three categories of disgust elicitors: Stimuli that are associated with an increased risk of the transmission of infectious diseases (pathogen disgust), stimuli that signal poor mating quality and may jeopardize reproductive success (sexual disgust), and behaviors that violate social norms (moral disgust). It has been argued that each of these categories of disgust may interfere with sexual responses. Thus far, research on the role of disgust in sexual contexts focused on external stimuli (e.g., sperm). Yet, recently it has been proposed that disgust can also become directed to features of the self. Such self-directed disgust may also apply to sexual contexts and contribute to sexual problems. As a first step to explore the relevance of self-disgust in sexual functioning, we tested if indeed particular sexual experiences have the ability to elicit self-disgust. Using a within subject design, participants (N = 124; all women) imagined themselves as well as others experiencing a series of sex-related scenarios, each relevant for one of the three categories of disgust, and subsequently rated their self-disgust. For all types of disgust, the scenarios evoked self-disgust, and the \"self-perspective\" elicited significantly more self-disgust than the \"other-perspective.\" These findings support theoretical models pointing to the relevance of taking self-disgust into consideration as a factor that may compromise sexual functioning. Future research should test whether this also holds for men.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "Introduction for the editors “LADIES FIRST!” This phrase today, perhaps more than the custom it refers to, sounds off, ill-advised, antiquated at best. One can hardly imagine a native speaker — and it would be a man, wouldn’t it? — uttering it at all, except humorously or with thinly veiled hostility. On “ladies,” the OED is loquacious — a very good read, and endlessly instructive. This word dates to the Middle Ages, and among its oldest senses are those that attribute some form of authority, to either a “woman who rules over subjects, a queen” or to the “female head of a household; a woman who has authority over servants, attendants, or slaves.” Chivalrous, religious, and courtly meanings follow in later centuries, with the more general and enduring usage — a mark of respect or courtesy — toward the end of this arc. The pejorative, sexist, and misogynist content implicit in nearly all such forms of address, not surprisingly, seems roughly coeval with the privileges it pretends to bestow. This is the master’s house, after all. The OED notes as well how the word appears, “In later use also (chiefly N. Amer.) in less formal contexts, sometimes with overtones of brusqueness or hostility.” Others may not agree, but I find this comment particularly revealing. The lexicographers cite a Canadian newspaper: “He said, ‘Look lady, you can deal with me or you can deal with the police’” (London Free Press, Nexis 15, July 4, 2007). Even more striking, perhaps, is the etymology of the term: “lady,” it turns out, comes from the Old English “hláfdige,” or “loaf-kneader,” with “lord,” correspondingly, from the Old English “hláford, once hláfweard,” namely, “loaf-keeper.” On the nature of the loaf, little is said (or needs to be). The through line uniting all these senses, etymological and lexical — the rope woven from each varied strand — is vocative. Throughout history, patriarchy has called women into assigned places and roles for them. These days, we often hear idle talk about our postfeminist or postracial society; in such moments, I generally think to myself, Well, clearly we’re not yet postidiocy. Certainly the two stories that open this issue, by Elizabeth Denton and Amy Collier, put the lie to that postfeminist fairy tale; both explore creative female lives framed in a world that still prefers its women procreative. Elsewhere, though separated by continents and cultures, Siobhan Phillips and Zaher Omareen (in an ALTA Award–winning translation by Alice Guthrie) map the mystical relations of production and [End Page 176] reproduction, demonstrating that the ingestion of food may well be our most deeply political act. And here the psychodelirotogenetical art of Dorothy Iannone — also featured in this issue — can lend a hand: one look at her cookbooks and you’re hooked. Similarly, in praise of the Folly Cove Designers, Jennifer Scanlon recovers a story from modern feminism’s pupal stage, showing us once again that all real progress is collective. Or perhaps I should say “teneral,” as Taije Silverman puts it in her poem “Grief,” one of this number’s lyrical highlights. The OED tells us that Silverman’s adjective is used to describe “the imperfect imago of a neuropterous insect, when it has just emerged from the pupa state, and is still soft.” We are none of us, ladies or otherwise, there yet: as Christa Romanosky’s second-person recipe for disaster suggests, knowing better is never enough. Such suffering is voiced also during Tim Seibles’s “Walk”: “the suspicion / that life would not / save us, that love itself / was little more than a hook / for the mouth.” Set inside the force field of feminism, this issue’s most memorable tales by men also stress the chains that still bind us. René Char’s dream of a drowned child, admirably rendered by Nancy Naomi Carlson, tells a tale of womb-envy. And we also note that Daniele Del Giudice’s fable of buying time, translated by the dynamic duo of Liz Harris and Louise Rozier, concludes in a vision of women’s temporality first coined by Julia Kristeva. Martín Espada’s revelation of one of Roberto Clemente’s greatest moments, long confined by racist commentary to...",

      "title": "Control of age at menarche.",
      "abstract": "The menarche stands as our primary indicator of onset of sexual maturity in females. The age at which this milestone occurs has therefore become one of major parameters of maturation rates among individuals, or among groups, and wide range of variation in age at menarche makes it a useful parameter. The factors which operate to create variability in menarcheal age are many, and involve hereditary and environmental determinants. Their interactions are quite complex and any attempt to isolate significant associations must adopt a multifactorial design. Only in this way will nature of determining factors, particularly those associated with external environment, be discovered. Of all developmental milestones associated with adolescent years, menarche, by all odds, is most noteworthy. To researcher in child development, concerned parent, or growing child, onset of first menstrual period is a qualitative event of major significance, denoting achievement of a functional state which involves, if not ability to regularly conceive, at least hypothalamic control of ovarian cycle via pituitary gland. Although not every segment of society would view this phenomenon in such glowing physiological terms, to student of human development, connotation of sexual maturity and entry into a new set of biosocial interactions is unmistakable. Since virtually beginning of scientific study of child development, researchers have included recording of age at menarche among data obtained, although why has not always been apparent. Menarche does not indicate a functional reproductive system, anovular cycles being the rule rather than exception during adolescence (Israel, 1967). Menarche does not signal onset of growth spurt since major portion of adolescent growth has passed, by initiation of a menstrual cycle (Tanner, 1962). And, since there 1 Department of Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104.

Johnston is no presently-recognized phenomenon of comparable significance among males, utility of any set of observations regarding its occurrence is restricted to females. Nonetheless, despite foregoing, we have, and shall continue, to obtain, analyze, and report on ages at menarche among those samples which we study. After all, it is a qualitative event and one which is easily recordable, if simple methodological considerations are followed. In addition, age at menarche is correlated with most of other events and processes of adolescence. While some individuals may reject notion that maturation process proceeds as a unit ( Brown, 1966), others have pointed out many associations among measures of maturation (Boas, 1932; Shuttleworth, 1937, 1949; Tanner, 1962), so that age at menarche does become a very useful parameter. And finally, age at menarche among individual girls shows a remarkable range of variation. The earliest menarche yet recorded, reputedly in absence of endocrine tumors, central nervous system lesions, and like, occurred in a girl of 9 Уг months of age (Masterson, 1967), and idiopathic delays of puberty have been associated with menarcheal ages of 20 years or more. Among most samples, standard deviation of age at menarche is about ±2 years. Among samples of populations from around world, an equally striking range of variation exists in mean ages at menarche reported in literature. The earliest mean ages approach 12.3 years (Tanner, 1962; Hiernaux, 1968) and current upper end of range is to be found among Bundi of New Guinea highlands, whose average age at first menstruation is given as 18.8 years (Malcolm, 1966). Given a discrete event that shows such sensitivity to appropriate determinants, and such strong associations with other events, it is no wonder that an almost innumerable number of studies have appeared on subject. However, in view of wide variation in ages at menarche, and correlation of these ages with so many factors, truly analytic studies require a fair amount of sophistication in design in order to disentangle these factors. Unfortunately, designs of this sort are too often lacking in published literature so that we are, more often than not, left with papers which provide us only with answers in search of questions. Lest we be left with cavalier attitude that it is a simple matter to obtain menarcheal ages in a sample of females, even assuming that question may be asked and answered, let me note that recording errors may not only be quite large, but systematic as well. Recall data This content downloaded from 207.46.13.51 on Tue, 21 Jun 2016 06:04:58 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Control of Age at Menarche 161 are frequently incorrect due to fickle nature of our memories, and bias may be introduced by possibility that women whose menarcheal ages were later than average tend to display errors in memory which are less than those menstruating early. The most accurate way is to fit a probit line to yes-or-no distributions, by age, after assuring that age range is sufficient to catch very late maturers (Tanner, 1962). What, then, does regulate and control age at menarche in adolescent females, excluding direct hormonal influences? Unfortunately, answer seems to be everything. For, if one consistent conclusion is to be drawn from mass of studies on subject, it seems to be that, if two groups of females are contrasted in some way, their mean ages at menarche will probably differ. It is my purpose here to point out some_of most frequently reported and also some of most intriguing associations which may be noted so that truly multivariate control, if we may use such a word, may become more apparent. First of all, there are those associations which occur with other aspects of development such that they are consistent covariates of menarcheal age. Thus, age at menarche is correlated with other general measures of degree of biological maturation and growth timing. Nicolson and Hanley, in 1958, reported correlations between age at menarche and measures of development of secondary sex characteristics which ranged from 0.58 to 0.86 ( Nicolson and Hanley, 1958) . Earlier Simmons and Greulich (1943) and Shuttleworth (1949) analyzed much of existing data and recently Marshall and Tanner (1969) have reported on longitudinal study of children from National Children's Home in Harpenden, England. All reached generally similar conclusions: that age at menarche shows a high and positive correlation with other measures of maturation rate (Table 1). This relationship to a wide range of biological indicators is seen also in greater accuracy of skeletal age than chronological age in predicting occurrence of first menstruation (Simmons and Greulich, 1943; Andersen, 1968). Likewise, earlier menarche is associated with fatness in adolescent females (Bruch, 1941; Reynolds, 1951; Garn and Haskell, 1960; Hammar et al. 1972). For 200 females diagnosed as being clinically obese, Bruch, for example, noted that this advancement may be as much as IVz years. In fact, only samples whose mean ages at menarche are less than 12.0 years of age are study samples composed of obese females. Physique is another feature associated with menarcheal age, as Tanner (1962) has summarized.

Although it does not involve direct violent behavior, behaviors such as disturbing frequent phone calls, text messages, waiting and keeping watch around the workplace, university or home are among the persistent stalking behaviors. Persistent stalking can lead to an increase in the victim's feelings of fear and anxiety. Individuals exposed to this situation may experience psychological and/or physical health problems. According to researches, persistent stalking is a sexist act. The victims are mostly women. Stalking actions are generally carried out by men whom women know and have emotional relationships with. The difference between being a perpetrator or a victim in stalking actions depending on gender change also causes the formation of stalking myths in countries. In this study, stalking, which is a very current concept in the field of forensic sciences, was examined in terms of some sociological variables. Stalking and gender, the effects of honor culture and the meaning attributed to stalking in terms of gender were examined.",

There is also an increasing body of evidence which shows that mammalian behaviour patterns are basically female and that male patterns are determined by the action of the sex hormone testosterone on neural structures during critical phases of intra-uterine development (Seymour Levine, 1966). Ounsted and Taylor (1972) have proposed that the X chromosome is sexually neutral, essentially equivalent to an autosome, and that its role in sexual differentiation lies in that it maintains ovarian function in the female. The Y chromosome is sex-determining by causing potential autosomal and X-coded information to become manifest in the phenotype. This is achieved in part by determining the development of foetal testosterone during a critical phase of foetal life. In the absence of testosterone the fundamental female morphology would be established in either sex.",

      "abstract": "The reasons of sexuality inversion into a commodity are rooted in the phenomenon. Sexuality as a special commodity is determining not only by economic laws. Sexuality is not alienated from its producer. The dialogical nature of sexuality determinates the presence of the Other as an origin of sexual. The process of formation of sexuality is demonstrating the exigency in the Other. The Other becomes the arche of sexuality developments, outlining the possible borders of affinity. Sexuality is alienated from the individual without affinity of the Other, which becomes the commodity completely deprived of any attribution. In such situation the Other loses its value, there is only consumer relation, the essence of which is mere use. Such sexuality provokes peoples attitude to sex and body as to the commodity. Then the purpose of sexuality is satisfaction of physical needs. The given commodity is depreciated in the process of consumption as it can be replaced by any other countervalue with similar consumer qualities. The body is exploited in the creative process of the optative commodity, which forces to consumption. The individual will generate the idea of his or her sexuality, only when there is the Other. The knowledge of sexuality is promoted by its displays, which should be directed at someone. The knowledge of sexuality cannot be received a priori. Only through the perceptive experience of the Other it is possible to show the characteristic features of the same pattern of different sexualities (heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual). The individual, who is unaware of his or her own sexuality, is liminal. Sexuality conceals uncertainty while culture and sociality will not include the individual in the structure. The Other is necessary for the individual to hear his or her own sexuality. The requirement for the Other is basic in the process of sexual commercialisation: when there is no authentic Other, there is its replacement by a commercial image. The human being is in the illusion captivity concerning the harmony of the sold image of sexuality and the authentic sexuality, wishing to reach the feeling of affinity. Discharge from his or her own sexuality attracts the individual to commercial sexual images, seducing by visual perfection. The power of commercial culture leads to the embodiment of existence. Sexuality of the individual is formed through relations with the Other, when there is no authentic Other, there is its replacement by commercial image. The subject relation to the Other's sexuality causes marketability of sexual image, as the commercial success of any image does not depend on unequivocally positive estimation, unlike usual commodity. Sexuality as a commodity can be found in the individual character of the consumer the commercial image of sexuality is intentional. Referential character of consumption allows making transition from a broadcast commercial image of sexuality to his or her own bodiness.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic events have permeated our lives throughout history and across the globe, inflicting profound losses on individuals, families, and communities during warfare, armed conflict, natural disasters, and relational violence. Although many survivors of these events harness their resilience and cope without long-term negative mental health effects, others experience a range of physical and mental health conditions, including trauma- and stress-related disorders. With an emphasis placed on adult trauma survivors, the conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, complex trauma, and other stress-related conditions have been explored within a social context. Starting with a historical context, the following topics were addressed. The typologies of trauma were introduced including the definitions of Type I trauma—a single discrete event including natural catastrophes; Type II trauma—chronic and repetitive traumatic physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse; and Type IIII—severe and multiple abusive events with multiple perpetrators. Historical and intergenerational trauma reflect a collective of complex traumatic events throughout generations that resonate in subsequent generations in terms of ungrieved losses and survivor guilt, among other psychosocial issues. Cultural and racial trauma include chronic verbal and/or physical assaults that involve racialized bigotry. Combat trauma involves a combination of deployment stressors that have affected servicemembers in distinct ways with “signature injuries” associated with different wartime conflicts. The next section addresses the current typology of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>—V, noting the changes in diagnostic criteria, in particular related to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health responses to trauma vary a great deal based on a balance of risk and protective factors, often revealing noteworthy resilience and the absence of negative aftereffects. The neurobiological effects of trauma are addressed along with mental health conditions or disorders (e.g., acute stress response, PTSD, complex trauma, and anxiety disorders). Specific phase-oriented and multimodality treatment interventions are reviewed that focus specifically on the mental health conditions presented.

Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are theorized in terms of local investment strategies; the body ceases to be a stable spatial map of normalized functions and instead emerges as a highly mobile field of strategic differences. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer easily call upon the notions of unproblematic sex and sex role as organic aspects in ‘healthy’ natural objects like organisms and families. Likewise for race, ideologies of human diversity have to be developed in terms of frequencies of parameters and fields of power-charged differences, not essences and natural origins or homes. Race and sex, like individuals, are artefacts sustained or undermined by the discursive nexus of knowledge and power. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic.",

      "abstract": "Who would ever have thought that the result of the last ten years of sexual freedom and liberation, absence of obscenity laws, all sorts of scientific sexual research, the woman's liberation movement, X-rated movies and increased sexual education would be in some strange way a diminution of sexuality. I am not gainsaying the gains. They have been necessary and they have been tremendous. But it is also time to assess the losses and to see if anything can be done to minimize them. The losses seem to me to come out of a changing focus about sex from a spiritual-psychological one to a technical-anatomical one. People have somehow forgotten that sex-the essence of sexuality-always has been and still is in the mind. Passion is still not anatomical. Learning 37 different positions is not necessarily going to make sex more exciting. Men and women have very powerful and exciting orgasms in their dreams. There is no technique or anatomical stimulation there. Lightly touching the hand of a person you are romantically in love with or a person who is taboo may be more exciting than participating in an orgy. Somehow we all should know these basic facts about sex, but the emphasis of the past ten years has made us forget them. And in the forgetting we have lost a great deal of the excitement about sex. The first porno film can be a tremendous turn-on. But the fiftieth hardly is. Similarly we all were very turned on by the past ten years giving us license and removing restrictions and inhibitions. But now that that thrill-and it certainly was a thrill-is over, where are we? That thrill-like the first porno film-is gone. Other thrills we used to have are also gone-or at least diminished. Some people who have not lost the thrill are the ones who have a special perversion. I do not like to use this word because it has so many pejorative connotations. Yet it is a technically correct word and I know of no other one that specifically defines the drive of a person who has combined some very unconscious emotional gratification with his sexuality in an unusual form of sexual expression and who experiences a great deal of emotional satisfaction through it.

A lo largo de la historia, la homosexualidad ha sido vista desde distintas ópticas, dependiendo del momento histórico, respondiendo de formas muy diversas al contexto y sentir de la época. Para algunos, es una desviación, un desorden de la personalidad, una psicopatología, un estilo de vida, una transgresón a la imposición del modelo heteronormativo, una cuestión de moda, una búsqueda de nuevas experiencias, entre otros conceptos. La homosexualidad es la mayor atracción para relacionarse afectiva y eróticamente hacia personas del mismo género. El elemento que define la preferencia es la atracción, que no se refiere exclusivamente a la atracción sexual y erótica, sino también al simple y cotidiano hecho de que los seres humanos, al enfrentarse con un grupo mixto de personas, enfocarán su atención en individuos de un solo género en particular, con fundamento en el elemento esencial de la atracción. Así, es más adecuado y descriptivo hablar de preferencia de género en sustitución de la denominación de preferencia sexual u orientación sexual. Frente a la práctica generalizada de incluir toda conducta sexual no hetero sexual dentro de la perspectiva homosexual, habría que resaltar que la realidad homosexual, como la heterosexual, es muy compleja. Por ello no debe hablarse de homosexualidad sino de personas homosexuales, con historias, contextos y experiencias de vida distintas.",

Where desire exists so does a subject and object – that is to say desire is relational and socially constructed. For women, as well as for men, desire tells a cultural and therefore a gendered story. Despite 30 years of post-feminist social change, the thwarting of women's desire is pervasive and endemic to our culture. Intrapsychically, through the process of normal dissociation, desire resides in a self state that may remain out of awareness. In the psychotherapy relationship this dissociation may be shared by both therapist and patient resulting in a less fulfilling analysis. Copyright © 2004 Whurr Publishers Ltd.",

Yet, we have little hesitation in describing the two main topics of this volume—(1) self and social identity and (2) social and behavioral aspects of physical health and illness-as research areas whose current high levels of activity and productivity are likely to remain constant, if not intensify, in the foreseeable future.

Multiple psychological and behavioural symptoms of sexual violence have been described by various authors. These include excessive eroticisation of the child. Such abused children often display provocative and seductive sexual behaviour. Parents or guardians report depressed mood or anxiety in the child. Young victims of sexual offenses usually experience psychosexual problems and have low self-esteem, also in adulthood. Furthermore, masturbation inadequate for the stage of psychosexual development is another symptom, which was discussed in the historical context of sexual deviations involving children. There is full consensus in terms of sexology, sexual ethics and other sciences as well as strong social condemnation of sexual violence against children: the perpetrators are dangerous criminals, who sometimes try to justify their pathological sexual activity by describing it as ‘a harmless weakness of the elite which is rooted in antiquity’. However, this type of child abuse cannot be justified in any way.",

For this reason, neither biology nor psychology can provide the whole of any explanation of the social affair which is human sexuality. For a number of decades work carried out in a range of disciplines (cultural anthropology, sociology, history, social psychology, and feminism) challenged approaches to sexuality which emphasised its universal features (perceived as most prevalent within biological and psychological perspectives). They focused their attention on the social, cultural, economic and political forces shaping sexual variation. It is a field studded with conflicting positions on almost every aspect of theory and practice. One thing remains constant. Ironically, it is the fact of social diversity across time, and across and within cultures, which undercuts any easy claims of sexual universality and any easy standard of sexual normality.

Although some do not differentiate between the terms sexual identity and sexual orientation , literature that distinguishes between sexual identity and sexual orientation argues that the term sexual orientation refers to one's sexual predisposition.

      "title": "Men’s Provisioning of Oral Sex",
      "abstract": "Men sometimes engage in noncopulatory sexual behaviors, such as cunnilingus and other kinds of sexual foreplay. Men involved in long-term romantic relationships, in particular, tend to provision their partners with oral sex. Potential adaptive functions of cunnilingus in humans are discussed with a focus on the hypothesis that men use oral sex provisioning as part of a general benefit-provisioning, long-term mating strategy. Other potential adaptive functions are also considered, including the infidelity detection hypothesis and several hypotheses concerning sperm competition adaptations. Some research has proposed the possibility that men may use oral sex as a form of infidelity detection, wherein they might be able to smell or taste the semen of rival males in their partner’s vagina. Other research has posited that men might perform cunnilingus in order to induce orgasm in their partners, thereby increasing the amount of sperm retained in her reproductive tract after ejaculation. Still others have suggested that men might perform cunnilingus to increase their own arousal, thus increasing their subsequent ejaculate volume. These adaptive perspectives are couched within the wider literature on oral sex, which includes data regarding the frequency of oral sex in adolescent, preindustrial and non-Western samples, as well as women’s desire for receiving oral sex. Regarding the relative infrequency of cunnilingus in preindustrial and non-Western samples, in particular, men’s provisioning of oral sex is considered as potentially being a part of an evolved cognition for benefit-provisioning mate retention in general, rather than oral sex itself serving a specific adaptive function. Specifically, oral sex may be one type of sexual favor that men, especially those in Western cultures, sometimes provide to their long-term partners. Additional data regarding the increased sexual and relationship satisfaction in women who engage in a wider variety of sexual practices and who more frequently experience orgasm further supports the mate retention hypothesis of men’s provisioning of oral sex. Nevertheless, the available literature investigating these potential adaptive functions is currently insufficient to draw any decisive conclusions. Finally, gaps in the current literature and suggestions for future research that may help determine the evolved nature of men’s oral sex provisioning are discussed.",

      "title": "The Power of Pleasure Devices: Sex Toys and Dominance in Society and Pop Culture",
      "abstract": "1Human sexuality and its significance for conventions of social relations is a recurring topic in sociology. Viewed in the context of gender studies, it can be very well considered a relevant factor for the construction of hierarchies, especially in interpersonal relationships. The aspect of pleasure, viewed from both the receiving and giving perspective, produced in single or group constellations, determines the individual's relation to the role of sexuality in building or destroying confidence and consciousness about one's own position in the social environment. Nevertheless, sexual intercourse as a source of physical and consequently also mental comfort and satisfaction is nowadays not necessarily a matter depending on the human body exclusively. As shown here, various items are adapted in creative ways to either simulate interpersonal sexual acts or to enhance single or joint sexual experiences. Sex toys, as these devices are commonly labelled today, have a solid position in the sex industry, indicating not only their high popularity but also a fundamental demand for these products. By introducing such devices into one's own sexual life, they become relevant for the discourse created around the distribution of sexual power relations. This discourse is also shaped by the depictions and representations of sex toy use in cultural productions.2The following paper argues that the role of sex toys in the construction of hierarchy and distribution of power ultimately depends on the user's subjective perception of pleasure. However, there are numerous factors that have an impact on building this subjectivity. Those are, among others, perceptions of sex toy usage shaped by the dominance of heteronormativity and further, particular attitudes towards sex toys reflected in society and filmic text productions popular culture. To determine the interconnectedness of these factors, two perspectives are considered within this paper: firstly, different sets of research conducted and performed in either subjective or empirical forms, and secondly, the representation of sex toys in various 21st century films and TV productions.3The acknowledgement of the existence of devices built exclusively to deliver sexual pleasure only emerged in the 1960s (Maines 20), though devices that were associated with this function had been created a long time before. To classify the variety of devices that can serve to cause sexual pleasure, two differentiations have to be made: on the one hand, the historical context of the development of such devices and later, the categorization of more contemporary objects regarding their sexual functionality.4Firstly, the development of devices that functioned as sex toys but were not promoted and conceptualized with the expectation of arousal of sexual pleasure is a relevant factor for historical contextualization. These objects mainly appear in association with medical discourse and later, promotion of relaxation devices for the domestic sphere. The vibrator as a medical tool, for instance, emerged in the 1880s (Maines 11) with the purpose of clinically treating hysterical women, where the success of the procedure relied on the accomplishment of paroxysm, presently known as orgasm (Minge and Zimmerman 334). [1] Hysteria was commonly presented as a female disease and only lost its pathological status in 1952 (Maines 11) after sexuality ceased to be considered as serving only procreational purposes. At the same time, the focus of sexual discourse shifted to the pleasure bringing features of human intimacy. However, there is an explicit pathologization of female arousal in contrast to the absence of medical, either pathological or apithological, discourse around male sexuality led by the male-dominated medical community. Accordingly, this indicates an uneven distribution of agency in favor of the male-identified part of society (Maines 334), based on gender-bound distinctions of sexual normalcy. The absence of clinical interest in male sexuality then marks it as generic, or integrated, whereas the conscious investigation of female sexuality signifies it as deviant, justifying the investigation. …",

Some accounts of well-being imply that an agent's attitude (or lack thereof) towards an action (or its likely outcome) has a direct bearing on its welfare-value for her. Since paternalistic actions interfere with autonomy or rational self-governance, these accounts may imply that paternalistic actions cannot be overall beneficial, or else that they are always simultaneously harmful to a significant degree. Some even imply that paternalistic actions can never occur, because the autonomous choice of an end is a condition of its status as a welfare-good. This chapter evaluates several proposals of this kind, e.g., that rational self-direction, autonomous living, and the endorsement of ends are either conditions on personal benefit, or else non-instrumental welfare-goods, or else key instrumental goods. However, it is argued that there is no plausible account of personal well-being or any of the goods just mentioned that supports the claim that paternalistic action cannot succeed.",

      "title": "Assessing The Issues of Honour and Violence Against Women: A Human Rights Discourse Framework for The Detection of Violence Against Women",
      "abstract": "The term 'Honour Killing' is conventionally used to denote a specific category of extralegal killings where the act of murder is seen to have been motivated by pre-modern affiliations/sentiments of some sort. Acts of violence committed against people for marrying outside of caste/religion/ethnicity or other similar infringements where they are seen by their actions to have besmirched the honour of the family and the larger community come under the broad rubric of honour crime. Implicit in using the term are assumptions that mark it as different from other crimes. Honour is defined in terms of women assigned sexual and familial roles as dictated by traditional family ideology. Thus, adultery, premarital relationships (which may or may not include sexual relations), rape, and falling in love with an \"inappropriate\" person may constitute violations of family honour. 'Crimes of honour' as a form of violence against women does not imply that men also are not subjected to such crimes. In cases of forced marriage or interference with the right of choice and whom to marry, pressure from older family members over younger members will apply to men as well as to women. However, women remain the victims and survivors of 'crimes of honour' and have fewer available remedies.",

      "title": "Visitor Effects",
      "abstract": "Visitor effects are the behavioral and/or physiological changes that occur in animals when they are in proximity to unfamiliar people. These changes, if they occur at all, may be considered negative if they appear to challenge the animals' ability to cope and could thus compromise welfare, or positive if they appear to enhance the animals' welfare state. Visitor effects may be influenced by housing and husbandry, the behavior of people, individual characteristics of the animals, and their species. Negative visitor effects can often be reduced by providing animals with more opportunities to avoid public view. Previous research suggests that visitor effects are negative for many captive primates, indicating that human proximity is stressful, but in most cases the effect does not seriously compromise animal welfare.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pedophilia is typically defined as sexual attraction to prepubescent children, reflected in a person's sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, sexual arousal, or behavior regarding children (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; World Health Organization, 1997). There are two key aspects to emphasize in this definition: first, the sexual interest in children is persistent, and second, the children of interest are prepubescent and thus show few or no signs of secondary sexual development. This means that someone who has expressed a sexual interest in children or who has engaged in sexual behavior involving a child is not necessarily a pedophile. It also means that individuals who are attracted to sexually maturing children or sexually mature adolescents, even if they are below the legally defined age of consent, are unlikely to be pedophiles.",

Moreover, and with the exception of recently emergent “spandrels,” each can be accorded a teleological dimension—each is “for” some purpose conducive to an organism's continuation. Sex, which is “for” the generation of recombinant genomes, may be one of the most ancient and ubiquitous traits in biology. In the course of its evolution, many additional traits, such as gender and nurture, have emerged. Patterns of sexual exchange are the basis for patterns of biological evolution and are central to the process of eukaryotic speciation. Human sexuality is central to our selves.",

      "title": "Eating Disorders: Traumatic Context and Interventions",
      "abstract": "Historically, women's eating disorders have been denominated with such terms as 'chlorosis', 'neurasthenia' and 'hysteria'. Since the 1970s an increase in eating disorders have been noticed, possibly correlated with the general phenomenon of cultural gender role change, posited as attributable to the confusion between the terms 'sex' and 'gender'. The biological term 'sex' works for both female and male, while the socially given term 'gender' is either masculine or feminine. This traumatic bifurcation implicitly involves a cultural dualism. The theoretical consideration of eating disorders has been likened to the crystallisation of culture, with three cultural axes: the dualist axis, control axis, and gender/power axis. Dualism can be thought of as a denied dependency on a subordinated or traumatised other. Within this frame, human existence bifurcates into two territories or substances: that of the body and materiality, as contrasting that of the mental and spiritual. The body must be escaped from a prison and an enemy with which to struggle. In this battle, thinness represents a triumph of the will over the body. The control axis is informed by the experience of one's hungers as being out of control. One's ability to ignore hunger and pain evidences one's control over one's own body, often the only control one experiences. The gender/power axis is informed by the experience of one's 'female' portions of one's body, usually at menarche, as a disgusting appropriation of one's body by fat. These symptoms emerge as an unconscious protest at the limitations of the traditional female role. Successful interventions with eating disorders take these intersecting factors into account. This chapter will expose the range of current treatment interventions in consideration of the traumatic context.",

Functionally, social behavior is associated with the organization of a specific local population of animals, and, as such, will be concerned with the organization of the group within space and, especially, with reproductive activities. Social structure is usually fundamental to reproductive activity. Thus some non-reproductive social behavior, such as territorial behavior, often actually subserves reproduction. However, social structure is frequently a function of mating relationships and other reproductive interactions. For example, aggressive behavior results in the ascendency of the cock to the top of the hierarchy in flock structure and this position results in his maintaining greater mating access to hens. Or, in territorial species, the ability to successfully acquire and defend territory can lead to breeding activity and reproductive success. Social behavior, like other . . .",

      "abstract": "Long-term relationship is associated with decreasing sexual desire, frequency and satisfaction in both men and women. As well, relationship length is associated with increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The increase in sexual motivation resulting from the addition of a novel sexual partner has been the focus of a large number of animal studies including male rodents, chimpanzees and fruit flies. Experimental studies in humans showed consistently habituation of sexual arousal to erotic material. Repetitive display of a single erotic slide resulted in less subjective and physiological sexual arousal than exposure to different and novel slides. The presence of novel sexual partners in sexual fantasies, and the frequency with which extra-marital relationships occur, is also consistent with the importance of novelty in sexual desire. On the other hand, most men and women by the age of 40 will be married, in order to achieve safety, permanence, a better care for offspring and pooling resources. Such a social monogamy is generally accompanied by the expectation of sexual monogamy. Is it possible to combine a happy long-term marriage that keeps sexuality alive? The role of the dopaminergic reward system, attention, psychiatric disorders and socio-cultural factors will be discussed.",

Many reports of sexual dimorphism in physical aggression favouring the male in laboratory rodents appear to select circumstances where that expectation is supported. Other situations that favour the expression of conflict in females have been (until recently) relatively little studied. Although female rodents generally do not show the “ritualised” forms of conflict that characterise male sexual competition, they can use notably damaging strategies (especially if they are of short duration). Such considerations might weigh in the selection of strategies by our own species.",

It might result in the explanation of many characteristics of the neuroses. Homosexuality is a wholesale inversion. Recognition of the sexual lie in themselves and in adults cannot be repressed by children without a substitute formation, and a number choose for the representation of their feelings the formula which children use otherwise also for the representation of an untruth: inversion. But the inversion of the libido generally takes place only in puberty, when sexual desires arc biologically strengthened and are therefore inhibited and transposed to the infantile level.",

      "abstract": "The importance of primal-scene experience is suggested by the wide range of attention it has received, with a multitude of derivative phenomena being attributed to its influence. Emphasis has been on possible psychiatric problems, and almost all available reports are clinical and anecdotal. The classical psychoanalytic view has been that such stimulation, be it through actual witnessing or fantasy, results (especially in children) in experience of anxiety, intense eroticization, and sadomasochistic confusions about sexuality. It is suggested here that issues of affectional love and fears of aloneness and feelings of vulnerability may often be the focus of primal-scene reactions. A wide range of evidence has been presented here to support the view that primal-scene experience per se is not necessarily deleterious, and that traumatic or pathogenic effects usually occur only within a context of general brutality or disturbed family relationships. In contradistinction, some emphasis here has been placed on possible positive effects of primal-scene experience. There is a clear need for further study, especially among nonpsychiatrically selected persons, for understanding to be advanced regarding the vicissitudes of both normal and pathological primal-scene experience.",

      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

      "abstract": "Only within the past decade have social scientists commonly recognized the phenomenon of sexual desire as a distinct and vital component of human sexual response. Of the various factors believed to be associated with sexual desire, gender (biological sex) is presumed by many theorists to be one of the most important. Limited empirical work suggests that men experience desire more frequently than do women; however, sex differences in intensity or level of desire have yet to be examined. This study explored both the self-reported frequency and intensity of sexual desire among an ethnically diverse sample of 676 men and women. As hypothesized, men reported experiencing a higher overall level of sexual desire than did women. Sex differences also were found with respect to frequency of sexual desire. Men reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and, when asked to estimate the actual frequency with which they experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week). These results do not imply that men always feel desire or that women lack sexual desire. In fact, virtually every participant in this study reported feeling sexual desire on a regular basis. This suggests that desire may be the most universal sexual response experienced by both men and women.",

      "abstract": "The attachment of the infant to the mother can be seen in open parkland when an infant is set free for exercise and play. In an area of safe space, a mother has little cause to restrain her child, nor, owing to other attractions around, to entertain or otherwise divert him. In order to deduce which of the women and infants make up kinship pairs, the observer postulates criteria for recognizing a pair; attachment is then conceived of as factors which identify a mother and her infant in field conditions. The infant detaches himself from his mother but he maintains proximity to her, particularly around the age of 2 years, when his proximity- and contact-seeking are at their height. Yet, at this age, the infant shows most alertness to remote events. From 2 years old onwards, the presence of age-mates competes for the infant's proximity. Hence, the statistical data presented below is from observations which were made when the likelihood of interruption by neighbouring people was minimal. Proximity to the mother can be defined as the child's being at rest beside her, or as his playing in her vicinity, or as a pattern of exploratory locomotion with the mother the centre of the territory he covers. In each of these aspects, the behaviour of 1-, 2- and 3-year-olds is distinguished by typical distances from the mother. The infant's responsiveness to unexpected sights or sounds is inferred from the orientation responses he makes to them. In his postures and the distances he takes up from the mother, his feeling-states of alertness, fear, anger, uncertainty, fatigue and conflict are expressed; when thus activated, he tends to relate himself to his mother.",

Similar to other kinds of friendships, such as same‐sex friendships, inter‐racial friendships, and friendships of sexual minorities, cross‐sex friendships are characterized by generic benefits in the form of mutual trust, loyalty, fun, enjoyment, and social support as well as the unique benefit of providing insider perspectives on how members of the other sex think, feel, and behave. Historically, the distinguishing characteristic of a cross‐sex friendship has been that the friends are of different biological sexes and their internal gender identities match their physical bodies (i.e., cisgendered individuals). However, recent research argues for a broader definition of cross‐sex friendships that includes transsexuals (Monsour and Rawlins, 2014).",

Data analysis using the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics revealed that increased discrimination frequency was associated with higher levels of mental illness diagnosis, psychological distress, substance use, and languishing for up to 6 years after initial exposure.2 Clinicians should know 3 aspects vital to combating discrimination in health care: the impact of interpersonal discrimination, the role of implicit bias in perpetuating disparities, and decolonizing medical education and training.First, interpersonal discrimination (sometimes called individual discrimination) refers to conscious or unconscious acts of prejudice committed by a member of a dominant or privileged group toward a member(s) of a marginalized group. Acts of interpersonal discrimination (ie, microaggressions) can manifest as lack of respect toward a person as well as marginalizing, undervaluing, and scapegoating a person. Experiences with acts of interpersonal discrimination have been found to contribute to poor mental health and physical health outcomes in children, adolescents, young adults, and adults. Within the health care setting, this can include making disparaging comments to a patient or colleague about their weight, accented speech, name, or religious affiliation.3–6 Acts of interpersonal discrimination in health care also include failing to provide translation services for patients who are fluent in languages other than spoken English; making assumptions about a patient's intelligence on the basis of their economic status, educational level, or geographic origin; or refusing to see patients who are members of sexual or gender minority groups.7–9Secondly, acknowledging, mitigating, and eliminating the impact of implicit biases within the health care system is critical. Evidence suggests that clinicians endorse negative implicit biases toward race, sex, weight, age, and mental illness that are similar to those in the general population.10 Studies have found that clinicians' negative implicit biases influence how they communicate with their patients, influence the treatments they recommend, and influence patient satisfaction ratings.11 The Joint Commission report on implicit bias in health care suggested useful strategies for addressing implicit bias, including perspective-taking (the cognitive aspect of compassion that can reduce bias and deter unconscious stereotypes and prejudices), emotional self-regulation (experiencing positive emotions during patient encounters to build rapport, trust, and connection), and partnership building (working collaboratively with patients toward a common goal).12Lastly, we must address bias and discrimination in trainee curricula and continuing medical education. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) included in the Common Program Requirements that a trainee must demonstrate competence in \"respect and responsiveness to diverse patient populations, including but not limited to diversity in gender, age, culture, race, religion, disabilities, national origin, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation.\"13 ACGME has 6 core educational competencies, but none specifically address bias, discrimination, and inequity. To fill this training gap, a new ACGME competency has been proposed: Structural Competency, Health Equity, and Social Responsibility.14 This includes 3 subthemes that address knowledge, skills, and attitudes: structural competency (eg, understand implicit and/or explicit race and/or gender bias and its effects on health outcomes, health inequities, and patient care), structural action (eg, incorporate direct interventions on patients' social and structural determinants of health into all physician functions), and structural responsibility (eg, examine the ethics of patient care decisions, with a focus on structural vulnerability and reducing the inequities faced by historically marginalized and oppressed populations).14 The American Board of Pediatrics has an updated entrustable professional activity for general pediatrics, number 14, entitled \"Use Population Health Strategies and Quality Improvement Methods to Promote Health and Address Racism, Discrimination, and Other Contributors to Inequities Among Pediatric Populations\" to address racism, other social determinants of health, clinician bias, and health inequities.15 This entrustable professional activity is focused on the following: clinician personal responsibility to their community and society, identifying populations at risk for poor health outcomes, cooperating with diverse stakeholders on creating and implementing initiatives to improve health outcomes, analyzing data from various resources for quality improvement and/or population health initiatives, and undoing the systems and processes that are rooted in discrimination that have led to health care inequities.15 To mitigate the influence of implicit biases on clinical decision-making, researchers from the Royal College of Physicians have suggested a checklist for determining if clinicians' biases influence clinical decision-making.16 This checklist includes items that analyze how one reached a diagnosis and whether stereotypes were used.16Interpersonal discrimination contributes to poor physical and mental health outcomes for children, adolescents, and adults. Clinician biases and discriminatory actions in practice and/or in training against patients based on their demographic characteristics can lead to serious health consequences. Clinicians play a central role in recognizing and addressing interpersonal discrimination in health care settings and during patient encounters. Institutions have a responsibility of addressing interpersonal discrimination within the work environment and with patient care activities. Committing to reducing and eliminating interpersonal discrimination in health care will promote a healthier society.",

But the penis has another anal–erotic significance apart from its relation to the interest in a baby. The relationship between the penis and the passage lined with mucous membrane which it fills and excites already has its prototype in the pregenital, anal–sadistic phase. As the interest in faeces recedes in a normal way, the organic analogy has the effect of transferring the interest on to the penis. Anal erotism finds a narcissistic application in the production of defiance, which constitutes an important reaction on the part of the ego against demands made by other people. An organic analogy between penis and baby is expressed by the existence of a symbol common to both.",

It should be enjoyed and should occur with a reasonable degree of frequency, and after a conflict is over the people involved should feel better than they did before. Some psychiatrists and social scientists have given conflict a bad reputation by linking it with psychopathology, social disorder, and war. Conflict can be dysfunctional, but it also can be productive. It has many positive functions, including preventing stagnation and stimulating interest and curiosity. It is the medium through which problems can be aired and solutions developed. It is the root of personal and social change. The practical and scientific issue is not how to eliminate or prevent conflict but rather how to have lively controversy rather than deadly quarrels. A conflict exists whenever incompatible activities occur. The incompatible actions may originate in one person, group, or nation (intrapersonal, intragroup, or intranational) or they may reflect incompatible actions of two or more persons, groups, or nations (interpersonal, intergroup, or international). An action that is incompatible with another action prevents, obstructs, interferes, injures, or in some way makes the latter less likely or effective. A potential conflict exists when the parties involved perceive themselves to have incompatible values, interests, goals, needs, or beliefs.",

Three main countertransferences that interfere with accurate identification of battered women are described: (1) counter- identification, (2)countertransference rage, and (3) countertransference helplessness. Battering men and battered women are found in all levels of society, although younger, lower income, less-educated men who have observed parental violence in their own home are at higher risk of abusing their spouses. Additionally, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and/or alcohol and drug abuse increase the risk of male violence in the home. Contrary to popular belief, the husband-to-wife violence is usually motivated by his need to control her rather than a result of his loss of control. Battered women show no consistent prebattering risk markers, except for a history of parental violence in their family of origin. Violence against women by their male partners is a serious public health problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical and psychiatric professions. Myths and clinical realities of battered women are described and detailed recommendations for clinical inquiry and evaluation of level of danger are given.",

      "title": "“The Proof Is in the Pudding”: How Mental Health Practitioners View the Power of “Sex Hormones” in the Process of Transition",
      "abstract": "Feminist Studies 41, no. 3. © 2015 by Feminist Studies, Inc. 623 Jaye Cee Whitehead, Kath Bassett, Leia Franchini, and Michael Iacolucci “The Proof Is in the Pudding”: How Mental Health Practitioners View the Power of “Sex Hormones” in the Process of Transition In the United States today, popular discourse touts the power of “sex hormones” and hormone receptors in the brain to chemically produce gender expressions (manifested in physical sex traits, behaviors, and attitudes) and identities (a sense of self as feminine or masculine). These accounts range from common assumptions that Western ideals of femininity (such as empathy understanding, cooperative orientation, nurturing behavior) and masculinity (rational/spatial understanding, competitive orientation, violent behavior) are produced by corresponding sex hormones, to studies that reduce complex gender identities and macrosocial economic phenomena to presocial, binary, hormonal processes.1 For sociologists, accounts that reduce complex identities to internal hormonal reactions are problematic for two primary reasons: first, they are inaccurate because they fail to examine how hormonal reactions are embedded in a complex cultural process of meaning and interpretation; second, they operate as bioreductive ideologies that obscure the social power inherent to the process of gender identity construction. In what follows, we extend both of these insights by examining mental health 1. For an example of a hybrid popular-scientific account of the power of sex hormones to destabilize economic structures, see Jon Coates and Joe Herbert , “Endogenous Steroids and Financial Risk Taking on a London Trading Floor,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105, no. 16 (April 2008): 6167–72. 624 Whitehead, Bassett, Franchini, and Iacolucci practitioners’ divergent interpretations of the power of sex hormones in the process of gender transition.2 In doing so, we examine the cultural power of sex hormones in crafting gender identities without reproducing reductionist interpretations of trans embodiment. Perhaps what is most perplexing about the way we speak of sex hormones is that we know it is inaccurate to describe these hormones as sexed; scientists have acknowledged since the 1930s that they are neither sex specific in their function, nor in terms of their location in male or female bodies.3 In her extensive historicization of sex hormones, Anne Fausto-Sterling concludes that it is more accurate to call androgen- and estrogen-based hormones, “steroid hormones” as they have functions that are not confined to corresponding sexed bodies. In fact she urges scientists to “break out of the sex hormone straightjacket” and to look at steroids as just one of a number of components that are important to the creation of sex and gender, including environment and experience.4 Scholars also point to an inextricable link between the chemical operation of hormones and the social process of constructing meaning, both at the level of social interaction and macrocultural constructions of sex categories and gender ideologies.5 While brain organization/activation theory attributes sex and gender differences to hormonal interactions within the developing brain, Fausto-Sterling questions the distinction between activation and organization by pointing out how “the brain can respond to hormonal stimuli with anatomical changes…hormonal systems, after all, respond exquisitely to experience, be it in the form of nutrition, stress, or sexual activity (to name but a few possibilities ).”6 Drawing from Elizabeth Grosz, Fausto-Sterling argues that the power of hormones is best understood according to the model of the 2. “Gender transition” is a controversial phrase, as it implies that transgendered individuals who receive hormone therapy are changing identities. We are only using it for lack of clear alternative phrasing, not because we believe body modifications change gender identities. 3.

In this qualitative study, we conducted content and thematic analyses of the sexual fantasies reported by an international sample of 112 adults reporting sexual attraction to minors recruited online. Seven themes were found: Minor-focused fantasies, Other paraphilic fantasies, Unrealistic fantasies, Incestuous fantasies, Adult-focused fantasies, Promiscuous fantasies, and Group sex fantasies. The sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minors exhibited diversity both in terms of the individuals involved and in the range of sexual practices imagined. However, much of the sexual fantasy content shared by participants was predominantly of a paraphilic nature. Approximately one-third of the fantasies involved minor as sexual partners, romantic partners, or featured participants imagining themselves as minors. Additionally, nearly half of the disclosed sexual fantasies referenced other paraphilic sexual interests, such as violence, fetishism, exhibitionism/voyeurism, body fluids, and zoophilia. Results of our research highlight the possibility of co-occurring paraphilic interests in adults reporting sexual attraction to minors.",

      "abstract": "Although women live longer lives than men, they tend to have poorer health status. Here, we review the biological and socio-behavioral factors that may contribute to this sex-frailty paradox. The conceptual framework that frailty is a product of the environment and the recovery rate provides a new understanding of women's frailty burden. Even developed countries may present an environment more adverse for women, and lifestyle factors may increase women's vulnerability to stochastic subcellular events that increase recovery time. The frailty index does not reach the theoretical maximal value of 1; its limit is lower in men (0.61) compared to women (0.69). Perhaps deterministic characteristics omitted in current deficit counts, such as reduced emotional adaptability, are more prevalent in men. Alternatively, different limits may result from quantitative evolutionary design, such as a fitness-frailty pleiotropy in men or fertility-frailty pleiotropy in women. The engineering principle of safety factors (maximal capacity divided by routine functioning) may also be informative. If the human system has the same safety factor as its organs (approximately 2.5), men may be 'calibrated' around a frailty index of 0.244, compared to 0.276 for women. Because 0.25 represents the tipping point between functional independence and reliance on others, evolutionary design may have allowed for some limited dependence in women, perhaps motivated by the perinatal period.",

      "abstract": "An axiom of medicine is to diagnose and treat a disease in its formative stages before it becomes so advanced that treatment is difficult or impossible. The same theme runs through aspects of neonatology and developmental pediatrics—organ systems and processes are laid down early in development and supportive or deleterious factors operating during these early stages can permanently influence or alter the course of development. Belief in \"formative Stages was applied to behavior by Sigmund Freud who emphasized the crucial contribution of early experiences to adult personality. A half century later, the same general principle was used to justify Head Start, an educational program that was supposed to equalize the social classes by providing an intellectual boost to disadvantaged children during their formative years. The principle of \"formative years\" pervaded theory and practice in developmental psychology for decades, but there were always dissonant findings. For example, five decades of research shows quite clearly that test scores obtained within the first year or two of life do not predict later intelligence for normal children.1 Weight and especially skinfold thickness assessed during infancy do not predict later weight or obesity, and early social disadvantage and stress do not necessarily lead to later psychosocial dysfunction. Indeed, today the emphasis in some quarters of developmental psychology is on change, modifiability, and unpredictability in development rather than on consistency.2",

      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is not only an individual health issue but also a public health issue. While sexual abuse is a physical and psychological health issue for an individual, with multiple and varied repercussions, it also involves aspects of the earliest bonds, the bonds of attachment, since it usually takes place within the family circle. In light of three clinical case studies, the article discusses the concept of destructiveness both generally and specifically in situations of sexual abuse, in order to propose some key points concerning the child’s speech during treatment. It should be pointed out that the child, whether or not he or she confides in the clinician, is often psycho-traumatized. Destructiveness relates to the destructive nature of a living or non-living element and, more generally, to the ability to destroy. In connection with this notion, we can generally observe so-called gravity factors and other so-called protective factors, which are likely to coexist. If the former are more substantial, there is a high probability that the symptoms will be debilitating and long-lasting, and we note that they may worsen over time or appear in a delayed manner. If the protective factors are substantial, then the child is more likely to experience mild trauma and more or less rapid healing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexually selected traits emerge typically as morphological traits that enhance reproduction by increasing the ability to compete for mates (typically through male competition) or the ability to attract females. Sexual selection thus results in a complex network of traits that enhance fighting ability, such as endurance capacity, bite force, and speed, but can also push males to their performance limit during displays to females. This chapter examines these traits and explores the limits of performance in relation to reproductive success. In addition, it examines how the diversity of sexual structures of animals can be explained through variation in performance traits.",

Así mismo se ha evidenciado el incremento de la violencia sexual en algunos hogares donde ya estaba presente antes de la pandemia.",

They are not cognitively deficient, socially isolated, or lonely, nor do they drain society's resources. They are aging well, and to the extent that they are able to engage in valued activities, they will continue to do so. A key component of adapting to growing older is the ability to maintain the sense of personal control that can be threatened by normal aging processes. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect proposes that to age successfully is to maintain physical and cognitive functioning via engagement in personally meaningful activities. Indeed, activity restriction—or the inability to continue normal activities that often follows stressful life events such as debilitating illness—is a major factor in poorer mental health outcomes. Potential contributors to activity restriction and depression are identified. Interventions to reduce activity restriction in older adults should focus on promoting manageable activities, taking into consideration individual differences in functional, psychological, and social resources.",

Even though we know that extramarital sex of many kindsmasturbation, prostitution, fornication, homoeroticism-could be allowed on a de facto basis, sexual activity outside marriage never received explicit sanction. We also know that, in marriage, forceful sexual aggression frequently received tacit permission if not outright approval. Many scholars have focused on the prohibitions or abuse; few have examined the aspirations. What was sex supposed to be about? This is a question about meaning and ideals rather than about practices and therefore becomes a cultural and intellectual question rather than a social or legal one.

      "abstract": "Twelve male subjects who were trained to expect tolerance-level electric shocks viewed an erotic film under three different counterbalanced conditions. In one condition, subjects viewed erotic film in conjunction with a signal light indicating threat of shock. A second light indicated threat of shock if subjects did not achieve an erection of a certain size. A third light indicated no shock. Both anxiety-inducing shock-threat conditions increased penile response over and above np-shock-threat condition. Furthermore, shock threat contingent on size of erection produced more arousal than noncontingent-shock threat. There is an almost universal assumption that primary maintaining factor in male sexual dysfunction is anxiety, specifically, performance anxiety or fear of performance, and modal treatments employed have as a major goal reduction of this anxiety. Masters and Johnson (1970) note a number of initial etiological pathways to erectile dysfunction, such as alcohol abuse and unfortunate, early traumatic sexual experiences; but, in regard to subsequent maintaining factors, they observe that the prevalent roadblock is one of fear. Fear can prevent erections just as fear can increase respiratory rate or lead to diarrhea or vomiting (p. 196). Unfortunately, this is an assumption without evidence in either dysfunctional or normal subjects, an assumption that goes beyond careful observations that Masters and Johnson and other clinicians have made when dealing with sexual dysfunction. The few attempts to examine relationship between anxiety and sexual arousal have been puzzling. In 1977, Hoon, Wincze, and Hoon showed 2-minute film sequences that were either neutral in content or that were designed to produce anxiety (vivid scenes of auto' accidents) to normal women, These",

Jealousy in the pre-Oedipus stage does not represent an essential rivalry, but rather a mental identification. Similar to the experience of a mirror where the child recognizes his image (mirror stage), when the young child meets someone similar, he links this to the mirror experience, in other words. When jealousy takes a pathological turn, it manifests itself in the child, when personal identification in this child still falters. It can take mytho-manic turns, but can be transitory. It can also take a paranoid turn when the ego regresses to an archaic stage where something like \"or him or me\" is played out.",

Recognition of elder abuse as a social problem and one type of family violence came after that of child and domestic abuse.

Elder abuse continues to impact the lives of older adults, especially women, 60 years and older in several ways. It is a worldwide problem that impacts the quality of life of elders in several ways.

      "abstract": "【Sexual behavior is crucial in life, yet comparatively little is known about the mechanisms in the sexual response in humans. A lot of theories and models have been developed to explain about the process of the sexual response in humans. The first model of sexual function was described by Masters and Johnson, defined the four-phase model (phases of excitation, plateau, orgasm and resolution). Helen Kaplan proposed a slightly different model of human sexual response by adding the conception of the desire phase. Some years later, a new model of circular sexual response pattern was described by Whipple and Brash-McGreer, who acknowledged the cyclic nature of women's sexual response. Basson presented an alternative model of women's normative sexual function, which featured a responsive form of desire in women's sexual response. Bancroft developed a new theoretical model, the Dual Control Model, which postulates sexual response and arousal is ultimately determined by the balance between the sexual activation or excitation system and the sexual inhibition system. The Sexual Tipping Point is a model created by Perelman, suggesting that a sexual response is determined by a balance between excitatory or inhibitory factors that may be psychological, organic, psychosocial, or cultural. A comprehensive understanding of sexual response and function is of paramount importance for the psychiatrist to study sex, offer counseling to the patient on sex, and practice sex therapy. In this literature, models of sexual response would be reviewed to understand the knowledge of the sexual functioning in humans.】",

      "title": "Consequences of impaired female sexual functioning: Individual differences and associations with sexual distress",
      "abstract": "Abstract A number of risk factors for sexual distress have been identified, including impairments in sexual function. However, for women, sexual function is only weakly associated with distress levels in many cases. One reason for this disconnect may be that impaired sexual function can have a variety of consequences for the individual's sexual experience and that some consequences may be more or less distressing to different people. Research suggests that some consequences of impaired sexual function may be more distressing to older women and/or for women in longer or less satisfying relationships. To examine the association between consequences of impaired female sexual function and distress, 75 women reporting one or more recurrent difficulties with sexual function in the past month were assessed. Frequency of sexual consequences including decreased physical pleasure, decreased sexual frequency, and negative partner emotional responses, were associated with sexual distress after controlling for the effects of sexual function. Additionally, a number of sexual consequences were rated as more distressing by older women and women in unsatisfying relationships. The idiosyncratic ways in which impairments in sexual function play out in the context of sexual activity may be an important target of future research and clinical interventions for sexual dysfunction. Keywords: sexual distresssexual functioningfemale sexual dysfunction Notes 1. This criterion may have biased the sample by excluding women who were unable to engage in sexual activity; however, the requirement was necessary given our aim of assessing the consequences of impaired sexual functioning that occurred during or immediately following sexual activity.",

Intersexuelle Menschen sind dabei nicht als eine Einheit zu betrachten; es gibt vielmehr bei Menschen, die mit unklarem Geschlecht geboren werden, eine ganze Reihe von anatomischen und geschlechtsbedingten Besonderheiten, die – teilweise noch heute – geschlechtsangleichende Operationen mit nachfolgender lebenslanger hormoneller Substitution nach sich ziehen. Es handelt sich dabei um Unterschiede im Verlauf der geschlechtlichen Entwicklung, die häufigsten Arten sind das Adrenogenitale Syndrom (AGS), Androgeninsensitivität (CAIS/PAIS) und Gonadendysgenesie. Eine Zuordnung zu Disorders of Sex Development“ wird in dem Band häufig kritisiert, weil diese eine Störung in den Vordergrund stellt, anstatt z. B. grundsätzlich eine mögliche Anerkennung eines „dritten“ Geschlechts zu favorisieren. Es wurde und wird davon ausgegangen, dass sich die Geschlechtsidentität, weiblich oder männlich, nach einer chirurgischen Angleichung und geschlechtsspezifischen Erziehung erwartungsgemäß entwickle. Dass dem nicht so ist, sondern die Eingriffe zu Leid, Irritationen, Schmerzen und sozialen Problemen geführt haben, zeigen die Ergebnisse der von Hertha Richter-Appelt und Katinka Schweizer durchgeführten Hamburger Studie zur Intersexualität, in der erstmalig für den deutschen Raum eine Befragung von intersexuellen Menschen vorgenommen wurde. In dem Buch werden neben Ergebnissen der Hamburger Studie medizinische, psychologische, psychoanalytische und rechtliche Grundlagen erörtert sowie individuelle Erfahrungen berichtet. Ziel ist es, die Diskussion auf eine breite, von mehreren Fachdisziplinen getragene Grundlage zu stellen. Dies soll zu Lösungen z.

      "abstract": "Do so-called anti-globalization movements ignore gender issues? It would be erroneous to conclude – in accordance with mainstream feminist theory that considers all social movements alone with reference to ‘male hegemony’ – that alter-globalization movements are so inscribed into the patriarchal system as to silence feminist voices. In fact, the gender problematic is not absent from the debates of the Social Forums and all principal organizations take up gender onto their agenda. The opening of the alter-globalization discourse to the gender perspective occurs out of necessity and is not the result of a process of paying lip-service to a relevant topic. We will therefore reconstruct the normative mechanism whereby gender is set on the agenda and study concretely how the relevant actors experience and effect this appropriation. In doing this they encounter other activists with a long mobilization record, both feminists and post-feminists. This encounter may give rise to processes of alliance or processes of conflict. Gender thus constitutes a challenge for alter-globalization politics and indeed often a highly contested issue.",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

      "title": "Gender in Organizations",
      "abstract": "Gender in management and organizations is an ever-present, though somewhat marginalized, topic. Unlike sex, which is linked to biology and reproduction, gender is a social category, though the two terms are closely connected, and the latter is seen as a social expression of the former. Gender is often raised in the context of persisting inequalities in labor markets and organizations. Legislation in many countries outlaws gender-based discrimination at work, yet gender equality has not so far been achieved in most organizations—in either advanced or developing economies. Various approaches drawn from psychological, sociological, and cultural theories explain the role of gender as an attribute, focusing on the unequal treatment of women in management (WIM). These approaches assume that organizational structures, including reward and beliefs systems, shape individual identities and influence micro-level behaviors in work organizations. A related trend concerns “women’s voice” literature, accounting for women’s experiences, interests, and values. In contrast, feminist thinking influenced by social constructivism theorizes inequality by proposing a conception of gendering as an outcome of relational interactions in organizational contexts. Rather than conceiving gender as a variable, such explanatory frames focus on organizing processes by which members are judged, defining their relationships with desirable organizational outcomes. Overall, feminist theory sees gender as an effect of social processes that are amenable to change. The shift from gender as an attribute possessed by individuals or practiced in organizations to gendering as an act we perform is also underscored by the recent shift toward intersectionality. These approaches and feminist postcolonial insights criticize the assumption that the term woman has a uniform meaning, irrespective of context and history. Rejecting the concept of gender identity and organizations as immutable and stable, in Gender and the Organization: Women at Work in the 21st Century (London: Routledge, 2017), Fotaki and Harding take their inspiration from Judith Butler’s post-structuralist feminist ideas. Taken together, such perspectives explain the politics of gender by offering a more nuanced and complex account of how organizations work in a global context, and they stress the power of gendered discourses and practices in reproducing gender. The latter must be constantly performed by the subjects themselves to reinforce social norms. This article addresses topics concerning WIM, and it considers gendering as a process created and reproduced by organizations. It focuses specifically on examining the causes of gender inequality in work organizations and argues the importance of feminist perspectives to better understand these issues. The article offers a selective review of the most influential books, textbooks, and articles on a range of topics relating to both WIM and gendering in organizations. It also discusses key feminist ideas that have influenced gender scholarship in management and organizations and outlines their potential for addressing persisting inequalities in organizations and society.",

      "abstract": "Newspapers, in addition to news, also cover topics of permanent interest to their readers. One such topic is sexuality. The appearance of the incurable sexually transmitted disease AIDS obliges a reconsideration of the complex and contradictory concept of sexuality. Sexuality is not often spoken of openly; rather, it is secret, hidden, and referred to obliquely. Sexuality is the manifestation and satisfaction of the sexual impulses common to all individuals. Sexuality is determined by anatomic and physiologic aspects and also by the knowledge, experiences, values, and norms internalized by the individual living in a social group. Messages about sexual conduct are constantly being received. This social part of sexuality supported by customs and morals is the part that is directly influenced by communications media. An important objective of the media is to create awareness and mold opinions. Mexico's large national circulation newspapers present different points of view about sexuality. Newspapers that continually critique homosexual practices and those that demonstrate implicit approval of pornographic videos by advertising them both present attitudes without providing opportunities to reason, compare, or support opinions. Sexuality is usually referred to indirectly and superficially in the press. Sex education may be mentioned but not the erotic implications of sexuality, and acceptance or opposition to use of condoms may be discussed without mention of psychological barriers to their use. The national press is not prepared to propose new attitudes toward sexuality in the age of AIDS. Only 1 national newspaper in Mexico regularly provides information on AIDS including aspects related to sexual pleasure and responsibility and safer sex. The majority continue with their pre-AIDS coverage of sexuality, using it to arouse interest but providing little depth. Newspapers should provide more extensive coverage on sexuality and its modifications due to AIDS, a reality threatening every person to some extent.",

However, the empirical consequences may be similar. The measurement of hypo-egoicism associated with reported mystical experiences is well established and the correlates of such experience are seldom associated with psychopathology. Likewise, that mysticism can be facilitated by appropriate set and setting circumstances and associated triggers such as isolation and chemicals suggests that hypo-egoicism is a human ability that can be facilitated among those interested in its likely positive outcomes for lives framed in terms of religion, spirituality, or both.",

      "abstract": "The experiments presented in this thesis examined the role of opioids in sexual pleasure, particularly during early formative sexual experiences, on the ability of male rats to associate an olfactory or somatosensory cue with their ejaculation-induced sexual reward state. The results show that opioids are an important substrate of the sexual reward state, and that this state feeds forward to form a conditioned ejaculatory preference (CEP), in which male rats ejaculate preferentially with females bearing or wearing the cue associated with sexual reward. This suggests that sexual reward (a presumably “proximate” cause of behavior) lies at the root of monogamous mate choice in the rat. These data also contribute to a growing body of evidence that the species’ specific sexual strategies of the male rat, often described as promiscuous, evidence a degree of plasticity that can move toward a monogamous mate choice when features of a familiar female (odor or jacket) are associated with sexual pleasure. This conditioned ejaculatory preference for familiar cues suggests that proximate pleasure-related states act as a Pavlovian US that can reinforce cue-related CSs to create partner and mate preferences. Such preferences bring proximate reward states into synch with reproductive choice, potentially enhancing reproductive success. Findings are discussed, as well as further directions.",

However, little is known about whether this experience is more or less harmful in distinct phases of the life course, consistent with the life course principle of timing; or whether, in accord with the principle of lifespan development, it has long-term implications. We draw on longitudinal data addressing perceived workplace discrimination based on race/ethnicity and gender from the prospective Youth Development Study, covering early adulthood to midlife. Hierarchical linear modelling of the effects of discrimination on depressed mood indicates that both forms of discrimination have short-term (within life stages) and long-term (across stages) adverse effects on adult mental health. The impacts of perceived discrimination within stages on depressed mood appear to be greatest in the mid-30s and to weaken by midlife. Lingering effects of discrimination are more pronounced early on. These patterns are observed with controls for key time-varying negative experiences at work and personal socio-economic status, as well as invariant background characteristics (gender, race and parental socio-economic status). We consider these findings in relation to the dynamics of personal change in the context of occupational careers.",

Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an “Unresolved” parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

Given the fact that the criminal offence of rape is characterised by a high incidence of false reports and accusations, frequently indicating specific persons as the perpetrators, certain caution is necessary in the investigation in order to avoid false accusations and/or convictions. As regards the personality of the rapist and motives for committing a forcible sexual act, certain types or rather certain categories of perpetrators can be distinguished, although it should be noted that a large number of rapists do not belong to one category only, but rather combine characteristics of several different types. During a criminal investigation it is of vital importance to differentiate between a rape as a surprise attack and a rape as abuse of trust, as they are compatible with the nature of the suspect's defence. The suspect shall be subjected to a forensic examination in the course of the investigation in order to find traces which prove vaginal, anal or oral penetration, coerced sexual intercourse and identity of the rapist. While conducting an interrogation of a suspected rapist, a crime investigating officer shall use either factual or emotional approach to his interviewee, depending on his psychological and motivational characteristics. In this regard, the factual approach is believed to be more efficient with anger rapists and sadistic rapists, whereas the compassionate approach gives good results with the gentlemen-rapists and partly with the power asserting rapists.",

      "abstract": "Past research suggests that heterosexual men show a category-specific pattern of sexual arousal, showing greater arousal to stimuli depicting women than those depicting men.Gender is not, however, the only factor affecting sexual arousal in men. Research has shown that men regard relationship context as an important factor in sexual arousal.Additionally, men show greater sexual arousal to novel than to familiar sexual stimuli. Sociosexuality, the preference for committed or uncommitted sexual relationships,affects behaviour and partner preferences. The current study investigates the relationship between sociosexuality, gender cues, relationship context cues, and sexual arousal in menby assessing 25 heterosexual men’s genital and subjective sexual arousal to 18 audio narratives describing sexual or neutral encounters with female and male strangers,friends, or long-term relationship partners. I expect that heterosexual men will show greater subjective and genital arousal in response to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a woman than to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a man, replicating previous research. I hypothesize that there will be an interaction between gender cues and relationship context, such that men will show greater sexual arousal to stimuli depicting novel female sexual partners (strangers and friends) than to stimuli depicting familiar female sexual partners (long-term partners). I predict that higher sociosexuality scores, indicating a greater preference for uncommitted sexual relationships, will correlate with greater sexual arousal to uncommitted relationship contexts (strangers or friends), whereas lower sociosexuality scores, will correspond with greater sexual arousal to the committed relationship context (long-term partner).",

      "title": "Men’s Intrasexual Competition",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in obligatory parental investment and reproductive potential cause human females to desire high-quality men as partners. For men, this means that to achieve reproductive success, they must 1) combat other men to gain access to or retain mates, and to guard the resources women need for reproduction and child care, and/or 2) attract women by displaying (sexual) ornamentations or direct provision of resources. These pressures have shaped men’s physiology, as well as mating-related and other behaviors, and result in intense male–male intrasexual competition. In this chapter, I provide an overview of men’s intrasexual competitiveness, first detailing several important concepts, before focusing on the major domains of these competitions. The research reviewed shows that physical formidability and social status are central to human male–male competition – although qualitatively different, these dimensions are intertwined, such that formidable men are more likely to excel in physical combat and competition, and as a result attain higher social status and, ultimately, increased reproductive success. Men use an array of tactics to compete with same-sex rivals, ranging from direct aggression and physical contests (e.g., in sports or fights) to (verbal) competitor derogation, and the conspicuous flaunting of possessions, leisure activities, and helping behaviors. Finally, yet importantly, research on the context-dependent fluctuations in men’s testosterone levels sheds light on the underlying processes of male intrasexual competition. Specifically, increases in testosterone are observed both in preparation for and as a result of male–male competitions, and a sharp decline in testosterone after entering in a long-term romantic relationship or during fatherhood suggest a down-regulation of these competitive tendencies.",

      "title": "Nonmammalian Psychosexual Differentiation",
      "abstract": "Nonmammalian vertebrates have traditionally played a significant role in the study of morphological sexual differentiation, but they have been relatively neglected in the study of behavioral sexual differentiation (psychosexual differentiation). Several recent developments, however, have sparked new interest in other vertebrate classes. These include the discovery of gross anatomical sexual dimorphism in songbird brains (Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976), the possibility of major species or class differences in the pattern of psychosexual differentiation (Adkins-Regan, 1981), and a generally greater tendency to view reproductive physiology and behavior as part of overall reproductive strategies to be explained within an evolutionary/ecological context. It is also becoming apparent that certain nonmammalian species are potentially very valuable as models for studying the role of hormones in brain and behavioral development, in part because they lack some problems inherent in mammals. For example, most birds, fish, and amphibians have no external copulatory organs, and so the effects of hormones administered early in life on adult copulatory behavior are not confounded by alterations in copulatory organs. In egg-laying species, there is no maternal gestation to complicate treatments given during embryonic life. Many nonmammalian species are sufficiently independent of the parents at birth or hatching so that they can be easily reared without parents; thus, a confound is avoided wherein the parents behave differently toward hormone-treated and control offspring (as has been shown to happen in rats, C. L. Moore, 1982).",

      "abstract": "Sociologists tend to define deviance in one of two ways: by the negative reactions an act, the expression of a belief, or a physical characteristic generates, or by the violation of the norms or the rules that prevail in a given society or group. Reactivist definitions come in two varieties: the “hard” or strict reactivist definition, which defines deviance as acts, beliefs, or conditions that have already attracted a negative reaction from one or more audiences, and the “soft” or moderate definition, which defines deviance as behavior, beliefs, or conditions that are likely to generate negative reactions from audiences. In contrast, the normative definition identifies deviance as a violation of a norm held in certain social circles or by a majority of the members of the society at large. A norm is a standard about “what human beings should or should not think, say, or do under given circumstances” (Blake &amp; Kingsley 1964). Put another way, a norm is a social expectation concerning thought or behavior in particular situations. Violations of norms tend to draw reactions or sanctions from their social audiences. These sanctions generate the pressure that most people feel to conform to social norms. However, even if the actor, the believer, or the possessor is not detected or chastised for a normative violation, the non‐normative act, belief, or trait is deviant nonetheless. To the normative definition, what defines something as deviance is a formal violation of the rules.",

      "abstract": "Although family should be the basis for the development and formation of a child's personality, violence is mostly done in the family, and remains undiscovered for a long time. The real number of abused children is much more than that displayed in the registered cases. The secrecy of the problem is an important feature of this phenomenon. Families in which abuse takes place are mostly isolated. Social isolation does not come about by chance; secrecy is usually encouraged by an abuser to control over famoly members. In most cases, social reaction to violence is late, inadequate and focused on the consequences, but not on the causes. \"Abuse implies an act of execution that directly inflicts damage, while neglect implies an act of non-fulfillment of something that is necessary for the well-being of a child\". The most common forms of domestic violence are physical, emotional abuse in the presence of violence against the mother, and in a lesser extent sexual abuse. In addition, there is physical, emotional, educational and medical neglect. The presence of violence against the mother and the feeling of impotence leave the same consequences as the endured violence. It is considered that children living in violent families are likely to live under cumulative stress. Traumatic responses include a wide range of conditions from acute stress reactions through post-traumatic stress disorder to complex long-lasting, repeated trauma syndrome. All children will not react to this kind of experience in the same way, with the protective and risk factors in developmental psychopathology having a significant role to play. Because of their developmental vulnerability and dependency, children are at greater risk of violence than adults. Researches point to the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention of child abuse, with greater interaction between health institutions, relevant centers for social work, police, court, government and non-governmental sector, and the existence of adequate family and criminal laws.",

Core gender identity pertains to the kind of man or woman the individual is, particularly in the sexual area. R. A. Spitz and M. Wolf reported that infants of mothers confined to institutions developed autoerotic behaviour during their first year only if they had been able to establish a tie to the mother of good enough quality, a finding corroborated by S.

      "abstract": "Environments erode health by shaping biologically based goal systems, or adaptive strivings, that help a brain regulate bodily energy resources. Adaptive strivings let predictive brain processes anticipate and meet even modest shifts in impending metabolic demands. Adaptive strivings serve growth, social potency, and safety. Striving for personal and social growth (transcendence striving) improves energy regulation and promotes health. But adverse environments can foster precarious strivings that cause organic damage even in the absence of fight-flight responses or distressing emotions: Agonistic striving (persistently seeking to influence others) and dissipated striving (disengaging to be safe) impair regulation and foster illness by generating perpetual power contests or perceptions of self-inefficacy. Threats to social power or status endanger health by inducing precarious strivings that amplify adversities. Emotional transcendence striving, however, may dampen harsh health impacts. Research has replicated the three strivings across differences of race, sex, and age and indicates that agonistic striving contributes to hypertension, somatic symptoms, and alcohol use disorders. Harmful health effects of agonistic striving are moderated by emotional transcendence striving indexed by the ability to modulate anger or physical pain. Agonistic striving mediates the association between exposure to neighborhood disorder and hypertension after controlling for negative emotions and disease-prone traits.",

What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography. Do children tell?Sometimes children tell other people, but many are threatened to stop them telling.They may receive compensatory treats or presents.",

      "abstract": "It seems that no matter where we look, stress exerts strong effects on the physiology and psychophysiology of an organism. Although beneﬁcial in the short run it is not surprising that long term stress can disturb the natural equilibrium state of an animal, given it’ s effects on the extended range of pararameters (systemic, endocrinological, cellular, molecular. The most interesting observation however was that females consistently showed an opposite or different effect than males. With regard to the question of which sex is more or less susceptible to stress, it appears this answer is thus less clear-cut than we would hope. While stress seems to affect transcriptional activity and cellular signal transduction in males, females appear more vulnerable to the negative stress effects on cell birth and/or survival. The manner in which HPA axis activity is affected in males and females is a testimony to this gender-differential regulation, since both sexes seem to indicate prolonged HPA axis overactivity, albeit in a sex-speciﬁc manner. The question we should therefore focus on is not which sex is more vulnerable, but how do the sexes differ in their vulnerabilities. It is more insight into this matter that may ultimately lead to way to new and improved drug development that considers sex speciﬁc neural circuits implicated in stress response regulation. Perhaps one day we can even speak of customized drug design, targeted to meet gender speciﬁc disturbances.",

      "title": "Role of Sexuality in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary Further evidence has been presented for the hypothesis that sexuality in the broadest sense (eroticism, menstruation, pregnancy, and motherhood) plays an important role in the occurrence of seizures in epileptic women between the menarche and the menopause. Most epileptologists have explained the seizures of epileptics by a seizure-threshold theory, which is both quantitative and nonspecific. The search for more specific factors has led some to stress the physiological aspects and others the psychological. Among the latter is the concept of the psychological conflict as cause of seizures, but often this is nonspecific with respect to the nature of the conflict and the psychological forces involved. Specific psychological theories which define the precise area of conflict have usually stressed the role of the aggressive instincts and their derivatives. Only a few epileptologists have referred to sexual conflicts, without, however, advancing any general hypothesis. The authors' experience in a three-year combined psychiatric and physiological study of more than 30 epileptic women leads to the conclusion that the nuclear conflict, the dynamic activity of which leads to seizures, is sexual. This hypothesis does not ignore the possible effects of other conflicts nor impugn the importance of aggression. Case material has been presented showing (1) that seizures occur in relationship to current sexual conflicts and to the sexual transference and (2) that past seizures occurred in relationship to past sexual conflicts, which were similar to the current ones. The material shows the concurrence of other conflicts and the importance of aggression. It shows, however, the subsidiary role these play, and the fact that aggression is mainly intelligible as either a response to the nuclear sexual conflicts or as an attempted solution of them.",

Many life style factors and occupational exposures can have substantial effects on fertility problems. Life style factors such as smoking, illicit drug (cocaine, cannabis), alcohol and caffeine consumption, exposure to extreme heat etc. have negative effects on functions of male reproductive system. In recent years, increase in disorders of male reproductive system may be associated at least some extent with these factors; which are enhanced by some of new emergent life style habits. A detailed study is required based on the data i.e., excess use of mobile phones and impact of mental stress on male reproductive health. This review highlights the role of various life style factors, environmental stresses and occupational exposures in male reproductive functions and their negative feedback in declining semen quality, increased oxidative stress as well as sperm DNA damages in male. Increase in reproductive disorder in male may be correlated at least in part with these factors, which are further added by some of new emergent life styles. Sub-fertile and/or even normal individuals have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles.",

It explains about adolescents' psychological experience of and their reactions to the bodily changes that arise during puberty. Pubertal maturation is the result of physiological developments in the individual reproductive system. The function of the hormonal system is to coordinate the activities of the various body systems. Hormones are produced in ductless glands and transported in the blood. Sex hormones are the specific hormones produced by the internal sex organs in both sexes. The pituitary gland then starts to produce sex-specific proportions of luteinizing hormones and follicle-stimulating hormones, which trigger increased growth of the ovaries in the female and the testes in the male. Pubertal status refers to the level of development reached by an individual in terms of physical changes at a given time. Pubertal status, measured in terms of bodily changes, has been found to correlate with negative moods and their intensity.",

      "title": "[Aging and sexuality in women].",
      "abstract": "A large number of biological, psycho-relational and socio-cultural factors are related to women's sexual health and they may negatively affect the entire sexual response cycle inducing significant changes in sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and satisfaction during the entire reproductive life span. In spite of the high prevalence of sexual problems with increasing age, sexual retirement is not an inevitable consequence of the passage of time and a high proportion of men and women remains sexually active well into later life, a result of changing attitudes toward sexuality and the availability of effective treatments for sexual dysfunction. Population-based studies reported an age-related decline of sexual functioning and an additional adverse effect of menopausal status. Ageing per se interferes with the level of sexual performance, but sexual behaviour of midlife and older women is highly dependent on several factors such as general physical and mental well-being, quality of relationship and life situation. Sex hormones, mainly low levels of estradiol, are relevant for the lack of sexual awareness and vaginal receptivity in naturally menopausal women. Even diminished levels of androgens, as it more frequently occurs in surgically menopausal women, has a negative impact on desire and sexual responsiveness. Several hormonal treatments have been used locally or systemically to alleviate sexual symptoms, especially by using estrogen plus androgen preparations and tibolone, with noticeable results on drive, enjoyment, lubrication, ability to reach orgasm and initiation of sex. However, sexual counseling and individualized management is mandatory to obtain meaningful and long-lasting results in clinical practice.",

In consequence, a drug-like utilization of sexuality becomes necessary to suspend feelings of violence as well as to anaesthetize, if only temporarily, a castrated image of the self, a threatened loss of ego boundaries, or feelings of inner deadness. The primary homosexual wishes of all children, in their dual version—the wish to possess the same-sex parent and the wish to be the opposite-sex parent—also demands solutions in the sexuality of the adult-to-be. The early mother–child relationship may be a decisive factor in laying the foundations for deviant sexual patterns.

This chapter explores specific ways to assess, diagnose, and intervene with Paraphilic Disorders from a systemic perspective.",

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "abstract": "Abstract Historically, the case for animals emerged within the broader context of the humanitarian movement in the nineteenth century, alongside concern for suffering children. There are strong rational grounds for seeing this connection. Peter Singer’s preference utilitarian view that only self-aware infants (aged one month or more) should be included within the moral community (i) flies in the face of this historical trajectory of concern for children and animals, (ii) fuels the popular, but misguided, view that concern for animals is misanthropy or leads to the displacement of human rights; and (iii) places in juxtaposition one of the strongest theoretical commonalities of ethical concern. Singer fails to value moral innocence (and other considerations, such as vulnerability and the inabilities to consent and comprehend) and so undercuts the case for babies and animals. The issue of animals cannot be divorced from a wider recovery of those considerations that should equally apply to vulnerable human subjects.",

      "abstract": "The welfare of animals does not invariably coincide with efficient agricultural production. Lack of welfare is the result of maladjustment of the animal to its environment. Maladjustment causing lack of welfare relates to physiology, veterinary medicine and/or ethology. Physiological and veterinary maladjustment may be, but does not necessarily have to be, associated with diminished welfare. Ethological maladjustment resulting in diminshed welfare prevents an action from being performed or being performed satisfactorily, although the animal is prompted to do so. Failure to perform an action or to perform it satisfactorily is due to: (1) absence of specific stimuli (deprivation), (2) obstruction of a particular activity (frustration), (3) absence of satisfaction when the action has been performed. Welfare is a relative concept. Profit is a matter related to welfare. Determining the relationship between welfare and profit is a scientific matter. The choice between welfare and profit is an ethical matter.",

Therefore, identifying other contextual factors influencing PA in misaligned groups is important.

      "abstract": "Using the eye gaze of others to direct one's own attention develops during the first year of life and is thought to be an important skill for learning and social communication. However, it is currently unclear whether infants differentially attend to and encode objects cued by the eye gaze of individuals within familiar groups (e.g., own race, more familiar sex) relative to unfamiliar groups (e.g., other race, less familiar sex). During gaze cueing, but prior to the presentation of objects, 10-month-olds looked longer to the eyes of own-race faces relative to 5-month-olds and relative to the eyes of other-race faces. After gaze cueing, two objects were presented alongside the face and at both ages, infants looked longer to the uncued objects for faces from the more familiar-sex and longer to cued objects for the less familiar-sex faces. Finally, during the test phase, both 5- and 10-month-old infants looked longer to uncued objects relative to cued objects but only when the objects were cued by an own-race and familiar-sex individual. Results demonstrate that infants use face eye gaze differently when the cue comes from someone within a highly experienced group.",

      "title": "Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalytic Study and Intervention Among Lesbians and Gay Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract The issue of same-gender sexual orientation became a subject of particular interest for psychoanalysis almost from the outset of Freud's study of mental life. The new scientific focus on the study of expression of gender sexual desire, including that between persons of the same gender, led to the medicalization of same gender sexual desire on humane grounds. The medicalization of sexuality has led the study of sexuality to be portrayed in medical conditions, stressing the presence or absence of a disease process (homosexual versus heterosexual). A major problem with the use of psychoanalytic theory as explication of a scientific world view, such as reflected in Freud's essay, stems from an experience distant focus on function and mechanism. There has been much confusion regarding the significance for clinical psychoanalysis of persons of the same rather than opposite gender who enjoy intimacy reflected in interpersonal attraction and sexual expression. Much of the discussion of sexual orientation within psychoanalysis has presumed necessary psychopathology founded on the assumption that, at best, same gendered sexual expression reflects psychological immaturity. Discussion of homosexuality in the psychoanalytic literature, particularly since the Second World War, has been concerned principally with concern for finding a \"cause\" for homosexuality in some aspect of early childhood. This paper argues that a proper focus of study of sexual orientation within psychoanalysis and the human sciences must attend to the meanings of lived experience as gay or straight across the course of life for the present life-story and sense of personal integrity and vitality. While the meaning of sexual orientation is always significant as a part of the psychoanalytic process, sexual orientation in itself is independent of psychopathology or present adjustment and should not be relevant as a factor in evaluating change in psychoanalysis.",

      "title": "The Child's Conception of Food: The Development of Food Rejections with Special Reference to Disgust and Contamination Sensitivity",
      "abstract": "Structured interviews with 3.5-12-year-old children and their mothers were directed at documenting the development of 4 psychological categories of food rejection. The first to appear is rejection based purely on sensory characteristics, usually taste ( distastes ). Rejection based purely on anticipated harm following ingestion appears next (danger). Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive ( disgusts ) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are \"contaminants\": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e.g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a \"contamination response.\"",

The Trobriand Islanders of Melanesia were described by Malinowski as unusually sexually permissive. Sex life may begin for young boys as early as age 10 and for young girls as early as age 6. Polynesian societies were also renowned for their high levels of sexual permissiveness. For example, among the ancient Hawaiians, “a little girl's clitoris was stretched and lengthened through oral stimulation. The penis received similar treatment so as to enhance its beauty and prepare it for sexual enjoyment later in life” (de Waal 2005: 107).",

Analyzing these interactions in immigrant adolescents who are challenged at the same time by developmental changes and modified cultural and social rules--especially if they differ from the rules assimilated during childhood--might help professionals to access better comprehension. Personal experience, individual and external resources, whether they are family oriented or professional, are prone to influence on behavior, perception and outcome related to sexual health. The subject is discussed on the base of scientific literature and medical practice.",

At least 15 per cent of women with symptoms of cystitis have no organic basis for their complaints. In psychiatric studies it has been noted that sexual conflict is the primary etiological factor in these patients. In some cases, continuance of the disorder leads to irreversible organic change. Urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, burning or retention are most common in women and become an automatic response to anxiety-provoking or sexual stimuli. In men, functional urinary symptoms are relatively infrequent. Often they indicate problems of genital dysfunction. Complaints of impotence, penile pain, testicular pain, or non-specific urethritis stem back to difficulties in their sexual lives. Many of the patients have symptoms of a generalized anxiety tension state due to sexual problems.A purely organic consideration of genitourinary disorders will lead to erroneous conclusions and unsatisfactory therapeutic results. The psychosomatic approach-that is, considering both physical and psychological aspects-will explain many hitherto difficult cases.",

Inses\r\nmerupakan masalah serius dan menjadi ancaman terhadap (terutama) anak dalam\r\nsebuah relasi atau hubungan keluarga yang mengakibatkan anak menjadi korban\r\ndari pelampiasan seks keluarganya sendiri. Inses dapat terjadi dengan ataupun\r\ntanpa paksaan, kekerasan atau ancaman kekerasan. Penegakan hukum terhadap\r\ninses juga tidah mudah dilakukan mengingat inses tersebut merupakan delik\r\naduan. Besar kemungkinan terdapat lebih banyak kasus yang belum teungkap.\r\nDalam kasus inses baik pelaku ataupun korbannya akan cenderung lebih memilih\r\nuntuk menutup- nutupinya, mengingat hal tersebut menyangkut nama baik dari\r\nkeluarga. Selain itu alasan lain mengapa kasus inses ini banyak tidak tersentuh\r\nhukum adalah karena ketakutan dari korban atas ancaman- ancaman yang\r\nbiasanya diberikan oleh pelakunya untuk tidak melaporkan hal tersebut kepada\r\npihak yang berwajib. Sehingga besar kemungkinan akan terjadi trauma yang\r\nmendalam bagi korban inses, apalagi bila inses yang terjadi pada korban\r\nmenyebabkan kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan. Dengan berbagai pertimbangan,\r\nbesar kemungkinan korban akan lebih memilih untuk melakukan aborsi terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang tidak diinginkanya tersebut. Di Indonesia, aborsi pada dasarnya\r\nmerupakan suatu perbuatan yang dilarang. Namun dalam Undang- undang\r\nKesehatan, baik Undang- undang Nomor 23 Tahun 1992 tentang Kesehatan,\r\nmaupun dalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan\r\nterdapat perkecualian atas hal tersebut. Dalam ketentuan Undang- undang Nomor\r\n36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan, aborsi hanya dapat dilakukan terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang memiliki indikasi kedaruratan medis, atau kehamilan akibat\r\nperkosaan yang dapat menyebabkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya. Meskipun\r\ndalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan tersebut tidak\r\nsecara tegas menyebutkan inses sebagai salah satu pengecualian terhadap aborsi\r\nseperti dalam Pedoman Etik Dalam Obstetri Dan Ginekologi, namun demikian\r\nInses dapat masuk pada kualifikasi perkosaan apabila hal tersebut dilakukan\r\ndengan pola disertai kekerasan ataupun ancaman kekerasan. Sehingga dengan\r\ndemikian kehamilan akibat inses yang dilakukan dengan kekerasan atau ancaman\r\nkekerasan dan mengakibatkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya, ataupun\r\nkehamilan akibat inses yang terdapat suatu indikasi kedaruratan medis\r\nterhadapnya yang mengharuskan dilakukannya aborsi dapat dijadikan sebagai\r\nsuatu legal standing terhadap pelaksanaan aborsi tersebut.",

The ovarian cycle is not unitary, but is instead the integrated product of several different components which are each affected by social signals of different modalities. This interaction between female behavior and ovarian cycle components has different manifestations in different species. Depending on its temporal context and the social and physical environment, the same behavior/hormone interaction can take different forms. In some contexts, these interactions can be adaptive for the individual. In others, they can generate a strong epiphenomenon or artifact that may not confer a direct adaptive advantage itself, but still be necessary for other aspects of the coordination between social behavior and reproduction.",

If so, what is the moral relevance of a perverted sex act? Can we apply the term 'perversion' so as to make valid moral judgements about sex acts? In this chapter, I argue against communication-based accounts of ideal or morally acceptable sex, where 'perversion' is understood as deviation therefrom. Still, I demonstrate that the term 'perversion', as it carries a negative moral, aesthetic, or attitudinal connotation, cannot be understood as a mere descriptive term.",

      "abstract": "Sex offenses to children or young adolescents have become a growing public concern. Chemical castration is currently considered as the best available societal response to child sex abuse. It abolishes testosterone secretion, its effects are reversible and side effects are minor. It has been argued that offering convicted sex offenders with the possibility to be treated may be in contradiction with the bioethics principle of autonomy because the person has really no other choice -- the alternative is usually a lengthy confinement sentence. In view of this controversy, we explored lay people’s and physicians’ views regarding the acceptability of chemical castration. Fifty participants (among them five physicians) judged the acceptability of castration in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combinations of four factors: aggressor’s age (21 vs. 41-year old); (b) victim(s)’ age (5, 8, or 14-year old); (c) aggressor’s psychiatric status (no psychiatric antecedents, suffers from sexual deviation, or recidivist); and (d) family’s attitude (hostile to any kind of castration vs. approve castration). Participants’ ratings of acceptability were, on the average, very high, and 68% of participants considered that chemical castration was fully justified in all the cases that were shown. A small minority (8%) considered that first time offenders of young adolescents, without psychiatric antecedents, should not be chemically castrated. Another minority position (24%) expressed doubts regarding chemical castration of first time offenders without antecedents but they never strongly opposed it. Implications for bioethics are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Prejudice is a broad social phenomenon and area of research, complicated by the fact that intolerance exists in internal cognitions but is manifest in symbol usage (verbal, nonverbal, mediated), law and policy, and social and organizational practice. It is based on group identification (i.e., perceiving and treating a person or people in terms of outgroup membership); but that outgroup can range from the more commonly known outgroups based on race, sex/gender, nationality, or sexual orientation to more specific intolerances of others based on political party, fan status, or membership in some perceived group such as “blonde” or “athlete.” This article begins with the link of culture to prejudice, noting specific culture-based prejudices of ethnocentrism and xenophobia. It then explores the levels at which prejudice might be manifest, finally arriving at a specific focus of prejudice—racism; however, what applies to racism may also apply to other intolerances such as sexism, heterosexism, classism, or ageism. The discussion and analysis of prejudice becomes complicated when we approach a specific topic like racism, though the tensions surrounding this phenomenon extend to other intolerances such as sexism or heterosexism. Complications include determining the influences that might lead to individual racism or an atmosphere of racism, but also include the very definition of what racism is: Is it an individual phenomenon, or does it refer to an intolerance that is supported by a dominant social structure? Because overt intolerance has become unpopular in many societies, researchers have explored how racism and sexism might be expressed in subtle terms; others investigate how racism intersects with other forms of oppression, including those based on sex/gender, sexual orientation, or colonialism; and still others consider how one might express intolerance “benevolently,” with good intentions though still based on problematic racist or sexist ideologies.",

Favorites are exposed not only to the love of a favoring parent but also to that parent's weaknesses and to the other family members' dislike. The favorite is usually guaranteed the lasting dislike of his brothers and sisters. To be a favorite is indeed a mixed blessing.",

      "abstract": "Ethical controversies in patients with intellectual disability who are sex offenders. Patients with an intellectual disability (ID) have a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains (according to the DSM-5). These deficits in adaptive functioning result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life. Therefore, it is not surprising that these patients cross physical/sexual boundaries quite often. Above that, a proportion of all sex offenders have an intellectual disability. The treatment of these sex offenders with an ID has to focus on protective factors, next to risk factors in order to decrease the risk of recidivism. Due to the chronicity of their disorder, quality of life is an important issue in these patients. In this paper, we want to address some ethical controversies: – hormonal treatment in patients with ID who are sex offenders; – the right to have a ‘normal’ sexual life in these ID offenders, and the Dutch experience of the Stichting Alternatieve Relatiebemiddeling (SAR, that can be translated as foundation of alternative relationship mediation). The SAR is an alternative dating service, giving information about the sexuality of physically or mentally disabled people and organizing sexual encounters for them.

We also revisited the importance of various positive traits in a potential partner. The participants (N = 1,017) played a date-simulation game. They chose which one of five positive characteristics, and which one of three disgust norm transgressions they want to manifest. We analysed the influence of one's biological sex, sexual orientation, and culture on self-presentation during a date. Women more often manifested morally disgusting behaviours and artistic abilities than men, while men more often manifested pathogenically disgusting behaviours and kindness. Homosexual orientation predicted lower frequency of admitting to moral disgust transgressions, and higher frequency of exhibiting artistic abilities.",

Female sexuality is a very delicate and complex process; it is a balance between psycho-emotional reactions and cyclical fluctuations in the hormonal background. With the increase in life expectancy, modern women spend a significant part of it in the period of change pause and post menopause. The menopausal period is often accompanied by a decrease in sexual activity due to a number of hormonal, psychological and physical changes: vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), urogenital changes (dryness, soreness, discomfort during intercourse, urinary incontinence), sleep disturbances, mood swings, decreased sex drive, decreased self-confidence. Often, women perceive this situation as something inevitable, something that you just need to put up with, so they rarely seek help from a doctor. Although it is obvious that sexual health greatly affects the self-esteem, quality of life, psychological and physical health of every woman. That is why, a very urgent issue in the modern world is the further study of the reasons for the decrease in sexuality in the menopausal period and the search for a solution to this problem.",

      "title": "Early-Life Effects on Adult Physical Activity: Concepts, Relevance, and Experimental Approaches",
      "abstract": "Locomotion is a defining characteristic of animal life and plays a crucial role in most behaviors. Locomotion involves physical activity, which can have far-reaching effects on physiology and neurobiology, both acutely and chronically. In human populations and in laboratory rodents, higher levels of physical activity are generally associated with positive health outcomes, although excessive exercise can have adverse consequences. Whether and how such relationships occur in wild animals is unknown. Behavioral variation among individuals arises from genetic and environmental factors and their interactions as well as from developmental programming (persistent effects of early-life environment). Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in behavior, early-life effects are not well understood. Early-life effects can in some cases persist across multiple generations following a single exposure and, in principle, may constrain or facilitate the rate of evolution at multiple levels of biological organization. Understanding the mechanisms of such transgenerational effects (e.g., exposure to stress hormones in utero, inherited epigenetic alterations) may prove crucial to explaining unexpected and/or sex-specific responses to selection as well as limits to adaptation. One area receiving increased attention is early-life effects on adult physical activity. Correlational data from epidemiological studies suggest that early-life nutritional stress can (adversely) affect adult human activity levels and associated physiological traits (e.g., body composition, metabolic health). The few existing studies of laboratory rodents demonstrate that both maternal and early-life exercise can affect adult levels of physical activity and related phenotypes. Going forward, rodents offer many opportunities for experimental studies of (multigenerational) early-life effects, including studies that use maternal exposures and cross-fostering designs.",

      "title": "FEMALE = SUBMISSIVE and MALE = ASSERTIVE Sexuality-priming leads to gender-based self-perception and automatic behavior",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is a domain in which gender stereotypes thrive. A cultural standard for the sexual experience and expression of women and men prescribes different gender roles in sexuality. Women�s sexual role is submissive and tender, men�s assertive and dominant. These sexual roles reflect the stereotypical view of women as more communal and men as more agentic. If gender stereotypes and sexual roles are activated by sexuality cues, this may have consequences for subsequent thought and behavior. Specifically, following reminders of sex, men�s and women�s self-perceptions may become more gender-stereotypical, and they may identify more strongly with their respective sexes. Moreover, research on prime-to-behavior effects has shown that priming affects a person�s momentary self-representation (the �active self�), which can lead to corresponding behavioral effects (e.g., Wheeler, DeMarree, & Petty, 2007). Thus, after sex-priming the prescriptive gender stereotypes of sexual submissiveness among women and sexual assertiveness among men may manifest themselves in participants� non-sexual social behavior. In four studies, sexuality was primed using visual (Study 1) and verbal (Study 2 through 4) material. Sex-priming led to a gender-based self-perception, i.e. women�s communal orientation was more pronounced relative to their agency, whereas for men the opposite was true (Study 1 and 4), heightened identification with one�s own gender (Study 2), and prompted greater submissiveness in women (Study 3 and 4) and greater assertiveness in men (Study 3). More specifically, in Study 3 changes in participants� signature size were unobtrusively measured after sex-priming to check for changes in assertiveness. Men�s signatures were larger following sex-priming whereas women�s were not. In Study 4 sex-primed women hesitated longer before interrupting an experimenter chatting on the telephone, thus revealing a more submissive approach to social interaction. In sum, these findings support the hypothesis that following sex-priming, self-perception and social behavior �tune in� to gender stereotypes. The potentially detrimental effects of casual �sex-priming� in everyday life on self-perceptions and mixed-sex social interactions are discussed.",

      "title": "Living with a transvestite : A phenomenological study of wives and committed partners of transvestites",
      "abstract": "Being a man or woman is at the core of human social lives and personal identity, and guides appropriate behaviours such as dress, mannerisms and relationships. Transvestism, or the practice of wearing the clothes of the other gender, challenges societal values and guidelines for behaviour. The attitude of society to this practice has varied from veneration to vilification depending on the period of history and the culture of the people. In western countries, although there is little social or legal repression, transvestism is largely a hidden phenomena. The tradition of comic drag has dominated public recognition of cross-dressing. Hence transvestites are perceived to be freakish or funny. Transvestites often marry, or form a committed heterosexual relationship without telling their partner of their cross-dressing. Because the public largely ignores the practice of transvestism, women who are married to, or form committed relationships with a transvestite are rendered invisible. The invisibility isolates women from information and social support. Although a substantial amount of literature is available regarding the nature of transvestism and the experience of transvestites, only sporadic attempts have been· made to understand the experience of, and influence on, the wives or committed partners of transvestites. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of living in a committed relationship with a transvestite from the point of view of the woman. A phenomenological approach to data collection and content analysis identified emergent themes arising from in-depth interviews with nine women who were currently living, or had in the past lived, in a committed relationship with a transvestite. The women were aged between 38 and 84, resided in Western Australia and were of English speaking background. Significantly, some participants had left the relationship. This group of women has never been accessed in previous research hence their input increases the overall knowledge of the experiences of women in relationship with a transvestite. Women described the disclosure of transvestism by their partner to be a great shock that precipitated a long period of complicated grieving. Analysis of data indicated that the relationships between their partner and the femme identity of the man and the woman, whilst unintentional on the part of the man, was experienced as emotionally and sexually abusive by the women. The women resolved the conflict in various ways. Some recommitted to a renegotiated relationship and some tolerated their partners behaviour. Most felt trapped within the relationship at some stage. The majority of women chose to leave the relationship . In retrospect, the women recognised positive changes within themselves as a result of overcoming adversity.",

      "abstract": "Money is a tool that can be wielded from the grave. It is not uncommon to find deeds or wills that shape the behavior of the living by conditioning a gift on a potential beneficiary’s conduct. Sometimes these conditions involve a limitation on marriage — prohibiting, penalizing, or requiring marriage to one of a particular religious faith or ethnicity. Courts have held that complete restraints on marriage are unreasonable, contrary to public policy, and void. However, partial restraints of marriage are valid as long as they are “reasonable.” A restraint is “unreasonable” only if a marriage permitted by the restraint is factually not likely to occur.",

They become cynical, malicious, and mean; that is to say, their libido regresses to the 'pre-genital stages of development', and sometimes expresses itself in undisguised anal and urethral eroticism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and a tendency to masturbation. The process is apparently the same as that which Sigmund Freud describes as underlying paraphrenia; in both cases there is the same abandonment of object-cathexis and the same regression to narcissism. The exaggerated dissipation of sexual interests of many people at the climacteric is a symptom of over-compensation, of the healing tendency, while the real state of the distribution of the libido is represented by the ideas of impoverishment and guilt which accompany the patient's depression.",

Individuals with ASD face unique difficulties regarding sexuality, often experiencing mismatches between sexual development and social maturity, leading to potential inappropriate behaviors. Social competence deficits may limit their understanding of sexuality, increasing risks of offending or victimization. Gender differences in sexual behavior are evident, with males showing earlier and more frequent sexual activity, while females demonstrate greater flexibility in sexual orientation. This paper presents six clinical cases highlighting the diverse experiences of sexuality and gender identity in autistic individuals, offering insights into the complex interactions between ASD, gender, and sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "The term masturbation is often not clearly defined despite its prevalent use in sex education, sex research, and clinical settings. The purpose of this study was to understand what behaviors are typically considered to be masturbation as well as the situational and individual variables that may affect the labeling of a behavior as such. An online study of 564 individuals demonstrated that a wide variety of behaviors were considered to be masturbation by a majority of participants. No difference was found between men and women in the total number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Both men and women were more likely to label a behavior as masturbation (1) if there was no sexual partner present than if there was and (2) if an orgasm occurred than if it did not. In addition, women were more likely than men to label a behavior as masturbation if they were alone and if no orgasm occurred. Younger age was associated with labeling more behaviors as masturbation, but sexual identity, self-pleasuring experience, partnered sexual experience, and attitudes toward masturbation were not related to the number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Results speak to the importance of behavioral specificity when discussing masturbation with students, clients, and in sex research.",

In this article, psychological difficulties are understood as any internal barriers, violations, failures, etc., that prevents optimal adaptation, in this case, of migrants. The focus of research by modern scientists is aimed at studying socially disadvantaged migrants and labor migrants. There is not enough research on women who have moved to a new country with their husbands. Four groups of psychological difficulties were identified that impede the successful adaptation of women, as well as the clinical manifestations associated with these difficulties: women&amp;rsquo;s expectations regarding interaction with society do not coincide with society&amp;rsquo;s expectations which contributes to the emergence of frustration and deprivation; the predominance of external motivation when moving to another country (following a husband) results in loss of work and familiar environment which often leads to depression and/or somatization; the predominance of compelled contacts in the structure of communication causes an increased irritability; self-image as a migrant before the move does not coincide with real self-image in a new country generates intrapersonal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;",

Yet, women much more intensively use various decorations (from make-up to perfume, etc.) and therefore, they look “brighter” than men. In the authors’ view, beside the genetic component this process is due to the humans’ comprehension of the relationship between coitus and pregnancy, as far as pregnancy and then the child-breeding have always entailed serious material problems. If a pregnant woman or the women already confined is left without man, this is a particularly difficult situation for her. Therefore, a woman tries to attract men by her bright outfit and decorations. Another outcome is that since the primitive communities, women have been covering up female breeding organs and some erogenous parts to avoid raping. So, on the one hand, women dress up to please men and on the other hand, cover up their bodies not to over-arouse them. The fact that the female body covering up is associated with these points (and is not exclusively the function of protection from cold, status function, etc.) is evidenced by the dynamics of their stage-by-stage public denudation in the course of civilization process.",

      "abstract": "Pain is a unique personal experience showing variability where gender and sex related effects might contribute. The mechanisms underlying the differences between women and men are currently unknown but are likely to be complex and involving interactions between biological, sociocultural and psychological aspects. In women, painful experimental stimuli are generally reported to produce a greater intensity of pain than in men. Clinical pain is often reported with higher severity and frequency, longer duration, and present in a greater number of body regions in women than in men. Women are also more likely to experience a number of painful conditions such as fibromyalgia, temporomandibular dysfunction, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome. With regard to biological factors, quantitative as well as qualitative differences in the endogenous pain inhibitory systems have been implicated, as well as an influence of gonadal hormones. Psychosocial factors like sex role beliefs, pain coping strategies, and pain related expectancies may also contribute to the differences. Being exposed to repeated painful visceral events (eg menses, labour) during life may contribute to an increased sensitivity to, and greater prevalence of, pain among women. When assessing the outcome of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in pain treatment, the factors of gender and sex should be taken into account as the response to an intervention may differ. Preferably, treatment recommendations should be based on studies using both women and men as the norm. Due to variability in results, findings from animal studies and experiments in healthy subjects should be interpreted with care.",

Meanwhile, genital manipulation and masturbatory behaviors are more prevalent among boys, suggesting behavioral differentiation by gender. Factors other than gender and age that influence sexual expression in childhood have been investigated in only a few studies. Liberal parental attitudes regarding sexuality have been found to be associated with specific behaviors such as increased masturbation, frequency of touching parents' genitals, and frequency of sexual behavior overall.",

      "title": "Sexual dysfunctions induced by stress of timed intercourse and medical treatment",
      "abstract": "Is premature ejaculation (PE) during vaginal intercourse really a male sexual dysfunction? Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘In men PE is more common than delayed ejaculation. Timed intercourse imposes a substantial degree of stress on men’. PE is a male sexual dysfunction characterised by ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within ≈1 min of vaginal penetration, and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative personal consequences 2. Sexual medicine experts consider PE only in the case of vaginal intercourse. PE is limited to heterosexual men engaging in vaginal intercourse, as there are few studies available on PE research in homosexual men or during other forms of sexual activity 2. Today PE is considered the cause of the failure to vaginal orgasm in the partner, with negative psychological consequences in males. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘The impact of impending timed intercourse on sexual dysfunction and the behaviour of male partners has only recently been investigated’. Until a few decades ago during vaginal intercourse PE did not involve discomfort in males because orgasm was not essential for female sexual satisfaction: ‘Until the mid-twentieth century, many people (including some medical authorities) believed that women were not capable of orgasm. This belief undoubtedly reflected a cultural bias: sex was seen as something the man did to the woman for his own gratification. Women were told for centuries to do their wifely duties by making themselves available to their husbands for sex’ 3. As a matter of fact the vaginal orgasm does not have any scientific basis and is a theory that was invented by Freud in 1905. The vagina does not have an anatomical structure that can cause an orgasm; a minority of women says they experience vaginal orgasm because this is the term that is explained to them by sexologists. The ‘vaginal orgasm’ that some women report is caused by the surrounding erectile organs, i.e. clitoris, vestibular bulbs and pars intermedia, labia minora, corpus spongiosum of female urethra. Distinguishing between clitoral and vaginal orgasm is not correct from a physiological view point 3, 4. The vaginal orgasm and G-spot do not exist 3-5, therefore the duration of penile–vaginal intercourse is not important for a woman's orgasm. Even today there exists only one model of physical relations: foreplay, penetration, intercourse, and ejaculation. Many men think long intercourse is the key to having orgasm during intercourse, but long intercourse is not helpful to most women. As male ejaculation does not automatically mean the end of sex for most women, touching and kissing can be continued almost indefinitely. Men think of the preliminaries as an unnecessary delay, and sexologists describe non-coital sexual activity (i.e. partner masturbation and oral sex) by the term ‘foreplay’, which implies that these acts are preliminary to intercourse, making intercourse the main event, but some people prefer other forms of sexual activity instead of coitus. Intercourse must not be the focal point of sex, ‘foreplay’ is misleading term and it must be discarded 3. Physiologically female sexual satisfaction is based on orgasm and resolution. Women with effective sexual stimulation have the physical capability of being orgasmic at all ages: clitoral stimulation is important for achieving the orgasm 3, 4. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‘Physicians and clinicians should acknowledge the potentially harmful effects of timed intercourse on the physical and mental health of men’. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge that PE is normal and it is common for any healthy adolescent man. It is important for teenagers to understand that PE is absolutely normal at this age. PE is really normal in adolescent males, especially during their first sexual encounters 3. Men with PE have no negative personal consequences during masturbation: as a matter of fact PE does not exist when the orgasm and ejaculation are obtained by masturbation. By masturbation adolescent will understand their responses and men will be able to gain better control also during intercourse. Masturbation provides a safe means of sexual experimentation, improving sexual self-confidence. In the ‘stop-start’ method the male stimulates the penis manually until him feels that he is rapidly approaching ejaculation, at which time he stops all stimulation until the sense of ejaculatory urgency disappears. Stimulation then begins again, and the stop-start cycle is repeated several times before the man is allowed to ejaculate. In the ‘squeeze’ technique the man puts his first and second fingers on the frenulum of the penis and places his thumb just below the coronal ridge on the opposite side of the penis. A firm pressure is applied for about four seconds and then abruptly released. The ‘squeeze’ technique reduces the urgency to ejaculate. It must begin at the early stages of masturbation and continue periodically, every few minutes. In the basilar squeeze the squeezing is at the base of the penis 3. PE has become the centre of a multimillion dollar business: PE during vaginal intercourse is not a male sexual dysfunction. ‘PE does not exist if both partners agree that the quality of their sexual encounters is not influenced by efforts to delay ejaculation’ and ‘Some females may be grateful to get it over with quickly’. 3. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge two specific methods called the ‘stop-start’ method and the ‘squeeze’ technique that helps recondition the ejaculatory reflex during masturbation. Non-coital sexual acts after male ejaculation can be used to produce orgasm in women. Physicians, clinicians, urologists, gynaecologists, sexologists, and sexual medicine experts should define having sex/making love, as the situation in which orgasm happens in both partners with or without vaginal intercourse: a definition for all human beings 4, 6. Sexual dysfunctions are conditions in which the ordinary physical responses of sexual function are impaired. The study of the functions of the human body must be made in the subject: questionnaires for male ejaculation and female orgasm must too assess masturbation 7.",

      "abstract": "6points out that one of the main psychosocial factors associated with depression in the Mexican population is precisely being a woman, especially when being a family head or when a woman is exclusively dedicated to housework or to take care of an ill person. Other psychosocial risk factors are related to low socioeconomic status (due to increased exposure to precarious conditions because, although there are no significant differ ences between socioeconomic strata, people from the lowest levels have more severe depression), unemployment (especially men), social isolation, legal problems, experiences of violence, substance abuse and migration. Thus, in general, it seems that women’s mental health is more vulnerable to be affected by certain social factors; however, it is also likely that men underreport mental health problems because of their difficulty to seek help if any emo tional distress afflicts them. Likewise, it has been noted that depression in men can be “hidden” behind addictive and risk behaviors as well as behind irritability and impulsivity. 7",

      "title": "Legal regulation of anti-discrimination and mobing in the field of labor",
      "abstract": "The absence of discrimination in the workplace is an important condition for productive work, mental and physical health of employees, preservation of a sense of human dignity and personality development, a healthy moral climate in the team, effective communication in production in vertical and horizontal planes and other necessary processes in the field of work, since any labor team is not only a production, but also a social environment. The negative impact of discrimination is felt far beyond the boundaries of a specific workplace, as negative emotions affect a person's family, friendships, and other social relationships. Anti-discrimination problems are the subject of research by specialists in legal, social and economic sciences, in particular, the legal protection of employees is being studied according to individual characteristics: gender, disability, HIV-positive status, migration, gender identity, ethnic or linguistic minorities, etc. There are a number of international and national regulations that prohibit unequal treatment of employees on grounds unrelated to a person's qualifications, productivity, and business qualities. Prohibition of mobbing (harassment) and establishment of responsibility for such actions became a relatively new phenomenon for national legislation. Adherence to the principle of equal treatment of employees and non-discrimination is one of the main areas of activity of the International Labor Organization, which is reflected in the norms of a number of conventions and recommendations. One of the latest is Convention No. 190 on Violence and Harassment, adopted by the ILO in 2019, which once again emphasizes the importance of creating decent working conditions for individuals on the basis of equality in the absence of any violence or harassment. In Ukrainian legislation, there are norms regarding the support of certain vulnerable groups of employees - minors, persons of pre-retirement age, internally displaced persons, persons with disabilities and others. This phenomenon is sometimes called \"positive discrimination\", which is socially determined. Discrimination and mobbing must be excluded from labor relations as those that reduce the quality of life, hinder decent work and human development, therefore the presence of clearly defined norms that establish responsibility for such actions is very important. Anti-discrimination legislation provides for disciplinary, material, financial, administrative and criminal liability for relevant offenses. Changes were made to the administrative legislation regarding the establishment of liability for mobbing (harassment) at the workplace, but there are no clearly defined norms regarding liability for violation of the prohibition of discrimination, as well as no definition of the act itself.",

In male-dominated religions, women are defined primarily as wives. In addition, male-dominated religions relate to women as daughters, especially in the sense of daughters whose virginity must be guarded over. In female-dominated religions, neither wife nor daughter is the most salient aspect of women's identity (which is not to say that women are never addressed as wives or daughters). Instead, women receive attention primarily as mothers, grandmothers, or sisters. In women's religions, childbirth is not merely a biological event, Motherhood is vested with important cultural significance, and rituals express and validate the emotional and symbolic meanings of motherhood. In many women's religions, theology and ceremony provide women with some measure of control over fertility. Motherhood—culturally constructed in various shapes—does not impact upon religiosity in a uniform manner.",

      "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive function is affected by all aspects of cancer, including cancer’s biologic processes of growth and metastasis, the effects of undergoing cancer treatment, and the psychological issues that occur as a result of having cancer and receiving treatment for it. These aspects can result in changes in body appearance, infertility and sterility, and the inability to have intercourse. The changes may be made worse by additional alterations in body image, fears of abandonment, loss of self-esteem, changes in sexual identify, and concerns about self (Krebs, 2005). Human sexuality includes three separate but intertwined aspects: body image, reproductive ability, and sexuality or sexual functioning. Body image, or the way individuals see themselves or think others see them, may be altered by changes in body appearance resulting from weight loss or gain, alopecia, mucositis, fatigue, or a variety of other changes that may not be visible to others. Changes in self-esteem may occur as a result of body image alterations, resulting in decreased desire and decreased sexual activity. Reproductive function, or the ability to bear or father children, may become impossible as a result of therapyrelated infertility, and sexual functioning may be altered by changes in self-perception, decreased desire, general side effects of treatment (including cancer therapies and methods to manage side effects of therapy), or numerous other reasons. Some individuals are at higher risk for sexual side effects than others based on age, gender, type of cancer, type of cancer treatment, or concomitant medical or psychological illness (Krebs, 2001, 2005).

These suits also raise important, but less well-probed, philosophical questions about the morality of procreation and, more generally, about the moral significance of imposed, but not consented to, conditions that deliver both significant harms and benefits.",

This assumption has prompted many investigators to study the child's symbolic labeling of significant objects in his experience, typically his parents (i, 2, 3). The present research inquired into the child's labeling of a different set of objects, those associated with school, and asked whether young children had a preference for labeling school as feminine or masculine. It is reasonable to assume that the child's sex-role classification of the school environment governs the degree of motivation he will invest in mastery of academic tasks. For the child should be more highly motivated to master tasks that he perceives as sex-appropriate than those he views as representative of the opposite sex.",

      "title": "Core and Surface Characteristics for the Description and Theory of Personality Differences and Development",
      "abstract": "Individual differences in personality are often described on the basis of a small set of dimensional core characteristics that are commonly defined as largely consistent patterns of thoughts, feelings and actions across time and situations. Some theoretical approaches even consider them to provide the biologically founded basis for individual differences in so–called surface characteristics such as self–related evaluations, social attitudes, values, goals or interests, which are commonly hypothesized to be less stable or more environmentally malleable than core characteristics. We examine these hypotheses by reviewing findings about potential core and surface characteristics on the basis of four criteria: (i) level of stability in individual differences; (ii) level of heritability; (iii) direction of causation; and (iv) shared genetic variance. The results from our review call into serious question the labelling of some sets of constructs as either core or surface characteristics of personality. Although certain dimensions—often labelled as basic traits (e.g. extraversion)—are systematically linked to more specific characteristics (e.g. social attitudes and interests), the so–called basic traits do not appear to provide an essential basis (i.e. the more stable and genetically anchored source) for these characteristics. We argue for more integrative models of personality in adulthood. Copyright © 2014 European Association of Personality Psychology",

This chapter discusses the specific discussion of sensory impairments in order to highlight areas of divergence in experience, but the reader must note that much of the discussion of sexuality and disability broadly is relevant to people with sensory impairments. Sexuality is constructed as something that is dependent on ability, vitality and conventional standards of beauty and performances of gender. Disability is constructed as something which renders one weak, dependant and tragic or childlike. As in the case of physical disability, most people with intellectual disabilities strive for, and want, 'autonomy, sex, secrets and desire in their lives'. As is apparent, research on sexuality in the context of disability is marked by a number of intersecting themes, many of which are characteristic of ongoing, seemingly intractable problems with which the field must grapple. Structural barriers are very much interlinked with the attitudinal barriers encountered by people with disabilities.",

Unequal treatment, ie putting a person at a disadvantage on the basis of some\r\n of their characteristics (eg skin color or gender) is a simplified notion of discrimination.\r\n Discriminatory treatment as a phenomenon often occurs during employment and in the\r\n workplace. The law sets out the grounds on which it is prohibited to treat a certain person\r\n unequally. One of the most common forms of discrimination is gender discrimination. The\r\n Gender Equality Act protects and promotes equality between women and men in the labor\r\n market, equal opportunities in employment, working conditions and promotion. In addition to\r\n the notion of discrimination, we have recently come across the term mobbing. Mobbing is\r\n considered a type of behavior in the workplace in which an individual or group, over a long\r\n period of time, psychologically abuses another person with the aim of endangering his dignity,\r\n integrity, reputation and honor. Unfortunately, such behavior in our legal system is not yet fully\r\n defined. As a result of exerting such pressure, a person may develop mental disorders, feelings\r\n of worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and fear, etc. In addition to completely reducing work\r\n performance, it usually puts a person in a situation where he sees no way out, and for fear of\r\n losing his job. , accept manipulation as something akin to the workplace, especially if it feeds\r\n the family. In the legislation of the Republic of Croatia, there are several sources that regulate\r\n the prohibition of discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and protection of dignity in\r\n the workplace, but the term mobbing is not accepted in these sources.",

      "abstract": "The first descriptions of the pathological desire to change your gender date back to the middle of the last century. This pathology was designated by N. Ellis as a perverse sensation of ones sex, a sexual-aesthetic inversion.&#x0D; The term \"transsexualism\" was proposed by N. Benjamin, who was the first to describe this phenomenon from a scientific point of view.&#x0D; Transsexualism - TS (eonism, sexual-aesthetic inversion, mental hermaphroditism) is a pathological state of a person, consisting in a polar divergence of the biological and civil sex, on the one hand, with the mental sex, on the other. In other words, Tc is a violation of sexual self-identification, which consists in the mismatch of the feeling of one's gender identity with the nature of the external genital organs. TS - persistent awareness of belonging to the opposite sex. The diagnosis of TS is made by adults and adolescents who have reached puberty, who wish to change their genitals and live as a representative of the other sex, after the exclusion of mental disorders. A person with TS feels like a man enclosed in a womans body, and vice versa. In a harmoniously organized body of a certain gender (the chromosomal, gonadal and morphological sex correspond to each other, providing the possibility of fertilization, and in women and childbearing) there lives an another gender soul. And this soul not only lives, it feels, thinks, suffers, experiences desires and drives that it cannot realize. In fact, we are talking about chronic stress, therefore, in most patients with TS, suicidal behavior can be detected.&#x0D; TS is a rather rare pathology. There is no data on vehicle prevalence in our country. When studying the prevalence of TS in other countries, it was noted that TS is found in many, if not all, ethnic groups, despite significant cultural differences, which can serve as indirect evidence of the biological basis of this pathology. The average age of patients with TS who go to the doctor about sex change is 20-24 years (51% of patients). This is typical for both female and male vehicles. At the age of 15-19 years, this percentage is 12, at the age of 25-29 years - 25, at the age of 30-34 years - 11, over 35 years old - no more than 1. According to the majority of authors, male TS significantly prevails over female - the ratio 3: 1.",

Availability of family and/or friends as a source of support was found to be most important for satisfactory coping. Loneliness, isolation, loss of former friendships, and ostracism by former intimate friends were some of the perceptions of the widows. Sexual problems, especially frustration, were evident among many widows. Adaptation to sexual frustration included sexual affairs with men who would not ordinarily be considered a partner, such as the married or one's physician. All widows reported that the sexual relationship was salubrious, which has implications for counselors and therapists comforting the widowed or providing death education. Each widow's individual personality and life events affected coping. Increased mental and physical ailments after the death of their spouse, especially in the first year of bereavement were reported by 15 of the 18 widows.",

The authors asked 46 teenage boys and girls (average age = 15.09 years) to indicate their preferences for various characteristics in an ideal long-term romantic or short-term sexual partner (randomly assigned). Both sexes emphasized attributes related to physical appeal (e.g., attractive physical appearance, sexy appearance) and sexual drive (e.g., sexual passion, high sex drive, sexual responsiveness) when evaluating a casual sexual partner. Conversely, participants focused more upon intellect and other mentally appealing attributes (e.g., intelligence, humor) when considering a romantic partner. No sex differences were found, suggesting that teenage boys and girls share a similar conception of the “perfect” partner.",

      "title": "“What Do You Mean by Sex?” A Qualitative Analysis of Traditional versus Evolved Meanings of Sexual Activity among Older Women and Men",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACTOlder adults remain sexually active well into later life; yet, there is no consistency in the literature about what sex means to them. The study described in this paper investigated the understanding of sexual activity as reported by 30 women and men from Poland, aged 65 to 82 (M = 71, SD = 5,24). Semi-structured interviews were thematically analyzed in relation to sexual scripts theory and the participants' specific sociocultural background. The results demonstrate the diversity of opinions on what sex is: from penetrative intercourse, through various expressions of physical intimacy, to emotional intimacy as a central concept. The dominant perception of sex as intercourse among some study participants evolved into an intimacy-oriented and partner-focused activity, with the discovery of fondling and female sexual pleasure as components of sex. Certain life events - such as ending a long-term marriage or engaging in a new romantic relationship - were identified as facilitating this change. Notable similarities in older women's and men's perceptions of satisfying sex in later life were observed. Acknowledging the nuanced meaning of sex for this population can contribute to a better understanding of the specificity of older adults' sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Significance Lower socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to increased risk of obesity. This relationship is generally assumed to be a product of low financial resources or greater stress associated with low SES that promotes unhealthy diets and lifestyles. We demonstrate here that the mere subjective experience of being lower in SES relative to others is alone sufficient to causally elicit behaviors that may risk obesity (e.g., preference, selection, and intake of greater calories), independent of actual economic deprivation or stress from being subordinated. Among social species, the physiological/psychological systems regulating hunger may have been adapted to be sensitive to perceived deprivation of critical social, material, and symbolic resources that underlie social class in addition to caloric deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Modern science begins to understand pleasure as a potential component of salutogenesis. Thereby, pleasure is described as a state or feeling of happiness and satisfaction resulting from an experience that one enjoys. We examine the neurobiological factors underlying reward processes and pleasure phenomena. Further, health implications related to pleasurable activities are analyzed. With regard to possible negative effects of pleasure, we focus on addiction and motivational toxicity. Pleasure can serve cognition, productivity and health, but simultaneously promotes addiction and other negative behaviors, i.e., motivational toxicity. It is a complex neurobiological phenomenon, relying on reward circuitry or limbic activity. These processes involve dopaminergic signaling. Moreover, endorphin and endogenous morphinergic mechanisms may play a role. Natural rewarding activities are necessary for survival and appetitive motivation, usually governing beneficial biological behaviors like eating, sex and reproduction. Social contacts can further facilitate the positive effects exerted by pleasurable experiences. However, artificial stimulants can be detrimental, since flexibility and normal control of behavior are deteriorated. Additionally, addictive drugs are capable of directly acting on reward pathways. Thus, the concrete outcome of pleasant experiences may be a question of dose. Moderate pleasurable experiences are able to enhance biological flexibility and health. Hence, pleasure can be a resistance resource or may serve salutogenesis. Natural rewards are mediated by sensory organ stimulation, thereby exhibiting a potential association with complementary medical approaches. Trust and belief can be part of a self-healing potential connected with rewarding stimuli. Further, the placebo response physiologically resembles pleasure phenomena, since both involve brain’s reward circuitry stimulation and subjective feelings of well-being. Pleasurable activities can stimulate personal growth and may help to induce healthy behavioral changes, including stress management. However, more research is needed to better understand the nature, neurobiology and maybe dangerous aspects of pleasure. Also, a possible involvement of endogenous morphinergic signaling has to be studied further.",

In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, it has become clear that the sexual abuse of children is much more prevalent than previously realized and that such abuse has extensive mental health sequelae. Females are reported victims of sexual abuse much more often than males. The peak age of onset of sexual abuse for females is prepubertal—7 or 8 years of age—and the average duration fends to be about 2 years. The basic theme of this article is that there may be directly traceable mechanistic relationships between the impact of sexual abuse on specific psychological and biological developmental processes for females and some of the adult outcomes of that abuse. Specifically, it is proposed that, to understand the long-term impact of sexual abuse, it is necessary to investigate how it may interfere with both the psychological and the biological processes of pubertal development.",

Gender-neutral terms (such as ditia relative to infants), or collective ones (such as meloct'[small change], tvarnia[stuff], blaznota[blessed bunch], and others) were used relative to infants. Indicating the uncompletedness of their status is, for example, the Russian custom of calling an infant a boy, regardless of its gender, as recorded by D. K. Zelenin.1 Specific local traditions (often quite different from one another) have established their own timetables for when it becomes necessary to give the existing\"natural\" attributes of gender the qualitatively new status of\"cultural\" attributes. Until such a transformation took place, natural gender differences had no meaning. Only with the help of special ritual operations did they acquire\"true\" significance and receive a distinctive sanctioning of their existence.",

      "title": "Can animal aggression be studied in an ethical manner?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Aggression is a behavior found almost universally in the animal kingdom. It is an unprovoked, hostile act that poses a threat to the victim. It is shown in many ways, including threatening body movements, vocalization, fighting, wounding and infliction of pain, sexual attack, and killing. Commonly, animals act aggressively to exclude others from their territory, to capture food, and to control populations. Displays of aggression are influenced by age (newborns and infants below a certain age do not fight), by the physical environment, by previous social experience, and by the aggression level in a particular community. One manifestation of aggression is infanticide-the killing of young by adults. It occurs in several species of animal. Human infanticide is practiced in several cultures to control population, to favor the birth of a particular sex, usually male, and in waging war. In nonhuman animals, infanticidal behavior has been described as a type of social pathology induced by overcrowding and by intense competition for scarce resources. Some investigators have suggested that infanticide may be a genetically influenced aspect of an animal’s “normal” behavioral repertory-an adaptive strategy in circumstances of shortage of food, for example. It could be interpreted as a normal matem’al culling of the litter under those conditions.",

As a result of this, adolescents are reaching sexual maturity earlier.

The rate of teenage sexual activity has increased steadily and consistently over the second half of the 20th century. Young people now start sexual activity at an earlier age and have more sexual partners in their life. Premarital sex no longer carries a stigma and a culture of serial monogamy is now considered by many to be the norm.",

It is a time of courtship and sociability among different social strata, a time when spirits and the devil are believed to be walking about.

Fifty male and 50 female introductory psychology studencs (M.,. = 20.2 yr.) described their actual and ideal selves on 10 specially selected semantic differential scales. Analyses of variance on each scale yielded a significant (9 < .05) main effect of se!f-description.

For both actual and ideal selves men described themselves as mote rational than did the women. There was a significant effect of sex and an inreraction of self-description by sex for the dimension of dominating-submissive.

      "abstract": "Encarnar una masculinidad hegemónica engloba todos estos protocolos, conductas y actitudes que responden al problema de la legitimidad del patriarcado, es decir, conlleva una serie de prácticas que justifican una estructura de dominación de un género sobre el otro. Hay un arquetipo masculino que se espera de los hombres, en el que deben seguir una serie de mandatos como mostrarse fuertes, impulsivos, violentos, incluyendo también una serie de prohibiciones como la expresión de emociones que muestren debilidad. Sin embargo, hay excepciones dentro de los espacios exclusivamente masculinos donde esta ley hegemónica no se cumple al pie de la letra, eventos que se nombran en este ensayo como hipocresía sintomática masculina. Sin importar de que estas excepciones a la ley hegemónica de la masculinidad sean un acto hipócrita o no, nos muestran una serie de carencias producto de encarnar este arquetipo de hombre, que la ley masculina además no permite otra forma de satisfacer. De este mismo modo, nos invita a pensar en formas de masculinidad más allá de la hegemónica, que no se construyan desde la violencia y el malestar.",

Individuals engage in physical activity during leisure-time and also during in many other activities such as walking to work, home maintenance, shopping and child care. Physical activity also occurs on the job is this is referred to as work physical activity. Prior studies have shown that non-work physical activity has a positive impact on health while work physical activity has a negative impact on health. Many prior studies have relied primarily on leisure-time physical activity, which typically constitutes only about 10% of non-work physical activity and does not capture specific information on the intensity or duration of the activity. This study addresses these limitations by constructing measures of physical activity from the American Time Use Surveys, which are all-inclusive and capture the duration of each activity combined with its intensity based on the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). Non-work physical activity tends to be significantly lower for Blacks, Hispanics, other racial groups than for Whites and lower for males than for females. These adjusted differentials are consistent with racial, ethnic and gender differentials in health. About 25-46% of the differentials in non-work physical activity can be attributed to differences in education, socio-economic status, proxies for time constraints, and locational attributes.",

      "abstract": "Gender identity disorder of childhood refers to a rather rare disorders, but according to the literature girls with the disorder in the future may become homosexual or transsexual. The necessary diagnostic criterion for gender identity disorder of childhood is the presence of a constant desire to belong (or the conviction of belonging) to the opposite sex, coupled with a strong denial of the behavior, characteristics and/or clothing specific to the registered sex. Usually the disorder is manifested in the preschool years, but for diagnosing it is necessary that it manifests before the onset of puberty. Both sexes may have a rejection of anatomical structures inherent in his own sex; however, such unusual display is rare. Patient V. came to the appointment with psychiatrist with parents 3 years ago. During the interview reported that she starts to feel the boy at the age of 9 years. This announcement provoked outrage from parents. With the beginning of the critical days began to position herself in a male person. The patient met all diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder of childhood. The patient underwent a course of systemic therapy combined with nootropics. Currently, patient name is the name of a female, the patient wears women's clothing, identifies herself as a woman. The patient continues to meet with a psychotherapist, is satisfied with the treatment, thoughts on sex change does not express. Thus, in the case of diagnosis of this disorder can become effective systemic therapy in combination with nootropics.

However, a good deal of sex differences in health issues have their origins in the genes on the sex chromosomes themselves and in X inactivation-the developmental program that equalizes their expression in males and females. Most females are mosaics, having a mixture of cells expressing either their mother's or father's X-linked genes. Often, cell mosaicism is advantageous, ameliorating the deleterious effects of X-linked mutations and contributing to physiological diversity. As a consequence, most X-linked mutations produce male-only diseases. Yet, in some cases the dynamic interactions between cells in mosaic females lead to female-specific disease manifestations.",

There are no well-established or exhaustive explanations for the development of gender identity disorder. Gender identity appears to be established and influenced by psychosocial factors during the first few years of life. However, many authors have argued for biological factors, if not causative, may predispose an individual to a gender identity disorder. Because most gender dysphoric individuals have adamant requests for sex reassignment (many often already taking opposite-sex hormones supplied by other physicians), it is extremely difficult to engage the patients in treatment with anything other than surgical reassignment as the goal. However, because surgery is irreversible, it is important to engage these patients in psychotherapy, even if surgery is indicated. The therapist should be careful to base the goals of therapy on what is desired by the patient. Behavior therapy has been used to modify specific cross-gender behaviors of child with gender identity disorder.",

      "abstract": "Female genital mutilation has been condemned far more than male genital mutilation. There seems to be a conspiracy in the scientific community to ignore the benefits of the intact prepuce (foreskin) and to deny the horrors of male genital mutilation. Science and human rights must always trump and triumph over superstition. The prepuce is on the penis for a purpose. The foreskin/prepuce is not something to be jettisoned like the umbilical cord. When the umbilical cord is severed neither baby nor mother feel any pain. Why? Because there are no nerves in the umbilical cord. Ditto when fingernails or hair is cut. Is this the case when an infant male is mutilated/circumcised? Not at all. Male circumcision in both infant and adult males produces pain lasting from hours to days. This is because the foreskin/ prepuce is innervated. The prepuce has somatosensory nerves linked to the oral nerve of the penis and branching into the scrotum. Not to mention autonomic nerves from the pelvic plexus. The prepuce protects the glans penis and urinary meatus. The foreskin contains Meissner corpuscles and natural lubricants. The bottom line is that the prepuce/foreskin is a fully fledged and essential body part-not an appendage to be excised. Nor is it temporary or transitory like milk teeth. The prepuce has a purpose. It lowers penis temperature, increases penis girth, protects the penis from chaffing and increases comfort and pleasure during coitus. And who knows which other functions of the foreskin scientists might discover in the future?",

      "title": "COMBINED EFFECTS OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HAZARDS",
      "abstract": "There has been previous research on a large number of workplace hazards. There are two types: these are generally considered as ‘white-collar’ stressors (i.e. those arising from the psychosocial environment, that is the interaction between the psychology of the individual and the social environment of work) and ‘blue-collar’ stressors (i.e. those due to exposure to stressors of a physical nature such as noise or fumes or potentially deleterious organisation of the hours of work such as night-, shift-work or excessively long hours). For the most part the nature and effects of such stressors have been considered in isolation. Such an approach is not likely to be representative of the real-life situation where employees are often exposed to multiple hazards (i.e. both white-collar and blue-collar stressors). For example, individuals are very unlikely to work in a noisy environment that does not also expose them to other stressors that have considerable potential to harm. There is limited information on the combined effects of these hazards on health and performance efficiency. Indeed, there has not even been any systematic reviews of the existing literature; no attempt to produce a coherent framework for studying these factors has been offered and a dearth of studies using multi-methods to investigate the topic have been undertaken. This investigation aims to redress these issues. The information currently available on combined effects will be reviewed; following this a variety of methods will be used to investigate the combined effects of occupational health hazards. Achievement of these two objectives is an essential first requirement for the advancement of this area of research.",

In fact, estimates from various wars over the past 70 years suggest that noncombatants comprise the majority of casualties. For survivors, war's effects are often embodied, leaving long-term effects on health and biology. Some of these effects, such as injuries and psychological trauma, are well known. Yet other effects may be subtle and may be elucidated by a developmental biological perspective. In early life, when growth rates are highest, conditions of war may have their greatest impact. Depending on local circumstances, a developing embryo, infant, or child growing in a place embroiled in armed conflict is likely to face—directly or indirectly—various stressors, including malnutrition, infectious disease, and/or psychological stress. Thus, the conditions of war and forced displacement may become embodied, getting under the skin for fundamental biological reasons.",

In this way, our gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender) and sexual orientation are programmed or organized into our brain structures when we are still in the womb. However, since sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place in the first two months of pregnancy and sexual differentiation of the brain starts in the second half of pregnancy, these two processes can be influenced independently, which may result in extreme cases in trans-sexuality. This also means that in the event of ambiguous sex at birth, the degree of masculinization of the genitals may not reflect the degree of masculinization of the brain. There is no indication that social environment after birth has an effect on gender identity or sexual orientation.",

      "abstract": "The term sexual minority youth (SMY) encompasses youth who are not exclusively heterosexual. These are youth whose sexual orientations, identities, and/or behaviors are not exclusively heterosexual. Sexual identity is one’s personal identity as a sexual being, a label used in regard to oneself, such as “gay,” “lesbian,” “queer,” “pansexual,” or “asexual.”1 Sexual identity may not be indicative of sexual behaviors and, thus, understanding both identity and behavior are essential to providing excellent care— particularly as SMY youth often face health disparities.2 SMY youth, like their heterosexual peers, have strengths and vulnerabilities. Although the majority of sexual minority children and adolescents do well, they are likely to experience mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidality at higher rates than their heteronormative peers.1,3 This phenomenon may be due to stigma, microaggressions, victimization, and/or discrimination regarding their sexual identities, which in turn effects overall health.4 In a 2013 survey performed by the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, 55% of sexual and gender minority youth surveyed stated that they felt unsafe at school due to perceived/experienced harassment from peers.5 This harassment can lead to an increase in suicidal ideation and attempts6 due to internalized shame and stigma, social isolation, and conflict about their identities. Microaggressions, stigma, and shame may also be experienced at home and in the community. Healthcare providers are in a unique position to support minority youth across multiple domains if they are aware and informed of social supports and experiences of conflict.",

These scenes typically involve both a bearded and unbearded male figure with a nude female between them, suggesting that sex with a prostitute or flute girl could be a social activity enjoyed together by erastēs and erōmenos. These scenes should not be interpreted as satirical depictions of debauchery and excess, but as titillating conversation pieces inviting the viewers’ hermeneutics. Whether sexual pedagogy or unabashed hedonism, the common thread through all the representations we study here is the centrality of masculine spectatorship and performance to the erotic imagination of a culture familiar with athletic display of nude bodies.

Intimate relationships are an important and normative part of adolescent development, and are vital for adolescents' well‐being. Stages of sexual development include the start of pubertal development and sexual behaviors such as petting and kissing. For many adolescents, these “light” sexual behaviors transition into sexual intercourse. Conflict or violence in intimate relationships, as well as nonlinear trajectories of sexual development, may have a negative impact on adolescents' mental health and well‐being.",

Although ED can exist for only psychogenic reasons, organic ED is almost always associated with some degree of psychogenic dysfunction; thus, nonpsychogenic ED is actually mixed. In the past, when the principal treatment for ED was penile prosthesis implantation, the distinction between psychogenic and organic or mixed ED was of considerable importance. Since many of today's treatment options are nonsurgical, this distinction is less critical. For men who are contemplating surgical treatment, such as penile prosthesis implantation, however, it is still desirable to exclude temporary or potentially reversible forms of erectile impairment, such as psychogenic ED. Erectile dysfunction must also be distinguished from other sexual disorders, such as decreased libido, premature or retarded ejaculation, painful erections or orgasm, and erectile deformity. Of course, any of these disorders may coexist.",

      "abstract": "Sexology is a broad, interdisciplinary, field with a long tradition of empirical research.Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies have been conducted since the 20th century, providing abounding evidence.As the area is informed by diverse theoretical backgrounds, a wide range of methods have been applied to sex research over time.While the World Health Organization 1 claims that sexual health refers to a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in relation to sexuality, beyond the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity, most studies from the past decades have focused on sexual function and behavior.Broader aspects such as quality of sex life, sexual violence, sexual beliefs, and sexual satisfaction have received less attention.The narrowing of sexuality around sexual function might be misleading in the understanding of the sexual complaints that make a person seek for sexual healthcare.The inclusion of broader aspects might foster a more comprehensive perspective and produce more effective, culturally competent, treatment options.From Masters' and Johnson's observations in the 1960s until today, most of the knowledge available on sexual function and the psychophysiological processes involved in sexual response was derived from experiments that may seem exotic to a naïve observer.Unconventional instruments are used to measure participants' genital responses, like vaginal and penile plethysmographs or genital thermographs, and experimental tasks may include masturbating in the lab or watching a pornographic video, while monitored by eye-trackers, electroencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging.Clinical trials on sexual medicine interventions have also risen in the last 30 years, driven mostly by efforts to develop medications for sexual disfunctions.Ethical guidelines limit the number of sexual behaviors that can be observed or experimentally manipulated in laboratory settings.Generalizability of these findings may additionally be biased by the artificial context and observer effects.Thus, for the study of sexual behavior, indirect observation is broadly used, with methods that include interviews, self-report questionnaires or retrieval of clinical records and public databases.Cross-sectional surveys are the most used alternative for obtaining information about sexual behavior and other dimensions of human sexuality.Robust estimates of the prevalence of sexual behaviors and their determinants in the population have been provided by surveys in the past years.Research strategies to minimize measurement error have been applied, from sample selection to questionnaire content, design, and data collection 2 .Random probability sampling methods are used to reduce volunteer bias.Volunteers in sex research tend to be more sexually experienced, sensation seeking, to have more relaxed sexual attitudes and behaviors than the general population.Achieving good response rates is thus essential to improve the representativeness of the survey and reduce participation bias.Nevertheless, recall and comprehension problems, as well as respondents' ambivalence to report socially sensitive information are still a challenge in these studies.Long questionnaires may also decrease data quality, due to missing data and inconsistent answers.To minimize that, sex researchers sometimes alternatively rely on methods like diary studies, which may require participants to self-monitor some aspects of their sexuality or relationships every day, for a period.",

      "abstract": "Genetic disorders traditionally fall into three main categories: single-gene defects, chromosomal abnormalities, and multifactorial conditions. A chromosomal abnormality, or chromosomal aberration, is a disorder characterized by a morphological or numerical alteration in single or multiple chromosomes, affecting autosomes, sex chromosomes, or both. The normal human karyotype contains approximately two meters of DNA organized into 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes and a set of sex chromosomes that compromise two X chromosomes in females or an X and a Y chromosome in males. All the genetic necessary for growth and development derive from chromosomes (around 20 to 25 thousand genes). Chromosome abnormalities usually involve an error in cell division (mitosis or meiosis), which may occur in the prenatal, postnatal, or preimplantation periods. These alterations have significant clinical consequences, i.e., spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, neonatal death/hospitalization, malformations, intellectual disability, or an identifiable syndrome. Accurate identification of these chromosomal errors is essential for prevention strategies, genetic counseling, and appropriate treatment.",

These risks remain true regardless if the victim is directly or indirectly targeted (as a witness) during the violent episodes. However, these risks are also modulated and moderated by a series of variables, such as the parental emotional and social support, the family’s structural integrity and cohesion and victim’s age and sex.",

      "title": "Paternal Behavior from a Neuroendocrine Perspective",
      "abstract": "How hormones and neuromodulators initiate and maintain paternal care is important for understanding the evolution of paternal care and the plasticity of the social brain. The focus here is on mammalian paternal behavior in rodents, non-human primates and humans. Only 5% of mammalian species express paternal care, and many of those species likely evolved the behavior convergently. This means that there is a high degree of variability in how hormones and neuromodulators shape paternal care across species. Important factors to consider include social experience (alloparental care, mating, pair bonding, raising a previous litter), types of care expressed (offspring protection, providing and sharing food, socio-cognitive development), and timing of hormonal changes (after mating, during gestation, after contact with offspring). The presence or absence of infanticide towards offspring prior to mating may also be a contributor, especially in rodents. Taking these important factors into account, we have found some general trends across species. (1) Testosterone and progesterone tend to be negatively correlated with paternal care but promote offspring defense in some species. The most evidence for a positive association between paternal care and testosterone have appeared in rodents. (2) Prolactin, oxytocin, corticosterone, and cortisol tend to be positively correlated. (3) Estradiol and vasopressin are likely nuclei specific—with some areas having a positive correlation with paternal care and others having a negative association. Some mechanisms appear to be coopted from females and others appear to have evolved independently. Overall, the neuroendocrine system seems especially important for mediating environmental influences on paternal behavior.",

The basic questions here are: do changes occur in sexual behaviour, sexual interest or responsiveness during the climacteric years? If so, what are the variations and how are they caused? Two variables used extensively as a measure of sexuality are coital frequency and orgasmic frequency. Kinsey et al. (1953) showed that the degree of sexual activity remained fairly constant in unmarried women up to 55 years of age. By contrast, sexual activity in unmarried men declined gradually from puberty onwards. For married men and women they found that the frequency of sexual outlets declined during the life span. Kinsey et al. emphasized that the decreasing frequency of sexual intercourse and orgasm in marriage does not prove that the sexual capacity of the woman is influenced by her own ageing but could instead be a result of her husband's ageing. These authors were of the opinion that there is little evidence of any ageing in the sexual capacity of the female until late in her life.",

      "abstract": "Discrimination refers to an act, policy, practice, or social structure that creates, maintains, or reinforces an advantage for some groups and their members over other groups and their members. Discrimination, which can occur at the individual, institutional, and cultural levels, represents unfair treatment and can be distinguished from two other forms of bias: (i) prejudice, which is an attitude reflecting an overall evaluation of a group, and (ii) stereotypes, which are associations and attributions of specific characteristics to a group. Although prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination at the individual level are generally positively associated empirically, prejudice and stereotypes do not necessarily lead to discrimination, and discrimination can occur in the absence of conscious prejudice and stereotypes. Classic contributions on this topic characterized discrimination mainly in terms of negative actions by individuals—ranging from verbal comments to physical injury—directed to harm of another group and its members. However, in addition to blatant and direct forms of discrimination, discrimination may be displayed as unjustified positive treatment of members of one’s own group relative to members of another group, or it may represent actions toward members of another group that initially appear favorable but ultimately disadvantage the other group in the longer term (e.g., patronizing behavior, such as chivalry). Discrimination is often represented in terms of the behavior of individuals directed toward members, but these acts are not necessarily consciously motivated. Moreover, individual bias expressed by individuals is not necessary for discrimination to be experienced by members of some groups. Instead, discrimination may be enacted broadly through institutional structures and policies or embedded in cultural beliefs and representations that value various groups differently. Thus, individual-, institutional-, and cultural-level processes may operate in concert to provide some groups systematic advantages and/or to impose disadvantages on other groups. Often these influences are cloaked in justifications or ideologies that obscure the unfairness of the influences and thus allow the discriminatory nature of the treatment to go undetected and unaddressed. The remainder of this examination of discrimination considers (i) personality and individual differences related to behaving in a discriminatory way, (ii) social psychological influences that promote discrimination, (iii) subtle manifestations of discrimination, (iv) institutional and cultural forms of bias; (v) the impact of discrimination psychologically and physically, and (vi) ways of combating discrimination.",

Sexuality, the expression of interest, orientation, and preference, is a normal part of adolescence. Adolescent sexuality encompasses multiple factors, such as developing intimate partnerships, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and culture. Adolescent sexuality has changed over the past 50 years, with adolescents now reaching physical maturity earlier and marrying later. Puberty marks the obvious physical development in early to middle adolescence and is seen as the time for potential onset of sexual thoughts and experimentation. Mostly, legislation does not explicitly criminalize consensual sexual conduct between adolescents, and this leaves a gray area to be filled in by social and cultural norms that perceive adolescent sexual conduct negatively. Most state concentrate more on penalty than on initiatives to tackle the structural background of sexual inter course-related harms. Focusing on increasing access to youth friendly services that respect adolescents’ rights to health services and privacy will be important to ensure that adolescents seek and receive these services.",

Such practice is contrary to recommendations in the 2006 Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders. When psychological preparation is lacking for aspects of DSD such as uncertainty about future gender identity, a false sense of urgency can propel parents to agree to genital surgery or removal of gonads without adequate understanding of the long-term consequences in adulthood. If physicians are uncomfortable discussing gender and sexual issues, they may not explore the feasibility of, or offer support for, alternative approaches towards sex atypicality. Families may draw unrealistic conclusions regarding the extent to which such interventions will relieve their distress and improve quality of life for the child and family. Failing to offer adequate psychosocial support to parents making irreversible decisions about DSD can raise significant ethical and legal concerns. Families may experience regret and anger when they make decisions on the basis of limited or even biased information while in an emotionally vulnerable state. Children's autonomy is violated when they are completely excluded from decision-making. We propose adoption of a holistic approach to emotionally and cognitively informed consent in this setting, with inclusion of psychosocial and peer support from the earliest stages.",

      "abstract": "In addition to reflecting gender‐targeted media content, men's and women's media habits may reflect a host of complex motivations and consequences, in step with larger cultural norms regarding gender roles. For example, men's greater interest in violent and/or sexually explicit media content may reflect gendered socialization practices that inhibit women from seeking out such traditionally male‐dominated genres, as well as sexist or sexually objectifying content that may decrease women's interest in such genres. In some domains, such as social media use, gender differences are not as notable, although women are more likely to use platforms such as Facebook, and engage in photo‐based behavior than men. Work on intersectional identities (intersections between gender and race, gender and sexuality, etc.) and media use focuses on navigation of stereotypic content, although some research has documented the benefit of new media (Internet and user‐generated content) for sexual and gender minorities in particular.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual addiction has been an increasingly observed and researched phenomenon within the past 30 years. “Classic” sexual addiction emerges from a history of abuse, insecure attachment patterns, and disordered impulse control, often presenting with cross addictions and comorbid mood disorders. In contrast, a “contemporary” form of rapid-onset sexual addiction has emerged with the explosive growth of Internet technology and is distinguished by “3Cs”: chronicity, content, and culture. Of particular concern is early exposure to graphic sexual material that disrupts normal neurochemical, sexual, and social development in youth. Treatment modalities for “classic” and “contemporary” forms are overlapping yet distinct, reflecting their unique etiologies and similar presentations.",

Relationships play a major role in the lives of each individual irrespective of gender, age and other significant demographic factors. Obsession with relationships may occur with friends, peers, opposite gender, or anybody whose significance is more to the person concerned. When such obsession occurs, the person tends to get engrossed and lost either in the joy or the sorrow of the relationship. It mostly occurs among people in relevant or irrelevant relationships, who tend to live or not live together, who may have in-secured thoughts about the partner, and for several reasons not restricted to the mentioned.

Seks bebas (free sex), hamil di luar nikah, aborsi, perkosaan, pelecehan seksual, peredaran VCD porno, pornografi, dan pornoaksi merajalela di kalangan remaja saat ini. Hal ini pada satu sisi dapat merisaukan public pada umumnya, misalnya merisaukan lingkungan masyarakat, dunia pendidikan keluarga, sekolah bahkan pendidikan di gereja. Akan tetapi pada aspek lain terdapat orang-orang yang memiliki dorongan yang berangkat dari hati nuraninya sehingga memiliki kepedulian dan keberpihakan terhadap para remaja yang melakukan hubungan free sex. Tipikal yang demikian memiliki inisiatif sendiri untuk menolong orang-orang yang mengalami dan khususnya bagi remaja. Biasanya perihal yang dilakukan adalah berinisiasi untuk mengumpulkan mereka dan menyampaikan materi-materi yang berkaitan dengan free sex agar mengurangi lajunya pergerakan yang semakin dinamis dalam realiata yang ada.&#x0D; Pada umumnya Etika Kristen tidak membenarkan tentang hubungan seks bebas atau free sex, baik yang dilakukan oleh oknum-oknum yang berkeluarga, orang dewasa dalam hal ini yang belum menikah, ataupun oleh pemuda-pemudi bahkan remaja-remaja. Upaya Kristen dalam menangani kasus-kasus yang terjadi pada remaja tentu mengacu pada beberapa pola yang sesuai standar Alkitab. Pola-pola yang penulis maksudkan adalah upaya melalui tinjauan Alkitab tentang seksualitas, melalui pendidikan gereja, melalui pendidikan keluarga, sekolah, melalui pendekatan kontribusi terhadap budaya, masyarakat, dan melalui kontribusi terhadap pemerintah setempat. Supaya elemen-elemen tersebut saling interdepedensi dalam mengatasi free sex yang belakangan ini marak terjadi di kalangan para remaja di Indonesia. Metode yang digunakan dalam kajian jurnal ini adalah metode deskiptif dengan pendekatan literatur dan fakta data sesuai yang berkorelasi dengan judul utama dan sub-sub judul.

Besides, It not always considers this, to be mental health or to represent an expression of whole health. Such ambivalence towards sex and the sexual is located between the limits of the sacred and erotic, both associated to taboos and their transgression. Since the last century, the current \"neosexual\" revolution intents to dismantle old patterns in favor of the dissociation of human sexual sphere, the dispersion of sexual fragments towards individualism and intimate relationships diversification. Within such context, \"addiction\" to sex and the sexual, as a compulsive conduct, represents on one side a clinical reality each time better observed and diagnosed, where the importance of family history is recognized, as well as individual psychopathology, and marital life, in its etiology and also for its treatment and prevention. On the other hand, it has not been classified in the mental health catalogues as it is not considered, meanwhile, as the problem is been maintained, the co-morbidity and its consequences multiply, and the controversy continues.",

      "title": "Factores psicológicos y socioculturales en la vida sexual de los adultos mayores",
      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempena un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, asi que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el interes o las practicas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino tambien de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfaccion de una necesidad fisiologica basica, denominada como “normal” en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona mas a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicologicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepcion de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utilizo el metodo descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificacion, test bienestar psicologico y la satisfaccion sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tardia, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, version para adultos. El analisis de datos se realizo mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de calculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad. En los resultados se encontro que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicologico, no intervino en su percepcion de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayoria de la poblacion manifesto tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influyo de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se pregunto a los adultos mayores en estudio: ?cree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contesto en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les pregunto si en la actualidad mantenian relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres si tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetracion o coito para obtener satisfaccion sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetracion para obtener satisfaccion sexual. En conclusion, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual estan inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atencion suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayoria de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas mas jovenes.",

      "title": "Non-normative Sexuality Studies",
      "abstract": "Sexual non-normativity in the early-21st-century social sciences not only describes the cultural, social, and political needs, interests, experiences, and struggles of nonheterosexual desires and representations, but it also includes an array of identity formations. What does it mean to be “non-normative”? Ideally speaking, this connotation structures around a political claiming, a subversive metaphor that does not adhere to the standard gender(ed) expressions. That said, these gender traits challenge the cultural norms, or the dominant languages as historically coined within the medical dictionary. In order to address this, the politics further renders a non-foundationalist approach to gender, as making an attempt to de-objectify any sort of typification of classification. In addition, the diversity and fluidity of it aims to install de-pathologization of identity category, and further, to pacify the rigid gender traits that could potentially make gender more discrete. Thus, its very fluidity establishes an unsettling position of gender and sexual choices, as further to establish anti-imperial, non-hegemonic claim in the US-centric gender positions and theorizations. In lines to this argument, non-normative sexuality studies are an attempt to collate interdisciplinary and non–Euro-American modes of texts, theories, and approaches from the domains of culture, desire, beauty, aging, legalities, medicine, and health, complemented with several dimensions of these disciplines to create a bibliographical space addressing the several bodies, identities, and experiences of these representations. Furthermore, it maps the various changes in the lives, personal experiences, forms of discrimination faced in the past or present, needs, interests, and perspectives of these individuals in varied geopolitics, contexts, and cultures—modeling approaches that might be seen as alternatives to the dominant queer studies.

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory IV. Theory on Child Development",
      "abstract": "We can identify five important needs that children have: the need for acknowledgment, acceptance, awareness or attention, respect, and care. If these needs are not met, children will modify themselves by denying central parts of their nature in order to adjust to their parents and the situation at large. When a child denies his or her talents, powers, and gender or aspects thereof, he or she loses quality of life, the ability to function, and physical or mental health. The loss of ability takes the form of diminished social ability, psychosexual potency, joy, energy, and fantasy while playing, as well as diminished ability to concentrate, focus, and learn. Many modifications result in a child with severely damaged self-confidence, self-worth, and poor performance. A child more or less deprived of self-worth cannot enjoy, give, or receive. A child deprived of emotions turns cold, rational, asocial, socially stiff, uncomfortable, and in the extreme case ... intentionally “evil”. When a child denies his or her own sex, it becomes invisible, uninteresting, and vague or becomes like the opposite sex in behavior and appearance. The general holistic solution to the vast diversity of symptoms in children with low quality of life is to improve the situation for the child and give the child the holding and support he or she needs. It is very important to realize that a negative belief often has survival value to the child as it helps the child to avoid taking responsibility for problems, which really belong to the parents or other adults. Children have a fine capability for spontaneous healing, and seem to enter this process more easily than adults, given sufficient holding. The symptoms of children with poor thriving ability are often difficult to understand, as they are caused by a complex combination of self-modification in five existential dimensions. This often leads to complex medical diagnosis, giving the idea that the child is sick and without therapeutic reach, while sufficient holding could solve the problem. If holding and support of the child is not enough, the situation must be carefully analyzed to find other possible causes of poor quality of life, health, and functional ability. Education of the parent in holding is often mandatory. Most children with bad thriving ability can thus be helped by simple means.",

Para ambos grupos, el consumo alcanzaba un tope de saturación como fue el caso con anterioridad para los hombres adultos. En treinta años, la indumentaria evolucionó mucho. Se compran menos « prendas de abrigo » tales como abrigos, trajes de chaqueta o trajes para hombre. Por el contrario, las prendas deportivas y los conjuntos de decontracción se van extendiendo. Las mujeres han adoptado cantidad de prendas masculinas sin que por ello hayan renunciado a arti- culos tradicionales. Esta evolución general no trae la desaparición de las diferencias entre categorias sociales. Por lo contrario, ya no se suele encontrar en la indumentaria tendencia a uniformización de las prácticas de consumo. Nuevos productos o importados del exterior no se van extendiendo sistematicamente de las categorias acomodadas a las demás categorias sociales.

      "title": "General Introduction to Animal Models of Human Conditions",
      "abstract": "Animal models serve to imitate (patho) physiological states and/or phenotypical characteristics known to occur in target species (usually man but sometimes other species as well). The use of animal models has had and may continue to have a tremendous impact on medical progress. Laboratory animals are now used in the study of basic (patho)physiological mechanisms, in the development, production, and evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic agents and/or procedures, as well as in safety studies to assess carcinogenic, teratogenic, or reproductive toxicity of investigational chemical and biological agents, and in education and training. The quality or utility of a model often depends on its validity, which is highest in the so-called homologous models where the phenotypical presentation displayed as well as the cause of the condition in the animal are identical to those of the human condition. Isomorphic models display similar symptoms, but the condition is not provoked by the same events as the human condition. Partial models do not attempt to model the entire condition, but focus only on limited aspects. Models can be further classified into spontaneous, induced, negative, and “orphan” models. Uncritical extrapolation of animal findings to the human condition may lead to unreliable or even dangerous conclusions. Extrapolation tends to be most reliable when a plurispecies approach is taken, and when differences in metabolic patterns and speed, as well as several other potentially confounding variables are taken into account. Animal models have been crucial to neurological and psychiatric research, even though the search for valid models has been difficult in these fields because of the differences in brain structure and function between humans and other species.",

Sixteen sexual asphyxiai deaths, reported in Dade County (Miami), Florida, are examined in detail. These data confirm that practitioners are overwhelmingly young, white, middle‐class, unmarried males. When the practice is fatal among older practitioners, the data show that some complicating factor, such as the use of alcohol or other drugs, may have contributed to the accident. The most frequent method of inducing the asphyxia was simple hanging by rope and in most cases there was no indication nor suspicion of suicidal intent",

Cet article propose d'approfondir les termes du débat en interrogeant non plus la question des besoins sexuels ou encore celle de l'humanisation des personnes ayant des incapacités, mais en analysant les raisons de cette différence de fréquence des relations socio-sexuées. Existe-t-il une (ou des) causalité(s) sociale(s) ou bien ce phénomène s'explique-t-il uniquement par des différences corporelles?",

Jealousy characteristically involves hostility if not hatred towards the person who is taking away the love one feels is due to one, and engenders bitterness, hostility, or hatred towards the person one loved. Like many emotions, envy and jealousy provide motives for action. For in both cases there are characteristic patterns of backward- and forward-looking reasons for action. There are numerous biblical tales to illustrate the evils of envy, and others that demonstrate the vice of jealousy. For the most part, qin'ah is condemned as a serious and self-destructive vice.",

It is a sexual body-image syndrome with three degrees of severity: fixation, neurosis or psychosis. Its etiology is obscure. It is subject to misdiagnosis, and to treatment that proves ineffectual. Once the status of eunuch has been achieved, the prognosis is from guarded to good. An autobiographical case report of self-castration and partial denervation of the penis illustrates a variant of the syndrome, which has proved to be self-limiting, with a good prognosis.",

      "title": "A New Perspective on Gender Dysphoria and Repetitive Sex Reassignment Surgeries",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Gender identity disorder (GID), also known as gender dysphoria or transgender identity, refers to the experience of major dysphoria or dissatisfaction with the sex that individuals were assigned at birth and the gender responsibilities related to their sex.1,2 Nationwide, stigma attached to transsexualism has made it a commonly shunned condition (with transsexualism also being a commonly shunned term) that can profoundly impact individuals’ lives, especially if left untreated. We present a unique case of repetitive sex reassignment surgeries from male to female and back again to male in a 28-year-old patient and discuss the outcomes.\r\n\r\nCase report. A 28-year-old shy, depressed married man with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder was referred to a psychiatric lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender clinic and explained his sexual identity problem that had caused him depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideas and plans. Although he was married at age 20 years and had fathered 2 children, he was still struggling to be identified as a male. He described his desire to be a girl and how he used to dress up as a girl when he was 5 years old.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the visit, he had divorced his wife, had abandoned his children, and planned to marry his male lover and to live with him as his wife. He was conscious of the impact of his decision on others and was feeling guilty about abandoning his family to marry a male partner, but was unable to restrain himself from carrying out his plans.\r\n\r\nThe patient attended 20 hourly psychiatric sessions over 12 months before presenting to the clinic with no improvement. Further endocrinology evaluations and laboratory workups for hormonal imbalance revealed no abnormalities. He received 20 more hourly psychiatry sessions and cognitive therapy for 6 months with no improvement. He was then referred to urologists for additional evaluation for sex reassignment surgery, which was completed successfully.\r\n\r\nHowever, the patient returned 10 years later with worsening anxiety and depression and suicidal ideas and plans. She stated how she had been married happily and enjoying life with her lover, yet she gradually started struggling with her gender as a female and the desire to switch back to a male. Her symptoms were so severe that she had twice attempted suicide to end her emotional pain.\r\n\r\nShe underwent concurrent psychiatric counseling and rehabilitation for 6 months with no improvement. The decision was made for her to be referred for sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy, which were completed successfully and which were followed by significant improvement in the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation at 6-month follow-up. There was no long-term follow-up on this patient and his fate.\r\n\r\nThere are no recently updated data on the prevalence of gender dysphoria. According to scant research, the prevalence of gender dysphoria is projected to be approximately 1 in 30,000, although this number is thought to significantly underestimate the true prevalence. To ensure quality of life, transgender individuals need professional medical and mental health care to transition from their birth sexual identity to their internal sense of gender.3–5\r\n\r\nEven if the number of gender dysphoric individuals is on the rise, there is little research regarding this population and their health care needs. Given the stigma surrounding this population, they are less likely to receive appropriate help, which can result in further mental and health turmoil.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are individuals who self-identify as transgender and seek extensive interventions to satisfy their internal sense of gender. This group ends up changing their physical appearance frequently from one gender to another. Given the scope of the public health burden of unnecessary repetitive procedures, it is important to conduct more comprehensive studies on this population to make sure they receive appropriate treatment and to prevent unnecessary costs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, investigating gender dysphoria and the individuals’ transition over time can benefit the treatment of psychiatric disorders among transgender individuals. It is a responsibility of psychiatrists to explore the patient’s hidden motives behind change of gender to help that patient attain a greater inner relational freedom.",

      "abstract": "Invertebrates display a great variety of different sex-determining mechanisms. While sex determination may be quite conserved in some taxa, in others it differs between closely related species or even between different populations of the same species. Sex determination and sex allocation tend to evolve interactively through the common medium of sex ratio selection. However, sex ratio conflicts can occur due to differential selection upon genes acting in different individuals (e.g. parent versus offspring) or with different transmission patterns (e.g. nuclear versus cytoplasmic). Sex ratio selection, especially when there is conflict, is probably of key importance in generating the turnover of sex-determination systems to produce the great diversity observed. Most sex-determining mechanisms can be classified as primarily genetic (GSD) or environmental (ESD) but in some cases both influences are important. In addition, cytoplasmic sex factors may be present (Chapter 9). Selection for adaptive sex ratio patterns may sometimes achieve similar endpoints using different raw material. For example, patterns of association between offspring gender and patch quality may be achieved through zygotic ESD or via genes influencing maternal behaviour in certain GSD cases. At a different level, common GSD systems, such as male heterogamety, are known to be underpinned by different molecular mechanisms.",

      "title": "AB022. The psyche of male sexual difficulties related to related to the partner.",
      "abstract": "Impression management for men aiming at courtship and love is cognitively taxing and is costly. Recent research suggests that when a man tries to impress an attractive woman his cognitive performance could be impaired and depleted. However, cognitive performance of a woman is not affected during her interaction with someone of the opposite sex (Karremans et al. 2009). By dictation of nature and anatomically too, men take an active and positive role in sexual performance; their failures in sexual performances will be revealed to the partner then and there. Men react negatively to such a failure when their confidence or self-esteems are at stake. Their psyche will strike it as a failure of life time, failure of their genetic spread and survival of the species. In subsequent sexual encounter their body and subconscious mind will switch to the physiology of anti-erectile transmission and limit the expansion of desire and arousal on other attempts. In general, we call this performance anxiety. Masters and Johnson’s pioneering work in the 70’s highlighted the negative impact of performance anxiety on sexual function. As a form of therapy, exercise such as Sensate Focus were designed for the couple to overcome the performance anxiety and phobic quality in man so that sexual arousal and penetrative erection can be practiced/achieved in a relaxed state. At the Fertility, menopausal and andrology settings of OBGYN, it is not uncommon to see male sexual dysfunctions that include lack of desire, psychogenic ED and ejaculatory dysfunctions. One of the main causes of complaints of unconsummated marriages is vaginismus (and dyspareunia) in the partner which causes psychogenic erectile dysfunction in husbands who fail to penetrate at the first or second attempts. Such couple tend to drift from sexual intimacy for months and years until there is an extended family pressure for conception. Another situation that compromises erectile capacity of otherwise a normal man with routine sexual performance is the demand from wife to perform at a fixed date during the ovulation time. Significant proportion of the sexual dysfunctions are also related to the interpersonal relationship issues. Desire and frequency of sexual episodes and erectile and ejaculatory functions suffer a dip when anger, emotional injury or disappointment and frustration accumulate and linger in the couples’ relationship. Resentment works against intimacy and trust. Some men are more sensitive and averse towards partners’ body image, odor and excessive lubrication or more frequent demands for sexual intimacy. Such men tend to avoid or may fail when attempting sex with the partner. Some others are able to get full erection during self-masturbation but could not achieve erectile capacity for intravaginal intercourse or ejaculation. Some men also shut off completely their interest for sexual engagement after witnessing a spontaneous abortion or a delivery of the baby. Some other situation where men buckled themselves from engaging in sexual activity include: after being belittled about sexual performance or hinted that penis is not up to the mark in size; wife being very shy and not reciprocating sexual desire or interest or dominant in the power play; chronic illnesses, pelvic prolapse and incontinence in partner, etc. Men who are used to unusual masturbatory technique and ejaculation also find themselves suffering from intravaginal anejaculation. Each and every couples are different. Treatment approaches should be individualistic and global with sex therapy, pharmacotherapy and hormonal adjustment if necessary.",

      "abstract": "Many of the changes that accompany physical inactivity coincide with those that occur during aging. These changes are generally grouped under the term of 'disuse' (or \"lack of use\" or \"inappropriately modulated stimulation\"). Studies of long-term space travel have revealed that weightlessness in space also induces changes resembling those of aging and physical inactivity. The relationship between disuse (due to bed rest, insufficient exercise, or lack of gravity) and aging has some definite practical implications. As life expectancy is lenghtened in all populations worldwide, the number of elderly with varying degrees of disability leading to reduced physical activity also increases. Changes induced by bed rest as a consequence of disease may also be superimposed on aging changes and further diminish physiologic reserves and accelerate pathology. Therefore, the study of disuse, irrespective of its etiology, may serve as a model for understanding not only some of the functional changes induced by lack of activity and/or gravity but also some of the disabilities of old age. Indeed, a better understanding of disuse phenomena will make it possible to establish programs of prevention and rehabilitation that will ameliorate both disuse and aging deficits.",

Our experiences with this type of sterilisation in regard to marriage stability and psycho-physical development of the children are positive. During the months of insemination, even with psychically balanced couples, conflicts arise such as disturbed vita sexualis (sexual life) emotional stress situations or aggravation from the husband's inferiority complex which can endanger the success of the treatment or even the marriage. The doctor in charge of insemination has the responsibility to discuss and analyse arising problems with the couple so that both husband and wife are emotionally and intellectually prepared when pregnancy occurs.",

      "abstract": "Questions of alternation might be read as intrinsic to sociological approaches to sexual difference and diversity. By this we mean ways in which the sexual as social scientific subject/object has oft been conceived of against the background of fluctuating conceptual and contextual registers. Terms for the empirical description, recognition and analysis of sexual life-worlds have most often been contested and queried. This might be especially so with regard to ‘sexually dissident’ subjects - those for whom terms of depiction in research and polity might be especially vexed and complex because running counter to claims to ‘normative’ modes of representation. Such processes, in turn, might be seen to respond to the alternating experiential and political framings of contemporary and historical sexual life-worlds. This has been evident in India in recent times, for instance, as non-cis-gendered and non-heteronormative subjects have found themselves on the cusp of legislative and social changes.",

Tyrannical regimes are alike because they are driven by the common aim to put into practice, at any cost, private, omnipotent, and megalomaniac phantasies of the leader. Che Guevara's personality structure and unconscious dynamic profile is completely different from those found in \"totalitarian dictators\" such as Castro, Mao, Hitler, or Stalin, who, instead responded to an unconscious need to \"possess\" and \"control\". Genital fixations will determine if the mother will use the baby to deal with her own phallic envy, but in more regressive mothers, when the fixations correspond to previous psychosexual stages, the baby could be narcissistically identified with faeces or with the breast. There is an important dilemma within the \"basic delusion\" as a mechanism used to disavow castration anxiety.",

The frequency of sexual intercourse decreases, mainly because of lack of partners or because of health problems. There are many other forms of sexual behavior; especially, the importance of tenderness is increasing. A theoretical model of factors influencing the sexuality in old age is presented.

The present day investigator has developed methods for meeting the child on his own level of spontaneous interest in sex and day to day awareness of sexual topics.

For adolescents, the new changes happening in their bodies can be overwhelming. Many things must be considered in a psychodynamic formulation that come to the fore in adolescence. For example, one's sense of gender is generally consolidated much earlier. Sexual identity may be somewhat fluid for adolescents, and experimentation is the norm. Adolescence may also be the time when cognitive and emotional difficulties first appear. Many factors can disrupt identity consolidation in adolescence. As always, traumas, family strife, and losses must be considered. A very common source of trouble in this area is drug and alcohol use disorders. Adult patients are likely to have strong memories of adolescence.",

Dadurch wird es möglich, Entstehen, Verschwinden, Dauer und Folgen von Statusinkonsistenz detailliert zu untersuchen. Die empirischen Befunde des Artikels zeigen, daß die Verortung von Individuen in einer Statushierarchie im Lebensverlauf zunehmend mit vergleichbaren Plazierungen in anderen Statusdimensionen übereinstimmt. Dies verstärkt sich in der Abfolge von Geburtskohorten; ferner finden sich eher Frauen als Männer in ungünstigen statusinkonsistenten Lagen. Schließlich hat Statusinkonsistenz deutliche Auswirkungen auf berufliche Mobilität von Männern. Eine ungünstige Statuslage „erzwingt“ Mobilität, wenn, gemessen an der Bildung, unerwartete Statusverluste ausgeglichen werden sollen. Männer mit unerwarteten Statusgewinnen versuchen dagegen, ihre vorteilhafte Statuslage abzusichern, und sind eher immobil.",

We know that recognition of the psychological sense of self as distant from the other is achieved in most infants during the second half of the first year of life. The child's dyadic relationship slowly merges into the oedipal triadic relationship with the parents by the end of the fourth year, ushering in a severely conflictual situation for children of both sexes. Curiosity about sexuality gives way, under reasonably adequate psychological conditions, to curiosity about the wider aspects of the world, a sublimation of a portion of sexual as well as aggressive wishes that continues into adult life unless inhibitions arise because of psychological conflicts that were insufficiently resolved during the pre-oedipal and oedipal periods.",

Most antidepressant drugs have adverse effects on sexual function, but accurate identification of the incidence of treatment-emergent dysfunction has proved troublesome, as disturbances of the sexual response can only be detected in a reliable fashion when systematic enquiries are made before and during the course of treatment. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of many antidepressants on sexual function has led to attempts to resolve dysfunction though adjuvant or substitution treatment approaches.

      "abstract": "A few decades ago the range of pathological forms of addictive behaviour was determined by the clinical consequences of excessive consumption of psychoactive substances. Today a lot of descriptions of new psychopathological phenomena appear, they are connected with a person’s new activities or opportunities under present-day conditions rather than with a person’s taking previously unknown chemical substances. These opportunities are connected with both having access to varieties of new gadgets and a wide range of means of creating illusions of the complete and prompt satisfaction of needs of communication, security, recognition, love, creativity, development. How much has the new opportunity era changed into the time of new addictions? The analysis showed that the prevalence of many forms of behavioural addictions is significant, particularly among young people. A disharmonic personality may shift from one addiction to another over time, illuding the people around them and specialists into thinking that this personality is “cured”. But the addiction will take another form, which will be “new” in a behavioural or technological way only. The “new” addictions reflect the ontogenetically ancient desire of a disharmonic personality to use an artificial method or technique to release high emotional tension, whether it is a psychoactive substance, communication in a social network or an impulse purchase in a shop. This way of getting rid of emotional discomfort makes a person feel pleased for a while, creates the illusion of solving a problem easily. Eventually, it leads to a reduction in the constructiveness of behaviour and the formation of addictions in a large variety of their forms. Under today’s conditions of intensive technological development behavioural addictions become more and more widespread, their definite clinical and scientific classification is not elaborated. Addictive behaviour takes various forms without changing the psychological and sociocultural mechanisms of its formation, and the degrees of social importance of these forms are varied.",

On some occasions, what they intend is to draw attention to the absence of women and to call for immediate and practical measures through which women can be encouraged or enabled to participate. On other occasions, use of the term gender acknowledges the need to shift the focus away from the assumption that things need to be done by and for women, signalling a more critical attention to men and to the ways in which their practice might need to change and what the resistances to this might be. Rarely in all of this is the term gender given sustained scrutiny. It serves often as a synonym for women; it is individualized, trivialized, not used to carry any theoretical weight.",

      "abstract": "Whilst one would not expect the incidence of male rape to approach that of female rape in our society, the finding is that it is not so rare an event as would appear from the reported incidents. Unfortunately, the underreporting of the crime supports the general acknowledgement as established fact that rape is almost exclusively a crime against women and children.\nThis is extremely unfortunate, as the effects of male rape are manifold and far-reaching.\nMale victims make it clear that the rape on its own is stressful. This strain is then exacerbated by the scepticism of family members, peers, police and the judicial system.\nRape is commonly misconstrued to be a sexually motivated crime and it is assumed that males are unlikely targets of such victimisation. That he was a victim is sometimes linked to questions being raised around the victim's own sexual orientation.\nIt not uncommon for a victim of a rape to ejaculate during the assault. In misidentifying ejaculation with orgasm, the victim is often discouraged from reporting the assault for fear that his sexuality may become suspect.\nFurther disruption in the male victim's lifestyle has been evidenced by eating and sleeping disorders, psychological reactions, drug and/or alcohol abuse, social reactions, and sexual changes.\nFinally, there is the reality of rape trauma syndrome symptoms.\nUnder South African law, rape is, by definition, gender specific. Despite the Constitutional guarantees to equality, as far as men are concerned in South Africa, the law of rape does not apply. In an attempt to remedy the dissonance, the South African Law Commission was tasked with developing relevant legislation. In its final proposals it has presented for approval, a definition of rape consonant with the Constitutional guarantees is being put forward.\nOther international jurisdictions have already introduced similar legislation.",

Despite decades of progress, this incontrovertible truth is somehow lost in the far-too-often biologically deterministic interpretation of genetic, hormonal, and anatomical scientific research into the biological origins of sexual motivation. Simplistic and polarized arguments are used in the media by both sides of the seemingly endless debate over sexual orientation, equality, and human rights with such catch phrases as ‘born gay’ contrasted against attempts of “reparative therapy” or “pray the gay away”. Though long abandoned in practically every other area of psychology, this remnant of the nature-nurture controversy remains despite its generally acknowledged insufficiency in explaining any adult aspect of the human condition within the scientific community. Methods : This article identifies three factors: 1) good intentions with regard to the argument from immutability; 2) false dichotomies limiting intellectual progress by oversimplification of theory and thus hypothesis, and most dangerously, interpretation and; 3) Tradition: a historical separation of the disciplines of biology and psychology, which, to this day, interferes with the effective translation of well-conducted science into good public understanding and policy. Results : Studies clearly demonstrate that progress toward sexual-orientation equality is being made, if slowly, despite the apparent irrelevance of the “born gay” argument from immutability. Evidence is further provided supporting the inadequacy of polarized, dichotic theories of sexual development, particularly those pitting “blank slate learning” against a fated, deterministic biological perspective. Results of this review suggest that an emerging interactionist perspective will promote both better scientific progress and better public understanding, hopefully contributing to progress toward nondiscriminatory public policy. Conclusion : Accepting that the brain is a highly plastic, modularly dimorphic, developmentally biased organ of learning, one which is organized and activated by both hormones and experiences across the lifespan, is essential for doing ‘good science’ well. Interactionist theories of psychosexual development provide an empirically sound, strong, yet modifiable foundation for testable hypotheses exploring biologically biased sexual learning.",

      "title": "Damai atau Perang? Faktor-faktor Penyebab Perilaku Agresi pada Budaya Perang Suku Masyarakat Tradisional di Papua",
      "abstract": "Fenomena perang suku yang dilakukan Masyarakat Tradisional di Papua sudah lama terjadi. Perang suku merupakan jalan terakhir yang diambil ketika penyelesaian suatu masalah secara musyawarah tidak dapat diselesaikan atau pihak yang berkonflik memang “musuh” secara permanen. Tindakan yang dilakukan dalam perang suku tersebut merupakan perilaku agresi. Perilaku agresi ialah perilaku yang bertujuan guna melukai orang lain baik secara fisik maupun verbal. Berdasarkan hasil studi literatur ditemukan bahwa penyebab perilaku agresi pada budaya perang suku adalah karena faktor internal, eksternal, stressor lingkungan dan situasiasional. Pada faktor internal, perilaku agresi muncul akibat masalah yang mengancam harga diri, kemudian masalah ini disosialisasikan dengan muatan emosi sehingga memicu perang suku. Pada faktor eksternal telihat bahwa sejak anak-anak, masyarakat tradisional sudah belajar berperang dari lingkungan sosialnya dan mendapatkan penguatan positif ataupun negative yang turut meningkatkan perilaku agresi. Pada kondisi stressor lingkungan, perilaku agresi muncul akibat kompetisi populasi terhadap sumber daya yang terbatas. Pada faktor situasional dijelaskan bahwa perilaku agresi disebabkan oleh miras, provokasi konflik politik dan lain-lain. Keseluruhan faktor di atas tidak akan terwujud dalam perilaku agresi apabila tidak ada faktor pemicu yang dianggap oleh masyarakat tradisional telah merugikan aspek social-ekonomi atau melanggar norma adat yang berlaku.",

      "abstract": "Most of the histories of bioethics focus on organizational developments, \"great men,\" clinical—technologically driven issues, and federal legal developments. Social movements are mentioned only in passing, and even then, as having influence upon medicine, not bioethics. There is no need to duplicate historical ground that is already ably addressed elsewhere in various histories of bioethics. Instead, this chapter examines some of the social movements that formed the context of the emergent bioethics, such as the consumerist movement, the consolidation of medical sovereignty, whistleblowing, and the Technological Society. These movements have, in varying ways, influenced the shape of bioethics' development and content, more specifically the issues and questions bioethics chooses to address. Some of these movements have roots in the 1800s but reach an apex at the time that bioethics is born. Others are located within the period of the development of bioethics. The movements discussed do interact, some intertwine, some stand alone; however, all affect various aspects of the field of bioethics.",

      "abstract": "Dans un contexte de revendications portées par les personnes handicapées concernant leurs droits sexuels, l’État français a été amené à se positionner en 2011 concernant la question de l’accompagnement sexuel (pratique également dénommée : assistance sexuelle). Les débats menés au sein des instances politiques, ainsi que dans les médias, sont toujours aujourd’hui largement innervés de jugements moraux, sans que pour autant la moindre fréquence des relations socio-sexuées soit expliquée. Elle reste simplement constatée, objectivée et déplorée. Cet article propose d’approfondir les termes du débat en interrogeant non plus la question des besoins sexuels ou encore celle de l’humanisation des personnes handicapées, mais en analysant les raisons de cette différence de fréquence des relations socio-sexuées. Existe-t-il une (ou des) causalité(s) sociale(s) ou bien ce phénomène s’explique-t-il uniquement par des différences corporelles ?",

Bowlby's writing on anger and aggression situated these feelings in the context of a person's emotional response to experiences of loss or separation, a rupture in their attachment relationships. In histories characterized by unrepaired losses, people found adults suffering loneliness and isolation, anxious/insecure attachments where conflicted longings for closeness can lead to needs for bodily affect regulation, such as masturbation, to calm and soothe. Boys are pressured/forced to move into a relational vacuum leading to a tendency towards avoidant attachment, making for a tendency towards relationless sexuality in adult life. Men tend to be pleasure seeking in their sexual relationships as a consequence of the deterioration of object relationships in their boyhood. Being wrong is a good thing.",

      "title": "Cyborg uterine geography",
      "abstract": "Most geographers have sided with ‘cyborgs’ (technonatural subjects) against ‘goddesses’ (e.g. Mother Earth) on questions of embodiment. In itself this provides no justification for the relative dearth (in geography) of theorizing ‘with’ the uterus as a site of doing and undoing; what I propose to call uterine geography. ‘Uterine’ relations are fundamentally cyborg, animatedly labouring and not only spatial but spatializing: they make and unmake places, borders, kin. This includes not only abortion, miscarriage, menstruation and pregnancy (whose transcorporeal and chimeric character is well documented in medical anthropology) but also other life-enabling forms of holding and letting go that do not involve anatomical uteri (such as trans-mothering and other alter-familial practices). Despite our discipline’s ostensible interest in co-production, hybridity and the more-than-human, the ‘doing’ aspects of intra and interuterine processes have tended to be black-boxed in accounts of care economies and social reproduction. The proposed remedy is deromanticization: an approach that critically politicizes uterine relations as historically contingent and subject to amelioration through struggle. Potential aides include Maggie Nelson’s idea that ‘labor does you’, Suzanne Sadedin’s account of gestation’s mutual hostility and the concepts of ‘sym-poiesis’ and ‘metramorphosis’. One notable consequence of this expanded concept of the uterine is that ‘assisted reproduction’, as it is characterized today, ceases to be categorically separate from other kinds of reproduction.",

Notwithstanding concerns of how sexuality has been defined in the extant literature, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of SA and related challenges may be disproportionately present among sexual minorities, including lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs). This trend may be especially relevant within the developmental context of emerging adulthood, an important period for development of sexual identity, and a time when individuals are already predisposed to heightened feelings of SA. The present study examined the relationship between sexual orientation (measured using sexual identity, sexual attraction, and past romantic and sexual behavior) and social anxiety (related to social interaction and social performance) among emerging adults. minority sexual identities [Welch's F(5,48.08) = 5.56, p = .002, ηp2 = .02.], same-sex attraction [Welch's F(4,108.06) = 11.27, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .04], and same-sex romantic [Welch's F(5,85.91) = 6.88, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .03] and sexual experiences[F(5,61.95) = 8.88, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .04], particularly among those who indicated attraction to multiple sexes. Findings support research that indicates that sexual minority adults experience higher levels of SA than majority (i.e., heterosexual, opposite-sex oriented) adults, and that assessment of sexuality may reflect number of sexual minorities identified. Future directions including intersections of race/ethnicity and gender are discussed.",

These problems may be associated with several physical factors such as oestrogen deficiency, menstrual difficulties or surgical menopause. Furthermore, some of the psychological and psychosocial factors, such as a negative attitude towards sex and menopause, conflicts between partners, lifestyle factors and culture, can also cause psychosexual problems in menopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Ontological OppressionThe construction of otherness because of assumptions about personhood-otherwise known as ontological oppression 1 -excludes or misrepresents bodies or identities on the basis of preset categories.Ontologic constructs of gender in oncology encompass the notions that gender is inseparable from and synonymous with sex assigned at birth (henceforth sex), that gender is a static social concept across history or a fixed identity across the personal life course, and that sex is an objective and fixed category that can be easily assessed by a clinician.In addition to sex being conflated with gender, sex is used to make assumptions about a person's anatomy, chromosomes, and/or endogenous hormones. 2 The presence of transgender and intersex people therefore challenges unquestioned assumptions and conflated concepts that are pervasive in medicine and particularly salient in oncology for several reasons.First, discourses regarding specific cancers (eg, ovarian, endometrial, prostate) are often conflated with gender.Second, cancer epidemiology is often linked to a conflated sex/gender marker (eg, breast cancer incidence described specifically for women or men).Third, oncology subspecialty care is often gendered, and in the context of cancer treatment, occupying exclusively gendered spaces may be particularly painful.Last, mistakes regarding laboratory values or chemotherapeutic dosing may be particularly hazardous.Conflated conceptions of bodies and selfhood are interwoven throughout oncology training, algorithms, and epidemiological and other biomedical analyses.Cancer epidemiology (eg, women have higher rates of cholangiocarcinoma than men), differential diagnoses, and many other core aspects of oncology rely on conflated concepts of gender and anatomy.These conflations render invisible and pathologic transgender and intersex people whose anatomy, chromosomes, or hormones do not match categorical expectations.Such ontological oppression has many consequences including stigma and substandard care.This analytic essay, authored by queer and transgender academic clinicians, researchers, nonacademic community members, and allies, proposes a systems-based approach to degendering oncology, which we define as the conscious and explicit disentangling of gender, anatomy, hormonal milieu, karyotype and other biological factors in oncologic diagnoses, epidemiological analysis, and knowledge production along with eliminating sex from our conceptual framework of bodies and disease.We provide examples of the implementation of degendering oncology, including steps that can be taken immediately by clinicians, researchers, and administrators.",

      "title": "Anthropolgical perspective on pandemic, human behavior and mental health",
      "abstract": "When a physical or mental trait is evolving, there may often be a corresponding selective pressure. Not all evolutionary traits are adaptive outcomes, but strong selection pressures can drive high levels of complex adaptive systems. And undoubtedly, the infectious disease was a strong selective pressure. Infectious diseases are one of the most common causes of animals to die earlier than expected. Because of these natural conditions, the organism has evolved a powerful, complex and sensitive immune system. The immune system can be roughly divided into three: innate immunity, acquired immunity, and behavioral immunity. Behavioral immunity is a relatively recently proposed evolutionary medical concept that refers to preemptive emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This appears as an emotion of disgust and an action of avoidance. In short, it is the natural cause of feeling dirty toward a so-called dirty object. The connectivity of dirt and disgust is a universal and crosscultural phenomenon widely observed in human and even animal society. It has developed into a complex sociocultural custom in a large, stratified society. Examples include exclusion of outgroup members, hatred of subgroups, hate of sexual minorities, and expulsion and seclusion of members suspected of being infected. Numerous cultural codes, religious rituals, and even some of civil law could be considered as the result of evolutionary struggles to prevent the spread of infectious diseases for millions of years. Like other immune systems, the behavioral immune system(BIS) is often overactive. It is a kind of allergic reaction. When a regional epidemic or pandemic occurs, emotions such as depression, anxiety, fear, anger, and disgust are activated and can lead to depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, these emotions may reduce the risk of spreading infection by reducing new contacts, uniting internal members, reducing movement and raising alertness to outsiders. It is a primitive quarantine system that requires a significant cost. It is difficult to find a balance between excessive and underactive immune responses. Often, allergies or immune deficiencies can occur. BIS is not a very efficient system nor a morally justified system, but it certainly has some practical control over the epidemic of infectious diseases during the prehistoric ear, at least. Natural selection made us have excessive prejudice and disgust toward out-group members and various minorities. The spread of infectious diseases is an important environmental trigger that evokes this primitive nature. It was not a question of right or wrong, but a question of survival for the human history. But is this primitive infection avoidance system effective in modern globalized society? There are various mental health problems and socio-cultural conflicts that take place in a pandemic situation of COVID-19. Is this just an inevitable cost? In this presentation, I will discuss desirable mental health strategies and sociocultural intervention strategies in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, based on these evolutionary medicine and anthropology. Also, I will discuss suggest quarantine strategies based on BIS.",

      "title": "Disability and Poverty",
      "abstract": "Disability is an umbrella term used to cover a wide range of physical conditions and social circumstances in which people may experience difficulties or problems in providing for themselves or participating in social activity. Of course loss or impairment of physical functions can be problematic: people who cannot see, hear, walk or clothe themselves obviously have to learn to adapt to their limited capabilities. However physical conditions such as these need not necessarily lead to social problems or social exclusion, and indeed they do not always do so. When assistance or support can be purchased or provided disabled people can and do participate fully in modern society. If they do not participate, and if they experience poverty and exclusion, it is because of their need to survive within structures that assume people are 'able-bodied' and that provide no support for those who are not — or may even directly exclude them. It is thus discrimination, rather than disability itself, which as the heart of the exclusion experienced by disabled people — and at the same time of their greater risk of poverty. For as Groves (1988, p. 171) put it, 'Poverty is disability's close companion'.",

      "abstract": "Background The onset of psychotic illness in the reproductive phase of life with a decrease in fecundity (and approximately constant incidence across populations) requires an evolutionary explanation. What is the survival value of the predisposing gene or genes? Method Evolutionary theories, including the author's, are reviewed and critically compared. Results Some theories (e.g. Huxley et al , 1964) postulate an advantage outside the nervous system: such theories fail to explain either the characteristic age distribution or constant incidence. More plausible are theories that relate the advantage to diversity of personality structure or social ability, or even to general intelligence, i.e. to the areas of function in which the phenomena of psychosis arise. Conclusions It is argued that psychosis arises as the boundary of a distribution of variation in cerebral structure generated in the course of hominid evolution. Language played a central role, with the critical changes taking place on the basis of a mutation that allowed the two cerebral hemispheres to develop with a degree of independence. Sexual selection (differing criteria in females and males in choosing a mate) acting on this genetic innovation has generated a dimension of competence in social interaction in relation to which there has been a progressive increase in cerebral size by delayed maturation (neoteny). A sexual dimorphism in cerebral asymmetry and the sex difference in age of onset of psychosis can be parsimoniously explained if a gene regulating the relative growth of the two hemispheres is X–Y homologous.",

Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

      "title": "Motivational Drive in Non-copulating and Socially Monogamous Mammals",
      "abstract": "Motivational drives guide behaviors in animals of different species, including humans. Some of these motivations, like looking for food and water, are crucial for the survival of the individual and hence for the preservation of the species. But there is at least another motivation that is also important for the survival of the species but not for the survival of the individual. Undoubtedly, sexual motivation is important for individuals to find a mate and reproduce, thus ensuring the survival of the species. In species with sexual reproduction, when males find a female in the appropriate hormonal conditions, they will display sexual behavior. However, some healthy males do not mate when they have access to a sexually receptive female, even though they are repeatedly tested. These non-copulating (NC) individuals have been reported in murine, cricetid and ungulates. In humans this sexual orientation is denominated asexuality. Asexual individuals are physically and emotionally healthy men and women without desire for sexual intercourse. Different species have developed a variety of strategies to find a mate and reproduce. Most species of mammals are polygamous; they mate with one or several partners at the same time, as occur in rats, or they can reproduce with different conspecifics throughout their life span. There are also monogamous species that only mate with one partner. One of the most studied socially monogamous species is the Prairie vole. In this species mating or cohabitation for long periods induces the formation of a long-lasting pair bond. Both males and females share the nest, show a preference for their sexual partner, display aggression to other males and females and display parental behavior towards their pups. This broad spectrum of reproductive strategies demonstrates the biological variability of sexual motivation and points out the importance of understanding the neurobiological basis of sexual motivational drives in different species.",

Entretanto, essa busca é tributária de certos regramentos principalmente em relação às suas finalidades, ao objeto paquerado e aos cenários culturais nos quais ocorrem esse processo de aproximação. Nesse sentido, a paquera pode ser constituída por rituais. Sendo assim, quais os rituais e os significados sociais atribuídos para eles nos processos de paquera? E quais são os marcadores sociais do processo ritual de paquera entre homens? A etnografia que parte dessa problemática objetiva identificar e compreender os rituais performáticos dos corpos generificados em situação de paquera homoerótica durante as edições da “Pop-ismo” na cidade de Sobral-CE. A constatação de que a paquera é um continuum ritualístico interdependente entre os contextos culturais em que se realiza é o ponto de partida da investigação. E uma das principais conclusões é a de que os corpos em performance durante a paquera reforçam a heteronormatividade, os padrões estéticos corporais dominantes e os códigos sociotemporais localizados numa perambulação reiterativa e/ou subversiva entre a “performance máscula” e a “performance rasgada”.",

      "abstract": "Although sexual desire and romantic love are often experienced in concert, they are fundamentally distinct subjective experiences with distinct neurobiological substrates. The basis for these distinctions is the evolutionary origin of each type of experience. The processes underlying sexual desire evolved in the context of sexual mating, whereas the processes underlying romantic love—or pair bonding—originally evolved in the context of infant-caregiver attachment. Consequently, not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender. Also, the role of oxytocin in both love and desire may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon that women report experiencing greater interconnections between love and desire than do men. Because most research on the neurobiological substrates of sexual desire and affectional bonding has been conducted with animals, a key priority for future research is systematic investigation of the coordinated biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes that shape experiences of love and desire in humans.",

      "abstract": "There have been several myths and misconceptions about the dichotomous understanding of sex and gender. While sex is biologically determined, gender and gender identity depend on childhood experiences, upbringing, social expectations, beliefs, family environment, and peer interactions and is socially constructed. Gender dysphoria (GD) is the extreme distress experienced by an individual because of a mismatch between their gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. GD has been an ambiguous category in psychiatry, initially termed as “gender identity disorder” till Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-5) considered removal of the term “disorder” to reduce the stigma associated. The critical element in GD is “clinically significant distress” that differentiates it from gender nonconformity. Individuals with GD identify themselves as transgender and frequently are victims of coercive social norms, discrimination, and stigma. This leads to delay in expression of distress, psychiatric mismanagement, and high comorbidity of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, self-harm, and suicidality. Though management involves a holistic multidisciplinary approach including psychotherapy, social support, and gender-reassignment treatments (medical/surgical), there has been considerable debate and ambiguity related to the same. With this background, the article critics the understanding of GD, focuses on the WPATH SOC-7 treatment guidelines, and highlights the role of mental health professionals for better care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human females exhibit greater social interest and skills relative to males, appearing in infancy, suggesting biological roots; however, male and female infants may be treated differently, potentially causing or amplifying sex differences. Here, we tested whether sex differences in social motivation emerge in infant monkeys ( n = 48) reared in a controlled postnatal environment. Compared to males, females at 2–3 weeks looked more at conspecifics’ faces ( d = 0.65), especially the eyes ( d = 1.09) and at 4–5 weeks exhibited more affiliative behaviors ( d = 0.64), including gesturing, looking and proximity to familiar and unfamiliar human caretakers. In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience. Individual differences in social interest have wide-ranging developmental consequences, impacting infants’ social interaction quality and opportunities for learning. Understanding the evolution of sex differences and their developmental emergence is necessary to best support infants with varying levels of sociality.",

      "abstract": "Addiction is a mental and / or physical state of addiction to certain psychoactive substances, behaviors or situations. They can be different, and each has its own significance, degree of intensity, psychological, social and economic dimensions. Alcohol is considered to be the most commonly abused substance in Europe, including Croatia. No celebration from the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans until today has passed without the consumption of alcohol. Also, alcohol is considered to be the first psychoactive substance that people encounter, specifically young people aged 14 years. Alcoholism is an addiction to alcohol, while an alcoholic according to the definition of the World Health Organization is a person who has become addicted to alcohol through long-term drinking, mentally, physically or in both ways and has developed mental or physical impairments and social difficulties accessible to traditional medical and social diagnostic procedures. The clinical picture of alcoholism is first manifested in the very appearance of the alcoholic, and then in his change of personality, which in turn leads to the deterioration of their own health, relationships in the family and in society, job loss. All of the above components can contribute to the worsening of the condition. The diagnosis of alcoholism is made on the basis of anamnestic data of disease symptoms, medical examination, heteroanamnestic data, which are most often given by family members, laboratory tests and various questionnaires. Alcoholism treatment consists of treatment that includes strict abstinence and lifestyle changes, then outpatient treatment and inclusion in self-help and mutual aid groups such as Alcoholics Clubs and Alcoholics Anonymous. This paper will consist of two parts. In the first part I will define the concept of alcoholism, explain the epidemiology and etiology of alcoholism, then the effects of alcohol on the body, the clinical picture of alcoholism, diagnosis, treatment, consequences of alcoholism and the role of the nurse in people addicted to alcohol. The second part consists of a survey questionnaire conducted online using the Google Docs application. The main goal of the research was to determine whether alcoholism is still the leading harmful habit in the 21st century.",

      "abstract": "The penis is a barometer for men's health, responding poorly to a variety of insults, whether physiological, psychological, social or iatrogenic. Sexual dysfunction comes at significant psychological and physical health cost. The frequency and enjoyment of sexual intercourse is strongly associated with longevity with the findings of the Caerphilly study showing a 50% mortality risk reduction in those men with high orgasmic frequency. The importance of taking a sexual history is partly in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction which is rated as high as 31% of men and 43% in women. Sexual symptoms are often indicators of underlying endocrinological, neurological, psychological and cardiovascular disease and can be related to side effects of medication or following surgical treatment. Organic issues may be more likely if the issue is: present in older patients, gradually appeared, tends to occur in all situations; is persistent/progressive; accompanied by risk factors for the organic concern; if accompanied by partnership or anxiety, they are often secondary reaction.",

      "title": "On sexual behavior and sex-role reversal",
      "abstract": "Sex is not about reproduction; sex is about (re-)combination of DNA. Sex, not reproduction, always involves physical contact between two individuals; to achieve this, strategies of sexual behavior evolved. Sexual behavior, therefore, did not evolve as part of a reproductive strategy, but evolved to enable exchange of genetic material. In multicellular organisms the situation is more complicated than in unicellular organisms, as it is impossible for each cell within a multicellular body to have sex with another cell. Hence, evolution selected a system in which the possibility to have sex was limited to only one cell-line: the germ cells. As a result, sex adopted the character of fertilization, and sex and reproduction became inseparably linked. Still, in some species, including humans, sexual behavior still exhibits features of its evolutionary past: in humans (like in bonobo's) most sexual activity and many sexual behavioral patterns have nothing to do with reproduction (masturbation, homosexual behavior, for example); in humans, sexual behavior also became associated with other strategic objectives, such as intensifying the pair bond, expression of love or power. Different genders - male and female - evolved, and each gender evolved typical gender-related sexual and reproductive strategies as well. In most multicellular species, these strategies became inextricably mixed, and sexual behavior increasingly more - and in most species even exclusively - 'served' the interests of reproduction: sexual behavior became more or less synonymous with reproductive behavior. In most species, the 'mix' of sexual and reproductive strategies evolved into typical gender-related patterns of behavior, that is, in typical 'sex-roles'. Often, males are bigger and more 'beautiful' (= more intensely ornamented) than females; males compete with each other for access to females; males court females, while females choose males ('female choice'). However, ecological circumstances may cause a reversal of sex-roles, resulting in a situation in which females are bigger and more intensely ornamented than males, females compete for access to males, females court males and only males invest in care for the young, provided they are relatively certain of their paternity. Also, as in the case of the spotted hyena, females may be highly virilized and be socially dominant. This 'sex-role reversal' is seen, e.g., when males are relatively rare due to high predation pressure, or when the process of reproduction is very risky for the same reason: then it is 'better' that males, with their plenty of sperm, are wasted, than females with their few, precious eggs. It can be argued, with women being the fair sex, exhibiting competitive behavior and with an actively displaying courtship, and with men investing heavily in their offspring, meanwhile taking all (cultural) kinds of measures to guarantee their paternity, that humans, too, exhibit some degree of sex-role reversal.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Cognitive‐behavioural interventions for sexually abused children",
      "abstract": "Methodological problems, including problems of definition, mean that estimates of the incidence and prevalence of child sexual abuse vary considerably. Unlike the majority of health problems, child sexual abuse typically refers to an event or series of events, and like other forms child abuse definitions vary accordingly amongst professionals and the public and between the public and professionals. One commonly used definition is that by Schechter and Roberge (Schechter 1976) “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities that they do not fully comprehend, and to which they are unable to give informed consent, and that violate the social taboos of family roles”. Despite differences in perceptions of what constitutes child sexual abuse there is a general consensus amongst clinicians and researchers that this is a substantial social problem which affects large numbers of children, of both sexes, of all ages, and across culture and social class (Prentky 1996, Finkelhor 1994). The consequences of sexual abuse on the social and emotional wellbeing of children and on their development are increasingly well documented, although there is a need for methodologically more appropriate and more robust studies in this field. To date, cross-sectional studies have pointed to a number of factors which appear to influence the extent and severity of the effects of sexual abuse, such as age of child, frequency and duration of abuse, severity of abuse (including penetration), relationship of child to perpetrator (see Friedrich 1986). A growing number of longitudinal studies shed some light on the likely developmental trajectory of problems over time and on those factors which limit adverse consequences and/or aid recovery (Oates 1994, Tebutt et al 1997). The effects of child sexual abuse manifest themselves in a wide range of symptoms which typically cluster around different developmental age bands. For example, pre-school children are more likely to experience anxiety, nightmares, general post-traumatic stress disorder, internalising, externalising and inappropriate sexual behaviours (see Kendall-Tackett 1993; Trickett 1997). Fear, aggression, nightmares, school problems, hyperactivity and regressive behaviour are more typical of school age children. Adolescents are more likely to suffer from depression, withdrawal, suicidal or self-injurious behaviour, substance misuse or offending. Not all victims of sexual abuse have consequent psychological problems throughout their life. However there is an association between having suffered such a trauma in childhood and experiencing higher rates of a wide range of problems in psychological and social functioning in adult life. Many of these difficulties are similar to those reported by children who have been more recently abused, including: depression, anxiety, phobias (Briere & Runtz 1988), low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction and relationship and parenting difficulties (Green 1993). Although often based on retrospective studies and so subject to biases, these findings appear consistent enough across studies to warrant acceptance of long-reaching adverse effects of childhood sexual abuse. There are two other sequelae which are particularly associated with sexual abuse, as opposed to other forms of abuse in childhood. First is the sexualising effect of sexual abuse. Young women have been reported to engage in high risk sexual behaviour (Farmer and Pollock [Farmer 1998]), and experience higher rates of sexual revictimisation (Miller 1978). Second is the small but important minority of abuse victims who go on to sexually abuse others. Factors associated with becoming a subsequent abuser are still far from clear, but early studies suggest that being brought up witnessing or experiencing intra-familial violence may combine with the experience of sexual abuse to increase the risk of a young man subsequently abusing others (Skuse 1998). Longer-term prospective studies testing and examining these consequences are awaited. Successful intervention may not only reduce the psychological and social impact of sexual abuse for a victim and their family, but also modify the impact on future generations, through improved functioning as a parent, or by reducing the number of potential abusers for future generations. Cognitive-behavioural approaches derive philosophically, theoretically and empirically from four theories of learning: respondent conditioning (associative learning e.g. of sexual arousal and trauma), operant conditioning (the effect of the environment on patterns of behaviour, particularly reinforcement and punishment), observational learning (learning by imitation) and cognitive learning (the impact of thought patterns on feelings and behaviour). They combine to provide an integrated approach to assessment and intervention which pays careful attention to the developmental and social contexts in which learning occurs. In the treatment of children who have been sexually abused, cognitive-behavioural approaches focus particularly on the meaning of events for children and non-offending parents, endeavouring to identify and address maladaptive cognitions (e.g. being permanently ‘soiled’), misattributions (e.g. feelings of blame and responsibility), and low self-esteem. In addition, interventions drawn from respondent, operant and observational learning paradigms are used to address more overtly behavioural problems such as externalising behaviours (aggression or ‘acting out’), internalising behaviours (anxiety, self-blame or deprecation) or sexualised behaviour, usually through mediation by the non-offending parent. Cognitive-behavioural approaches also have a promising record of experimental evidence of effectiveness in dealing with a wide range of emotional and behavioural problems, many of which feature in the symptomatology of children who have been sexually abused, e.g. anxiety (Kendall 1994), internalising and externalising behaviour (Harrington 1998; Kazdin 1989) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Deblinger et al 1996). Conceptually they provide a broad, evidence-based framework for assessing the effects of sexual abuse on personal, inter-personal and familial relations, and planning interventions tailored to individual circumstances. As a focussed, time-limited form of intervention it may also be a cost-effective way of helping a larger number of children than currently receive help. Previous reviews within the field (Finkelhor 1995; Stevenson 1999) also suggest that cognitive behavioural interventions, as part of a broader psychosocial intervention, may be an effective form of treatment for sexually abused children. However, these reviews have included studies of a wide range of methodological type, and have not selected studies on the basis of methodological rigour, and have included a range of therapeutic interventions. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural approaches in treating the immediate and longer-term sequelae of child sexual abuse. Studies are eligible for the review if the allocation of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or quasi-random allocation i.e. by day of week, case number or alphabetical order. Studies comparing one type of intervention with another with or without placebo control, and studies comparing one intervention versus control will be included. There are no language restrictions. Children and adolescents up to age 18 years with recent experience of sexual abuse (viz. within the 12 months prior to participation in the study) defined as “the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities that they do not fully comprehend, and to which they are unable to give informed consent, and that violate the social taboos of family roles” (Schechter 1976). Interventions which are described by the authors as behavioural or cognitive-behavioural or which describe the use of cognitive-behavioural interventions. Treatments may or may not include parents. If possible, sensitivity analyses will be used to explore the differential impact of parental involvement in treatment. Rating scales. A wide range of instruments are available to measure behavioural and psychosocial problems associated with the consequences of child sexual abuse. These instruments vary in quality and validity. For this analysis the minimum standards for the inclusion of data from outcome instruments will be i) that the psychometric properties of the instrument have been described in a peer-reviewed journal; ii) that the instrument was either (a) a self-report, or (b) completed by an independent rater or relative. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, published on the Cochrane Library will be searched. This is a compilation of about 250,000 published trials identified so far by handsearching by various individuals within the Cochrane Collaboration. Search terms will include all terms likely to capture studies by type of participants i.e. children who have been sexually abused, and intervention i.e. cognitive-behavioural approaches. Full details of the sources and search strategies are published in The Cochrane Library. A search using the same terms will be conducted within the specialist register of the Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Review Group. The following databases will also be searched from March 1998 in order to identify studies that may not yet have been catalogued in CCTR: PsycLIT, EMBASE, CINAHL, Sigle, (Clinpsych) (Lilacs) and PsyIndex. Previous reviews will be used, and references will be checked on all studies and reviews. Authors and known experts will be contacted to identify any additional or unpublished data. Efforts will be made to establish contacts in countries in which English is not the dominant language. Two reviewers (GM and PR) will independently select studies for inclusion in the review. Where possible, disagreement will be resolved by discussion. Where this is not possible the third reviewer (DJ) will be asked to assess the study in question. Where disagreement may be resolved with additional information this will be sought from the authors. Data collection. Data will be independently extracted by two of the three authors. Again, any disagreement will be resolved by discussion where possible, and when not possible, the third author will adjudicate. All decisions will be documented and where necessary, the authors of studies will be contacted to assist in resolving problems or disputes. Incomplete data. Where there is evidence of a significant differential drop-out rate between the experimental and control groups, data will not be included any meta-analysis.",

Sin embargo, no existe un fuerte consenso sobre los indicadores que determinan el poseer una buena o una mala salud sexual, y más cuando hablamos de una población de especial vulnerabilidad dados los múltiples cambios físicos, psicológicos y sociales a los que se enfrentan en poco tiempo. En el presente estudio exponemos el proceso de construcción de una batería de instrumentos para la evaluación de la salud sexual de los niños, niñas y adolescentes. Tras la realización de un completo proceso de valoración, guiado por múltiples expertos en el área, se ha concluido que tanto los conocimientos como las actitudes (p.ej. sexismo) y habilidades sexuales (p.ej. asertividad sexual) son un indicador principal. Asimismo, los comportamientos sexuales de riesgo (p. ej. búsqueda de sensaciones sexuales, adicción al sexo, al cibersexo o conductas de sexting), también se consideran variables importantes. Disponer de una batería de instrumentos validados en este grupo poblacional que recoja todos los aspectos relevantes para la valoración de su salud sexual va a permitir, no solo conocer más sobre la misma, sino también probar si la educación afectivo-sexual que reciben es adecuada y suficiente para asegurar un desarrollo sexual saludable.",

Prior to the nineteenth century, very little was written on the subject of child maltreatment. The legal and philosophical definitions of child abuse and neglect are fairly similar. In both legal and philosophical contexts, child abuse is generally defined as physical, emotional, or sexual harm done to a child. Abuse generally denotes the active harming of a child. On the other hand, child neglect is an act of omission in which a parent, guardian, or other individual responsible for a child's well‐being has failed to provide some predefined notion of adequate care. In large part, the definitions of child abuse and child neglect depend upon what types of treatment children are entitled to receive. Writers on children's rights have proposed a wide array of answers to the question of what children are owed. These answers range from defining a minimum standard of care that must be met to arguing for a fairly demanding maximizing standard.",

      "title": "Do Men Underreport and Mask Their Emotional Attachment to Animal Companions? The Influence of Precarious Masculinity on Men’s Bonds with Their Dogs",
      "abstract": "Males' underreporting of psychological issues, physical symptoms, and personal information is commonplace both in medical and psychological settings in North America. One explanation for this occurrence is men that endorse traditional forms of masculine gender roles underreport or mask their symptoms to avoid being perceived as less masculine. In a similar way, the thesis of the current study was males may also mask and underreport the strength of attachment to their animal companions due to masculinity concerns. These males may also have more difficulty explaining why the bond is of importance. To address these notions, we developed the Human–Animal Interaction Conflicts scale (HAIC) consisting of two psychometrically sound subscales that measure conflicts male owners may have related to their pets. The first subscale involves limiting affection conflict (LAC), which measures underreporting or masking affectionate behavior around animal companions. The second entails conflict explaining the importance of the bond (EBC), which results in males not providing clear or accurate remarks when attempting to describe the bond's significance. The results from linear regressions analyses support the hypothesis that males endorsing traditional forms of masculine gender (as measured by the Precarious Masculinity Scale) underreport or mask their affectionate behaviors toward animal companions. Similarly, these same men also report more difficulty placing into words the bond they have with their dogs. The current study not only has implications for mental health and medical providers but may also help explain past research where males self-report lower levels of attachment to dogs.",

      "abstract": "To describe inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB) observed in patients with dementia, we conducted searches using the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science to find relevant articles, chapters, and books published from 1950 to 2014. Search terms used included 'hypersexuality', 'inappropriate sexual behaviors', and 'dementia'. Publications found through this indexed search were reviewed for further relevant references. Sexuality is a human's need to express intimacy, but persons with dementia may not know how to appropriately meet their needs for closeness and intimacy due to their decline in cognition. Generally, the interaction among brain, physical, psychological, and environmental factors can create what we call ISB. The most likely change in the sexual behaviour of a person with dementia is indifference. However, ISB in dementia appear to be of two types--intimacy-seeking and disinhibited--that differ in their association with dementia type, dementia severity and, possibly, other concurrent behavioural disorder. Tensions develop from uncertainties regarding which, or when, behaviours are to be considered 'inappropriate' (i.e. improper) or abnormal. While most ISB occur in the moderate to severe stages of Alzheimer's dementia, they may also be seen in early stages of frontotemporal dementia because of the lack of insight and disinhibition. ISB are often better managed by non-pharmacological means, as patients may be less responsive to psychoactive therapies, but non-pharmacological interventions do not always stop the behaviour.",

      "title": "Capitalism and Disability",
      "abstract": "The social model of disability necessitates a rethinking of prevalent definitions. Leaving aside biological or physical-anthropological definitions of disability which make it appear that impaired persons are 'naturally' and, therefore, justifiably, excluded from the 'labour force', even mainstream definitions have serious shortcomings. The World Health Organization, for instance, defines impairment (the condition of being deaf or blind, or having impaired mobility or being otherwise impaired) as the physiological 'problem'; disability as restricted functions or activities resulting from an impairment; and handicap as the 'disadvantage resulting from the impairment or disability, that limits or prevents the fulfillment of a role'. This terminology has been criticized by social model theorists of disability because it relies primarily on medical definitions and uses a bio-physiological definition of normality. Further, 'the environment' within which this 'disadvantage' is located, 'is represented as 'neutral', and any negative consequences of this approach for the person with an impairment are regarded as inevitable or acceptable rather than as disabling barriers'. Reconceptualizing disability as an outcome of the political economy, however, also requires acknowledging the limitations of the 'minority' model of disability, which views it as the product of a disabling social and architectural environment. In this view the fundamental source of the problems encountered by disabled persons is prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes, implying that by erasing mistaken attitudes society will accept 'difference' and equality will flourish. This approach diverts attention from the mode of production and the concrete social relations that produce the disabling barriers, exclusion and inequalities facing disabled persons. In contrast, we take the view that disability is a socially-created category derived from labour relations, a product of the exploitative economic structure of capitalist society: one which creates (and then oppresses) the so-called 'disabled' body as one of the conditions that allow the capitalist class to accumulate wealth. Seen in this light, disability is an aspect of the central contradiction of capitalism, and disability politics that do not accept this are, at best, fundamentally flawed strategies of reform or, worse, forms of bourgeois ideology that prevent this from being seen.",

These changes are not universal, however. We live in a multicultural society with widely varying sexual mores and frequent clashes of culture across generations. The media has contributed to unrealistic expectations about body image and sexual performance while at the same time increasing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases. Consequently, patients seek help with these issues and will discuss them freely if the general practitioner is comfortable in the area of sexual health.This article outlines an approach to sexual assessment and ways of addressing the barriers faced in taking a sexual history.All sexual disorders involve biological, psychological and social factors. General practice can provide a safe, non-judgmental environment for the patient to divulge sexual difficulties and have these dealt with holistically. However, this takes time, a significant obstacle in current practice.",

Les trajectoires et experiences sexuelles se sont aujourd'hui profondement diversifiees. La diffusion des valeurs de liberte et d'egalite dans l'espace public d'abord, a l'interieur de la sphere intime ensuite, l'emergence d'un sujet et d'une subjectivite modernes, la prise en compte des interets individuels et la mise en avant des sentiments personnels... sont quelques-uns des elements qui expliquent cette evolution. La sexualite s'est transformee au point qu'il est de plus en plus frequent d'entendre parler d'individualisation des comportements sexuels, voire meme d'individualisation des normes sexuelles. D'ou, sans doute, le trouble. Car si l'idee de comportements individualises peut seduire notre conception moderne de l'individu irremediablement singulier et autonome, qu'est-ce qu'une norme individualisee ? Comment est-elle engendree ? Comment opere-t-elle ? Sur quelles instances peut-elle s'appuyer pour produire ses effets ? Comment peut-elle encore soutenir les echanges entre les partenaires ? Quelles sont les consequences, les derives, les perspectives d'un tel mode de regulation de la sexualite ? Devant cet etat des choses, nombre de questions se posent aux praticiens des sciences humaines : quelles sont les conceptions actuelles de la normalite auxquelles se referent les pratiques sociales ? Comment se posent actuellement les questions concernant l'absolu et le relatif dans la normalite sexuelle ?

      "abstract": "The assessment of sexual dimorphism plays an essential role in numerous disciplines such as: (1) forensics, with its concern with skeletal identification, including sexing; (2) archeology, where the sexing of skeletal materials is an essential aspect; (3) primatology, where sex differences are diverse; (4) paleoanthropology, where the identification of sex can influence taxonomic and phylogenetic decisions, and (5) growth and development, where one strives to identify differences before and after puberty. Other disciplines where sexual dimorphism plays an important function include orthodontics, gerontology, nutrition, and medicine. Quantitative studies of morphological forms in general, and sexual dimorphism in particular, is not a trivial endeavor in that at least two aspects are involved, namely size and shape. Focusing on the human skeletal system, sexual dimorphism affects all bones, including the cranium, pelvis, long bones, and vertebral column. However, the overwhelming numbers of studies of sexual dimorphism are based solely on size differences. These studies have repeatedly demonstrated that males are larger for most dimensions. The question of shape differences, if indeed present, cannot be readily inferred from these studies. Consequently, a number of studies were initiated, over some 20 years duration, that specifically focused on the presence of sexually dimorphic shape changes in the skeletal craniofacial complex. The following anatomical structures were examined: (1) the human nasal bones, (2) the primate cranial base, (3) the human cranial base, (4) the human dental arch, (5) the human mandibular arch, and (6) the human cranial vault. These six datasets involved 16 samples for a total of 1110 specimens. Every dataset generated statistically significant sexually dimorphic differences in shape. Thus, it is apparent that the craniofacial complex not only exhibits size differences but also specific shape differences.",

      "title": "Developmental trajectory of substance use disorders: what role do the parents play (or are perceived to play)?",
      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‘disordered’ parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects’ personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‘schizophrenogenic mother’, which stated that schizophrenia is ‘caused’ due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: “Today, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing”15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‘affectionless’, ‘controlling’ and ‘neglecting’ parents are easily labelled as ‘addictogenic’. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‘Blaming’ the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‘perceived’ parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‘Perceived’ parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‘addictogenic’ parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‘perceived’ parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects’ substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

      "abstract": "Pada dasarnya tuntutan atas kebebasan manusia dapat muncul dengan serta merta ketika terjadi picu pelatuk yang berupa ketidakadilan, atau ketika ada pihak yang merasa diperlakukan secara tidak adil. Munculnya isu isu emansipasi perempuan, tuntutan atas kemitra sejajaran laki laki perempuan, juga didasarkan atas terjadinya, baik objektif maupun subjektif, ketidakadilan. Ketidakadilan yang dirasakan kaum perempuan, sehingga memunculkan isu feminisme, termanifesasi dalam hal: Pertama, adanya perbedaan sistem imbalan dan penghormatan atas pekerjaan berdasarkan perbedaan laki taki perempuan. Kedua, terjadinya sub ordinasi pada perempuan, di mana perempuan selalu diposisikan sekelas di bawah laki-laki atau bahkan hanya menjadi bagian dari laki laki. Hal ini tidak hanya terjadi pada kehidupan individu, bahkan sosial organisasi kemasyarakatan yang akhirnya berimplikasi dalam kehidupan yang lebih luas. Ketiga, terjadinya stereotype terhadap jenis kelamin tertentu sehingga menimbulkan diskriminasi dan ketidakadilan. Bahwa laki laki pasti atau setidak tidaknya cenderung mengandung nilai nilai positif sementara perempuan sebaliknya. Keempat, kekerasan terhadap perempuan, baik kekerasan fisik seperti perkosaan, pemukulan sampai ke bentuk yang lebih halus seperti pelecehan dan penciptaan ketergantungan. Kelima, keyakinan bahwa peran gender perempuan adalah mengelola rumah tangga, maka banyak perempuan menanggung beban kerja lebih banyak dan lama dibandingkan dengan laki laki. Penelitian ini bertujuan merumuskan wacana yang berkembang dalam Efika Sosial yang membahas peran otonomi perempuan sebagai manusia. Selanjutnya diteliti sejauhmana otonomi itu mempengaruhi penentuan peran perempuan selaku makhluk sosial. Terakhir dilakukan refleksi filsafati atas realitas peran perempuan yang sesungguhnya dalam masyarakat. Bahan atau material penelitian, bahan dari penelitian ini adalah kepustakaan yang meliputi buku buku dan artikel tentang etika sosial dan moral, tentang perempuan dan permasalahannya serta kasus kasus menyangkut masalah perempuan yang terclapat dalam buku buku, artikel majalah majalah, jurnal jurnal, surat surat kabar, serta kasus kasus aktual dan faktual di lapangan yang dapat ditemukan.

Unsur unsur metode yang digunakan meliputi : (1) Interpretasi, (2) Koherensi intern, (3) Holistika, (4) Kesinambungan historis, (5) Heuristika, (6) Deskripsi. Hasil penelitian didapatkan penciptaan manusia berdasarkan jenis kelamin laki laki dan perempuan, merupakan rahasia alam dalam rangka mendukung hidup dan melangsungkan kehidupan manusia dalam arti khusus dan kehidupan alam semesta dalam pengertian yang luas. Laki laki dan perempuan bukan dalam pengertian konflik melainkan bersifat komplementer, saling berpasangan dan saling mengisi kekurangan. Nilai nilai universal yang menyangkut penciptaan manusia, martabat manusia, seringkali ditafsirkan oleh para laki-laki dalam masyarakat patriarkhi, sehingga seringkali terjadi bias yang merugikan jenis kelamin perempuan. Kalau masih dalam batas perbedaan kodrati, tidak memunculkan masalah serius. Namun yang banyak teradi justru muncul stigma baik buruk, benar salah berdasarkan jenis kelamin, sehingga muncul norma yang mendukung munculnya ketidakadilan. Penelitian ini masih merupakan hasil pembacaan buku atau literatur, diperlukan penelitian lapangan pada kondisi sosio kultural tertentu yang dapat mendukung hasil penelitian literatur. Diperlukan kesadaran akan otonomi manusia sebagai kualitas tertinggi kemanusiaan, sehingga manusia dapat hidup secara adil dan dapat membangun masyarakat manusia yang adil.

The noticed words have been classified in various groups and divided in different categories, based on the analyse of the contents of Bardin (1977). We discussed the importance and/or the necessity of the utilisation of so much synonyms that relate to sex/sexuality. After the analyse of the words, we found out that there is still a difficulty that people show when it comes to speaking out words that relate to sexual subjects; by that their resistance and the lack of information are transfered to the students, and this fact is denoting a sexual repression and a consistently necessity of Sexual Orientation, in schools, envolving the whole educating community, to know: fathers/mothers, teacher, the pedagogical and administrative groups, employees and students.

      "abstract": "Sexual consent refers to people's internal willingness to engage in sexual activity with another person-as well as their external communication of that willingness. Internal and external sexual consent can vary by type of sexual behavior; however, previous research on sexual consent has primarily only assessed \"typical\" sexual behaviors such as genital touching, oral sex, and vaginal-penile sex without providing further context or acknowledging people's sexual diversity. Therefore, we provided an initial account of people's sexual consent-and lack thereof-for a broader array of sexual behaviors and contexts in which they occur. Using an online cross-sectional survey of participants in the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 658, 50.5% women), we examined event-level internal and external sexual consent for 20 sexual behaviors or contexts. Women reported significantly lower levels of sexual consent feelings than men for 12 of the 20 sexual behaviors and lower levels of active consent communication for 7 of them. Almost a third of participants (31.0%) had experienced at least one of the listed sexual behaviors against their will. Of those, participants on average reported nonconsensual experiences with 3.1 of the 20 types of sexual behavior listed, ranging from 1 to 11. More women reported at least one nonconsensual experience with one of the sexual behaviors assessed compared with men (47.9% versus 22.3%, respectively). We discussed several behavior-specific findings regarding sexual consent and the lack thereof. We also made recommendations for initiatives aimed at promoting healthy sexual consent practices: embrace sexual diversity, emphasize sexual agency, and encourage active consent communication.",

      "abstract": "The studies on the expression of deaf people sexuality are scarce (rare) and usually they do not emphasize the issues concerning the sexual and love attachment out of the heteronormative main stream.In order to fi ll the lack of research in this area, the present article investigates the deaf people narratives on their primary homosexual experiences and their strugle against the double prejudice: on being deaf and homosexual.This research is part of a qualitative approach, having as methodological instrument the semi-structured interviews.The data reveal that the homosexual condition of the deaf people is still little understood on account of many doubts, prejudices and myths about their sexual and emotional attachment experiences.Moreover, the narratives of the interviewees showed that their fi rst same sexual relation, without their consent, occurred into their familiar and domestic environment (home and school), fact that becomes the essencial basis for the constitutional process of their further sexuality.These issues point to the need for an extension of the investigations considering the emotional aspects, language and the construction of sexual identity interface.In addition, it suggests a special attention for the deaf people, due to their specifi c language characteristics and their social vulnerability, as well as the need for the development of effective public policies for this social group.",

      "abstract": "The sex and gender identity disorders of the DSM are reviewed. The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining \"normal\" sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.",

      "abstract": "When a baby is born, the first medical pronouncement is usually, \"It's a boy,\" or \"It's a girl.\" In most cases, this pronouncement is based simply upon the appearance of the child's external genitalia. Due to variations in the process of sexual differentiation, sometimes the gender that should be assigned is not apparent from inspection of the external genitalia, either because they are \"ambiguous\" or because their appearance is not congruent with the internal anatomy. Decisions must be made not only about the most appropriate gender to assign the infant but also about the medical and rearing practices that will facilitate optimal psychological development and quality of life for the affected individual. This article will review the approach to managing gender disorders that has evolved since the 1950s. Three issues are identified as central to current shifts that are occurring in the management of these disorders: (a) increased understanding of the biological substrates of gender identity; (b) questions regarding the indications for irreversible cosmetic genital surgeries as a means of reinforcing gender assignments in infancy, and (c) ethical issues pertaining to informed consent and who is entitled to give it, particularly with regard to surgical gender reassignments in infancy. In keeping with the neuropsychiatry theme of this issue, the focus of this article is on prenatal sexual differentiation of the brain as it pertains to the question of psychosexual neutrality at birth.",

In fact, pornography is so commonplace that soon we will be unable to imagine a time when there were multiple obstacles to acquisition. Arousal patterns may be further intensified by the voyeuristic presentation of violent pornography, increasing susceptibility to escalation. The viewer may experience their libido diminishing as pornography takes the 'sex' out of sex. When a patient is at the stage of experiencing difficulties only with partnered sex there may be reluctance to admit that their 'satisfactory pornography driven sexual experience' may even be a factor. Sexual dysfunction recovery times seem to relate to pre-porn exposure to masturbation and sexual experience. If there has been a sexual template set prior to their compulsive pornography use then it can be re-awakened, as it will still exist within their limbic system memory.",

      "title": "One Final Word: Sex",
      "abstract": "Sex transforms life. It affects morphology and behavior. It diverts enormous amounts of time and energy from the business of survival. It can even distract from the manufacture and safe packaging of offspring. The adolescent metamorphosis we each experience once, and thereafter view with amazement, in the relative calm of adulthood, has swept through nature on a grand scale, culminating in orchid flowers and peacock tails. All of this is due to chromosomal recombination—sex sensu strictu (Ghiselin, 1974)—and its organismal result, sexual reproduction or cooperation between two individuals to produce offspring. It is sex as sexual reproduction, the developmental side of sex that initiates the ontogeny of new individuals, that I mainly discuss here, though it is sex as recombination— the genetic side of sex—that has received most attention in discussions of the maintenance of sex. Of all the major transformations in the history of life, the evolution of sex is the most enigmatic. The question is not so much how sex got there as why it remains. Given the importance of genetic similarity, or kin selection (Hamilton, 1964a,b), for the maintenance of cooperation within and among organisms, sex seems designed to be disruptive. It requires the union of genetically dissimilar individuals, which dilutes the relatedness of mother and young, leaving the mother to invest in offspring genetically only half like herself. This has been called “the cost of meiosis” or the “twofold cost of sex” (Williams, 1975). It is a cost that usually falls to females, with their greater investment in eggs and care of offspring. By this view, the male is a parasite of his mate and participation in sexual reproduction is contrary to the best interests of females, who would do better to reproduce parthenogenetically on their own. Yet, among animals, only about one in one thousand species are thelytokous, that is, secondarily asexual, with no facultative or alternating sexual generation and no interaction with males. The prevalence of sexual reproduction in higher organisms is “inconsistent with current evolutionary theory” (Williams, 1975, p. v).",

In answer to these challenges, a conceptional distinction is proposed between sexuality per se, describing an aspect of an individual’s personality, and sexuality in actu, describing manifest sexual fantasy and behavior. Sexuality per se subsumes hetero- and homosexuality as well as conditions traditionally called “perversions” on the same de-pathologized level and calls them adult sexual organizations. The use of the terms perversion and perverse is restricted to a specific mode of sexuality in actu, i.e. when, in sexual activities, non-sexual functions have gained priority over sexual drive satisfaction. This clarifies which sexual activity may be an issue of psychoanalytic scrutiny and of often successful therapy and which not. Two case examples and a brief look into psychoanalytic literature illustrate the proposal.",

      "abstract": "For many centuries, the physician’s interest in the female body and, consequently, in the diseases linked to the genitourinary system and the differences between the sexual organs, tended to concentrate on philosophical traditions whose origins were rooted in anthropological, religious, magical and superstitious notions, rather than actually making use of biological observations. Even when the great authors speak of ‘woman’s illnesses’, they almost all refer to pregnancy and childbirth and thus celebrate their exclusive and recognised social role as ‘breeders’. There was only one exception, in other words, when dealing with diseases that could affect the female breast and, in particular, tumour pathology. Precisely because the breast could be identified as a more immediate sexual attraction for men, this organ was considered their personal ‘property’, especially after having nourished them and subsequently fulfilling them sexually, and therefore great interest and special attention was paid to any diseases affecting it. As a result, the breast wrote its own ‘history’, which followed two parallel and often overlapping paths in the 14 th -16 th centuries: the first pigeonholed it as ‘‘traditional knowledge’, expressed in Recipes and Secret Advice dedicated exclusively to women; while the second took form in the production of treatises in the medical field, which exploited the progress in anatomic knowledge on physiology and pathology carried out on respectively healthy and sick organs.",

The patients seeking abortion come to the social counselling session after they already have obtained the necessary indication confirmation from the physician; they do not come in most cases to consider ways of carrying the pregnancy to term. The pregnant woman should undergo social counselling before receiving the indication confirmation.

Societies may also institute specific rules or laws prohibiting incest. The types of relationship prohibited by incest taboo or incest law vary across cultures and societies. Some prohibitions ban relationships between members of a biological line of descent, a household group, or a network of intimate care, while others may permit marriage between cousins or sexual relations within households or across generations. Even where incest is prohibited, incestuous relationships may persist or even flourish because it is politically, economically, or socially advantageous and/or remains erotically charged because of its intimate or taboo nature. Estimates about the prevalence of incestuous practice vary and often involve debates about the role of gender and power in various kinship arrangements.",

This link can also deal/treat with the incestual fantasies that the trauma enhanced. Another figure of “incestuality”, which can be observed in those contexts, is tyranny. The clinical observation of children who are handicapped frequently reveals a development of tyrannical links. Such tyrannical links are also the effect of an attempt to deal with incestuality, to resist incestuality. If “incestuality” is primarily a violence done on the other, on his subjectivity, paradoxically, it is also, in this traumatic contexts, an attempt at repairing the link. The suture of the genealogical links is especially sought through the encroachments of the imagos and the transmission fantasies which can be frequently observed.",

However, retrospective self-reports may be unsuitable for estimations of the inherent level of sexual motivation. We review data on automatic (unconsciously controlled) responses and measures of implicit motivation during exposure to sexual stimuli. These responses and measures are inaccessible to willful manipulations and make it possible to determine whether the sex difference in answers to questionnaires is replicated when volitional response manipulations are unlikely. We complement the human data with observations from some rodent and non-human primate species. The attentional resources allotted to stimuli with sexual relevance as well as genital responses to such stimuli are similar in men and women. Measures of implicit motivation also fail to detect any sex difference. Finally, the frequency of masturbation is superior in female infants before the age at which social expectations begin to determine behavior. Neither in rodents nor in non-human primates is there any clear-cut evidence for sex differences in motivation. It seems that males and females are similar with regard to the intensity of sexual motivation. The responses to questionnaires may be affected by social learning of sexual scripts and/or the inferior quality of sexual experiences in women, among other things.",

Using cross-sectional data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II; Mage = 68 years, SD = 3.68; 50% women; N = 1,514), we examine age differences in behavioral (sexual activity), cognitive (sexual thoughts), and emotional (intimacy) facets of sexuality and investigate associations with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging. Older age was associated with less sexual activity and fewer sexual thoughts, but not with differences in intimacy. Relative to a reference sample of 22- to 36-year-olds within BASE-II (N = 475), the average older adult reported considerably fewer sexual activity and thoughts (ds > .60), but only slightly lower intimacy (d = .20). Substantial heterogeneity existed among older adults, with almost one third of the 60- to 82-year-olds reporting more sexual activity and thoughts than the average younger adult. Examining correlates of sexuality among older adults revealed that, covarying for diagnosed illnesses and performance-based grip strength, psychosocial factors (e.g., partnered, relationship satisfaction) accounted for considerable shares of variance in sexual activity and intimacy, whereas age and gender explained more of the variance in sexual thoughts. Some psychosocial factors exhibited similar-sized associations with all sexuality facets, whereas other factors operated in more facet-specific ways. To illustrate, participants reporting more loneliness also reported less sexual activity and less intimacy, but not fewer sexual thoughts. We discuss implications of our findings for theories of successful aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "Maternity Leave for the Commissioning Mother",
      "abstract": "Physical requirements play a prominent role in employment. Generally speaking, physical requirements are demands that somebody meets certain physical characteristics as a precondition for a job. They can take the form of facially neutral demands concerning qualities of the body, like height, weight or BMI, but also concerning a person’s physical fitness, in physically demanding professions such as the police, the military, the rescue services or coal mining. Typically, it is more difficult for women to meet such requirements than it is for men – that is, they have gender-specific effects. But physical requirements may also be explicitly sex-based. They may take the form of what in US law is called a ‘bona fide occupational requirement,’ when only a man or only a woman is considered for a certain job. Finally, physical requirements may also refer to certain cultural expectations concerning how a person ‘performs’ masculinity or femininity, for example by institutionalizing gender-specific clothing regulations or by banning specific items of clothing that are typical for one gender or the other, such as headscarves worn by some Muslim women. The focus of this paper is on exploring the various dimensions of physical requirements in the labour market and on the tensions that exist between physical requirements and the principle of gender equality as enshrined in EU law. It will first deal with differential treatment based on a characteristic directly related to sex, to be followed by the exploration of facially neutral physical requirements that have different effects on men and women. Finally, the paper will turn to the issue of clothing regulations as a specific form of physical requirements that may target the genders directly or indirectly, and often in intersectional ways, that is, in a combination of several grounds of discrimination, such as ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. All of these issues will be considered in the light of EU law, particularly the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) based on the old Equal Treatment Directive of 1976, now no longer in force, and the Gender ‘Recast’ Directive of 2004.",

Regardless of the nature of day-to-day social interaction, the annual cycles of nearly all reptiles include at least one social event, mating. Physiological, morphological, and behavioural events that lead up to mating include the maturation of gonads, the development of secondary sexual structures, and courtship. Mating by some species is associated with high levels of gonadal activity, whereas in others it occurs when levels of sex steroids are low and the gonads are undeveloped. In this latter situation, mating is not followed immediately by fertilization, and sperm are stored for later use.",

The rather negative image of the menstrual cycle which prevails is incorrect, and obscures the benefits which it offers. The empirical work which now exists provides a rigorous basis for a changed perception of the whole cycle. Throughout the cycle there is evidence of biologically-determined fluctuations in nervous system activity, which in turn are related to psychological and behavioural changes. There are now findings which clarify the relationship between these natural fluctuations in nervous system activity on the one hand and, on the other, in changes in mood, social interaction, and perception of self and of personal problems. There are in addition studies which demonstrate how the less propitious arousal levels can be changed by, for instance, moderate exercise or muscle relaxation; also how optimal advantage can be taken of those fluctuations which predispose to positive outcomes. At a time of increasing applications of empirical findings to the improvement of health and well-being, the reproductive cycle can be seen as one vehicle for improving the quality of life of many women.",

People often cannot detect it properly and misunderstood it for physical impotence. Psychological impotence is basically caused by psychological problems. Most of the times, this kind of impotence are curable. Recent study has shown that most of the cases of impotence are basically of this nature. Numbers of sexual problems were found to be frequent. Physical, social/emotional, and relationship factors were all found to have a significant impact on the prevalence of one or more sexual problems. In addition, we observed an important gender difference: increasing age was more consistently associated with sexual problems among men. Thus, sexual problems among women and men appear to share similar correlates, but physical factors may play a larger role among men. However, as men age, there may be more psychological and relationship issues as well that influence their sexual satisfaction and performance.\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tKey words: Psychological erectile dysfunction, psychological impotence, erectile dysfunction.",

      "title": "Religious Influence and Premarital Sexual Experience: Critical Observations on the Validity of a Relationship",
      "abstract": "Until now, studies of religious influence on premarital sexual experience have made an implicit assumption that the first occasion of sexual intercourse, whether for males or for females, is consensual. However, recent studies by feminist and other researchers have indicated that at least some degree of coercion is present in a sizeable minority of initial occasions, especially for girls and young women. To the extent that such is the case, religious constraints upon sexual activity cannot be considered relevant for the nonconsenting partner. Failure to take this issue into account has partially undermined the validity of even the most recent studies and might account for some anomalies in those studies. Sociologists of religion have long maintained, and their research has usually confirmed, that religiosity at the individual level acts as a constraint upon early sexual activity outside of marriage. This relationship seems to hold whether religiosity is defined as church participation or as commitment to conservative religious beliefs. Sexual activity (the presumptive dependent variable in this relationship) is typically defined as sexual intercourse, with the implicit assumption that at least the first occasion of intercourse (or of any other form of genital contact) was consensual. Respondents in surveys are considered either virgins or nonvirgins on the basis of whether premarital intercourse is admitted, with the usual hypothesis that the rate of virginity will be higher among the religiously committed than",

      "title": "Integration and Modularity in the Evolution of Sexual Ornaments: <i>An Overlooked Perspective</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract The expression of sexual ornaments often reflects male health and overall physiological condition, and females mating with the most ornamented males are assumed to produce the best-adapted offspring and receive the most benefits from such males (Andersson 1994). However, there are a number of unresolved issues in the evolution of sexual traits that reflect males’ condition. On one hand, sexual traits, such as deer antlers, beetle horns, or elongated bird tails, are under strong directional selection for greater expression, and this selection favors reduced integration (e.g., favors modified allometric relationships) between sexual traits and the rest of the organism (Eberhard 1985; Emlen and Nijhout 2000). Indeed, most sexual traits are “stand-alone” structures (e.g., deer antlers are far less integrated and more variable than frontal bones of which they are a part). On the other hand, sexual traits are expected to indicate the physiological condition and health of an individual, such that the expression of sexual traits represents a complex summary of many organismal processes (Wedekind 1992; Johnstone 1995). However, to be such a summary, sexual traits should be highly integrated into many organismal functions. This represents a paradox where sexual traits are expected to be both less integrated for greater expression, and more integrated to better indicate physiological quality.",

      "title": "Practicing vaginistic femininity: Doing bodies, enacting normative heterosexuality",
      "abstract": "Introduction'Sex' may evoke various feelings and various associations in different people. For some, it means pleasure, for others power and for others again love; it may provoke feelings of proudness for some, and shame for others, and it may be associated with pain and fear. Although statistics vary, most of them agree that about 30% of women experience some kind of sexual pain at one point in their life, while about 15% is affected by long-term sexual pain disorder, which, apart from making coitus (penetrative penile-vaginal intercourse) painful, hardly performed or impossible perform, may also cause problems in wearing tampons or visiting gynecologists.Studies of female sexual pain disorders that I had opportunity review, as well as blogs, videos and newspaper articles addressing issue, report women experiencing feelings of inadequacy and isolation, low self-esteem, secrecy, shame, guilt and loss of femininity. These negative feelings acquire meaning in context of normative heterosexuality. Many authors argued not only that is normative, but that it also has an enormous regulatory power (Kaler 2006: p.52 and there mentioned authors) which is exercised through a hegemonic and naturalized set of practices (ibid: p.53). A central practice, and thus most hegemonic and most naturalized one, is penetrative penile-vaginal intercourse, whose centrality has been called 'coital imperative' (Jackson 1984). This imperative is so deeply enrooted into people's perceptions of sex that even today, after sexual liberation and female rights movements, and despite separation of reproduction and sexuality, people still equate 'real sex' with coitus (McPhillips et al. 2001), have difficulty thinking of 'sex' without reliance on insertion and penetration (Kaler 2006: p.59, referring Annie Potts), and want conceive their children 'naturally' or 'in love' (Kaler 2006: p.62).Heterosexuality implies existence of 'men' and 'women' (Kaler 2006), and is thus inseparable from notion of 'normative gender'. West & Zimmerman (1987) argued that gender is not natural set of traits or variables, but rather the activity of managing situated in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex (West & Zimmerman 1987: p.127). According them, gender is product of social doings, it is constituted through interaction (ibid: p.129) and it is done through a complex of socially guided perceptual, interactional, and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of masculine and feminine 'natures' (ibid: p.126). 'Masculinity' and 'femininity' are considered be expressive behaviors, i.e. an evidence of male and female essential natures; since people internalize this notion, they conduct themselves fit their own notions of expressivity (Goffman according West & Zimmerman 1987: p. 129). As Butler (1988) puts it, people are not born women and men - they engage into corporeal acts that make them become what is socially regarded as 'woman', or 'man'.According Kaler (2006: p.54), Butler does not only ground gender, as well as heterosexuality, in performance, but she also depicts them as performatively and normatively indistinguishable. Thus, taking into account centrality of coital imperative for heterosexuality, we could say that becoming 'woman' or expressing ones 'femininity' in heteronormative surrounding means having coitus with men. Indeed, it can still be heard in informal talks that 'a girl has become woman' after getting menarche (i.e. when she became able bare children and is thus 'biologically' ready for sexual intercourse) or after having engaged into coitus (i.e. having 'lost her virginity'). Several feminist scholars as well pointed that to be 'woman' in heterosexist society means sex with men. The category of 'women' thus has no meaning outside heterosexuality (see Kaler 2006: p. …",

      "title": "Women's Competition and Aggression",
      "abstract": "Abstract For female mammals, the rewards of aggression (such as increased rank) rarely outweigh the costs (injury or death). These costs exert a stronger effect on natural selection in females than males because offspring survival depends more strongly on maternal than paternal survival. To support the proposal that greater avoidance of aggression (and other risky activities) by women is mediated by a more reactive fear system, experimental, psychometric, hormonal, and neuroimaging studies are reviewed. Evidence suggests that monogamy, characteristic of the Homo line for over a million years, has resulted from sexual conflict (reproductive advantage accruing to women more than men) rather than sexual selection (within‐sex advantage to men who remained with a single mate). However, monogamy means that women as well as men must compete for the best mates. This competition is usually expressed through intersexual strategies in which women advertise those traits favored by men or through low‐risk indirect forms of within‐sex aggression (e.g., stigmatizing, ostracizing). Ecological factors including age, early menarche, operational sex ratio, extreme variance in male resources, and local cultural norms can decrease the threshold for women's use of direct physical aggression.",

To reveal such hidden substitution processes by visual signals, the measurement of the static as well as the dynamic subjective visual vertical was performed in 65 healthy subjects of different age. The static subjective visual vertical was found to be stable among all subjects, whereas the shift of the dynamic subjective visual vertical during rotation of the background scene gradually increased with age. There was a significant difference between males and females in this trend. Females usually showed greater deviation with increased age.

      "abstract": "Netsex, or cybersex, may be thought of as the mutual textual simulation, or narration, of sexual activity between people online. Branwyn (1993, p. 786) divides Netsex into three different types. First is that in which people “describe and embellish real-world circumstances” such as touching themselves, taking their clothes off, and so on. They may or may not be performing these actions, but probably not if they are typing reasonably steadily. The second type involves “a pure fantasy scenario” in which people jointly create a story with relatively coherent expectations. This can be performed before an audience. The third type involves one party giving instructions to another who supposedly performs them. These techniques involve textual references to sexually charged notions of gender (anatomy, actions, clothing, and so on), which are frequently exaggerated to fit the story. It is now possible to transmit real-time video pictures from a camera attached to a person’s computer, and this may also be used for Netsex. However, people often express ambivalence about this, perhaps because it emphasises the distance between people, is not as mutually intense, or because it increases possible disjunctions. The disruption of expectations of narrative in Netsex is often a source of online humour. A final, often mentioned, but currently fictional form of Netsex is virtual teledildonics, in which a complete sensory field is simulated via electronics.",

      "title": "Older married couples’ sexual expression: A dyadic latent class analysis",
      "abstract": "Many older adults continue to engage in sexual behavior, most often in the context of long-term marriages. Prior studies have tended to examine older adults’ sexual behavior, desires and motivations separately. Thus, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of the multifaceted-nature of older couples’ sexual expression. Using dyadic latent class analysis and data on 953 heterosexual couples in long-term marriages from Wave 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we describe configurations of couples’ sexual expression. Four latent classes were identified. Within each latent class, couples were largely in agreement about their sexual behaviors, but husbands consistently expressed greater desire and motivation than their wives. In the highest engagement class, couples reported more frequent and wide-ranging activities (vaginal sex, oral sex, intimate touching), more frequent thinking about sex, greater satisfaction with their amount of sexual activity, and placed more importance on sex as part of their lives. In the lowest engagement class, both spouses indicated no sexual activity in the past year, but neither spouse was content with this situation even as both agreed sex was not an important part of life. Demographic, relational, and health factors were associated with membership in different classes. Health factors—especially sexual difficulties—were most predictive, with husbands’ health more associated with latent class membership than wives’ health. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of sexual expression among older married couples, geriatricians and other health practitioners should provide care that recognizes a wider array of activities and the potential for unmet need. Sexual expression is an important component of older adults’ health and well-being.",

B. der Kinsey-Report oder der Hite-Report nur Stichprobenergebnisse liefern, die methodisch und statistisch nur eingeschränkt repräsentativ sein können. Dennoch haben diese Umfragen interessante Perspektiven eröffnet. Immerhin haben danach ca. 5–10% der Männer homosexuelle Aktivitäten. Der außereheliche Geschlechtsverkehr hat seit den sechziger Jahren kontinuierlich zugenommen. Dies nicht zuletzt durch die verbesserten Empfängnisverhütungsmöglichkeiten. Die Angaben über die sexuelle Aktivität sind eher widersprüchlich. Sie ist wohl in den jüngeren Altersgruppen am höchsten. Im primitiven Gesellschaften findet täglich Geschlechtsverkehr statt. Unsere modernen Gesellschaften scheinen demgegenüber vergleichsweise inaktiv. Aus verschiedenen Umfragen weiß man, daß sich Männer und auch Frauen häufiger Geschlechtsverkehr wünschen, sie aber nicht mit der in der Ehe praktizierten Sexualität zufrieden sind.",

      "title": "The Myth of Nepal-to-India Sex Trafficking: Its Creation, Its Maintenance, and Its Influence on Anti-trafficking Interventions",
      "abstract": "For the past ten years, the phrase \"human trafficking\" in Bangladesh has been used to address a wide variety of crimes and human rights abuses associated with the recruitment, movement, and sale of people into a range of \"exploitative\" and/or \"slave-like circumstances.\" 1 A basic problem with the \"human trafficking paradigm\" in Bangladesh is that many of the elements and definitions for this social phenomenon are often limited in their scope and do not adequately reflect the totality of the problem. Likewise, few attempts have been made to develop usable conceptual frameworks that allow for the many variables to be encompassed under a single umbrella. 2 For example, when several professionals in Bangladesh who were directly associated with addressing the \"human trafficking\" sector were asked what the phrase really meant to them, a wide variety of different descriptions were given. Depending on the person questioned, trafficking was defined any number of ways—as a legal problem, a human rights problem, a gender problem, a child labor problem, a health problem, a migration problem, or a combination of one or more of these. Those who felt that trafficking was a legal problem 200indicated that if adequate laws were established and law enforcement agencies and systems were further strengthened, then traffickers could easily be arrested and prosecuted and the problem would go away. Those focusing on trafficking as a migration problem indicated that if appropriate migration policies could be established, implemented, and monitored systematically within Bangladesh, a less irregular, less vulnerable movement of people would occur, thus resulting in a reduction in trafficking. Similar explanations were given for the other problem classifications. Thus, depending on how a given person defined the problem, his/her definitions often dictated what solutions were proposed—legal problems required legal solutions, gender problems required gender solutions, etc. In summary, even after nearly ten years, the sector has continued to lack a standardized and consistent conceptual clarity among those who are working to reduce the problem.",

      "title": "The Role of Complicity in the Ethics of Embryonic Stem Cell Research",
      "abstract": "In everyday language, means taking part, in one way or the other, in a crime or wrongdoing done by another person. In general, the role of the is not strictly of the same quality as that of the main actor or, in legal terminology, of the principal. As a rule it is judged to of minor gravity. Nevertheless, if the offense is grave enough, the may be found guilty, in law, as an accessory to the crime, or, in general morality, become the object of reproach as standing in a relation to the wrongdoer analogous to that of accessory and principal. During the last decades, bioethical discussion has considerably extended the scope of the concept of complicity. Quite a number of further semantic facets were added to its standard meaning, making the concept extremely fruitful for a fine-grained ethical analysis of certain constellations involving a plurality of agents (cf. Singer 1993, 165 f., Luna, 1997, Friele 2000). These extensions concern weaker kinds of collaboration or collusion with a morally wrong act than the legal concept, in particular practices of making use of the results or products of a morally wrong or morally problematic activity. This kind of eating fruit from a forbidden tree is not usually subjected to the same criticism as the wrong act itself (henceforth W). But complicity continues to imply some kind of offensiveness. The concept keeps its negative connotation, though the degree to which the wrong of the accomplice (henceforth C) is held be condemnable is usually significantly lower than that of the act to which it is accessory. Though the act of the accomplice is much less grave than the original act, it nevertheless leaves a moral stain, however weak, on the accomplice.",

      "title": "The function of female resistance behavior: intromission by male coercion vs. female cooperation in sepsis flies (Diptera: Sepsidae).",
      "abstract": "Female resistance behavior that occurs prior to intromission does not by itself imply forced copulation. Such behavior may function instead as a test of the male in order to favor some males over others, or to induce the male to desist. Thus, male persistence and forcefullness may sometimes be better described as persuasion rather than coercion. Under the persuasion hypothesis, the male only gains intromission due to an active response of the female. Under the coercion hypothesis, male and female are opposed in a physical battle which the female loses if copulation occurs. In species in which males are morphologically incapable of forcing intromission without active female cooperation (I argue here that this is probably a very common situation), data on the behavioral and ecological context in which resistance occurs can distinguish between the two possibilities. Partially congruent functions of resistance, seen from the female point of view, are female resistance to screen (male persuasion), and female resistance to avoid males non-selectively (male coercion). Sepsis flies illustrate these ideas. Females often struggle energetically in apparent attempts to dislodge mounted males and to prevent intromission, and males grasp females with powerful species-specific structures on their front legs and genitalia. This suggests the possibility of coerced intromission. But behavioral and morphological evidence demonstrate that active female cooperation occurs at the moment of intromission, and that males are probably dependent on this cooperation because they are not morphologically equipped to force their genitalia into those of an uncooperative female. Despite the impression from previous publications, male insects in general may seldom be able to achieve intromission by genitalic force. The species-specific forms of the grasping genitalia of male sepsis are probably not the result of an evolutionary arms race between coercive males and unselectively resistant females.",

      "title": "The Evolutionary Basis for Human Tolerance – Physiological Responses",
      "abstract": "For most animals, unfamiliar members of other groups present more of a threat than an opportunity, and are best avoided or even attacked. In contrast, our attitudes are markedly different. There is no denying that we are capable of being hostile to people we do not know, particularly if we feel anxious or threatened. However, compared to other animals, we are unusually open to new relationships, and form strong bonds with individuals outside our family group. Although we tend to focus on the ‘thinking’ part of our minds, or our cognitive appraisal of social situations, our physiological responses and emotional reactions play a central role in how we build and maintain relationships. Subtle changes in ‘gut feelings’ can have an important influence on our attitudes to people around us, particularly to unfamiliar outsiders or people we have not seen for some time. An understanding of how different hormones affect social behaviour in other species, as well as in humans, provides insights into the type of changes that led to increasing human ‘friendliness’. Genetic and anatomical evidence documents subtle changes in neuroendocrine function in recent human evolution after 300,000 years ago that appear to have played an important role in increasing tolerance of unfamiliarity, and abilities to forge new external bonds. Being able to make external connections, and form new relationships based on give and take despite lengthy periods apart, seems to have been important to our success as a species. Friends in distant communities may often have been important to survival by providing resources or help that could buffer the effects of crises and resource shortfalls. We find that it is genuine emotional commitments to distant friends, rather than strategic alliances, that allow modern hunter-gatherers to survive in times of crisis. Changes in emotional dispositions towards being less aggressive and more tolerant of unfamiliar individuals might seem to be progress, but we should be cautious in thinking in these terms. Increased ‘friendliness’ is not without its disadvantages. It also brings downsides in terms of social sensitivities and emotional vulnerabilities that influence much of human behaviour.",

      "abstract": "Transsexualism observed \"Vive la difference\" might well be the mating call of the lusty, masculine male, a male, that is, who is not only biologically masculine but whose gender identity is the same.A very few biological males exist, however, whose gender identity is decidedly feminine and who regard \"la difference\" as an abomination.They see themselves unequivocally as women, a belief which reaches near-delusional proportions-and one which may be reinforced by narrowing the gap between fantasy and reality by the surgical removal of the offending male sexual organs and the substitution of simulated female ones.Such grossly aberrant men are true transsexuals (the condition occurs less often in women) and are to be differen- tiated from transvestites, who obtain a degree of sexual excitement from cross-dressing, or homosexuals, who know themselves to be men but obtain sexual gratification mainly or exclusively from other men.The three conditions can, however, overlap to some extent.With modern hormonal procedures coupled with advances in the technique of plastic surgery the operation demanded by male transsexuals is now available-sex reassignment surgery.From time to time the names of alleged successes hit the head- lines as, for example, those of Christine Jorgensen, Roberta Cowell, Jan Morris, and, a relatively recent addition to the list, that of the six-feet-tall top model Tula.Of particular importance is the case of April Ashley, n'e George Jamieson, not so much because George Jamieson was transformed into what Judge Ormrod had occasion subse- quently to term \"a convincing feminine pastiche\" but because of the autobiographical account1 of her case just published.Marred as it is by a good deal of literary candyfloss and unnecessary revelations of the goings on among the somewhat rancid social creme de la creme with whom she mixed, the book is, nevertheless, an excellent account of male trans- sexualism and one which should commend itself to anyone interested in this intriguing but sad human condition.April Ashley fulfils almost all the criteria needed to establish a diagnosis of the syndrome.The environmental setting was right.She despised her father, who was a cook in the Royal Navy and not often at home and whom she describes in no uncertain terms as a scoundrel and a boozer.She was, therefore, driven into a dependence on and preference for her mother.Her psychosexual development was right; at the age of 15 she said of herself: \"I was taunted for being like a girl and, yes, I wanted to be one.\"This preoccupation with her gender identity grew: \"I was convinced a monstrous mistake had been made and only my being a woman would correct it.\"After one of several suicide attempts she was admitted to a mental hospital, where heroic attempts were made to alter her determination.She was subjected to ether and thiopentone abreactions and to electric convulsion therapy and given male hormones.It all ended in dismal failure.She told her doctor, \"No matter what you do you'll never be able to change my mind.\"",

      "abstract": "Although the future may be open, it is tempting to think of the past as set. However, there is a sense in which the past too is changeable. New perspectives sometimes colour or even alter our view of the past. In some cases, new perspectives offer a deeper understanding of our own past experience. For example, in reflecting on what at the time seemed like a minor spat, an estranged spouse may look back and recognize unappreciated tensions. On other occasions a fresh perspective may distort memory. From the bitter vantage of a relationship gone awry, one might come to misconstrue innocent bickerings as the reflection of dark feelings that never actually occurred. If memories for prior social interactions are indeed influenced by present understanding then they may be particularly vulnerable when our understanding of the social relationship changes over time. Memory for sexual abuse may fall into this category. The label of \"sexual abuse\" is somewhat fuzzy, particularly as it is applied to oneself (Joslyn, Carlin, & Loftus, 1998). One could experience an abusive event, but not categorize it as such at the time. Later, if the experience is recalled in the context of abuse, it may be remembered quite differently than if it were recalled in some other context.",

      "abstract": "A top urologist’s prescription for better sexual health and overall wellness. According to research studies, men with health problems, and more specifically sexual health problems, are more likely than women to have had no recent contact with a doctor regardless of income or ethnicity. This reluctance to seek medical help means that for men, their diseases often go undetected until it is significantly progressed, and this late discovery has serious consequences. To make matters worse, when men do see their physicians, many doctors find it difficult to talk about sexual health with their patients. Common conditions such as erectile dysfunction or Peyronie’s disease (an acquired penile curvature) are often dismissed or simply go unaddressed. This avoidance creates real health problems: erectile dysfunction (ED)alone affects as much as 20% of men worldwide, occurring in as much as 52% of men between the ages 40 and 70. Serious skin cancers, penile injuries, and infections can go untreated for years. And, doctors lose a valuable tool in predicting other chronic health issues when sexual health isn’t discussed. Dr. Burnett takes a deep dive here into identifying what healthy sexual function actually looks like, and clearly identifies the distinct components of the male sexual response that every healthy man experiences. For each of these components, readers will learn about the specific problems that can present, their underlying or contributing causes, and how each can be resolved. It will explode the myth that the only way to enhance men’s sexual health is through testosterone therapies. Instead, his effective prescription for enhanced sexual function and overall health highlights the best that evidence-based medicine has to offer: a comprehensive mixture of easy yet important lifestyle changes, the most advanced medications including hormone therapies when they are appropriately administered, mental health therapies, external aids, and surgery. In total, readers will have a cutting-edge life strategy for achieving optimal sexual health now and for years to come.",

      "abstract": "From the phenomenological stance, anxiety represents a ubiquitous phenomenon, independent of sex and gender characteristics, as well as identity distinctiveness (heterosexual, homosexual, and transsexual). The differences are possible and presented in anxiety generators i.e. triggers, its' manifestations and coping strategies, etc. The contemporary theoretical standpoints make the important distinction between sex and gender identity. Sexual identity is determined by the anatomical attributes, whereas gender identity refers to the continuous subjective experience of one's own sex. Gender is directly related to gender roles representing anticipated, imposed, socially desirable behaviours that are sexually differentiated. Although gender related stressors are inevitable, individual coping strategies determine the level of efficacy of individual adaptational styles. Neither man nor women can be perceived as having a higher risk of developing gender anxiety disorder. Moreover, the sexes seem to be equally susceptible to it. The studies of the domain underline the importance of coping mechanisms which, if not efficient in dealing with gender stressors, result in chronic anxiety in women, making them more prone to the development of depression, and in substance abuse in men.",

Ironically, in brothels–different from supposedly normative (homo)sexual relationships–commerce with women is necessary, even though the main fantasy being sold is the centrality of male sexual indifference. With women being more aggressive in brothels and men more passive, the body language of the two genders is often reversed. One of the most common explanations we hear is that, unlike women, men have a \"biological drive\" to have sex with many partners. According to this view–traditional in Western sexual philosophy–brothels permit men to maintain social monogamy while exercising their biological imperative. In carioca brothels, instrumentality, denial of subjectivity, reduction to body, reduction to appearance, and silencing seem to apply. The main fantasy that men consume in a brothel is one of their centrality. The brothel is an inversion of normal courting behavior.",

      "abstract": "Objective Since the concept of sexual was first introduced in the 1970's, two schools of thought have emerged amongst sexologists and mental health providers regarding whether hypersexual behavior should be characterized as an addiction, or if it is part of a co-existing psychiatric disorder. The objective of this study is to help clarify this debate. Method A literature review was conducted to explore these opposing viewpoints. Articles published from the year 2000 to present relating to the topic of addiction, hypersexuality, sexual compulsivity/impulsivity were reviewed to determine whether or not hypersexual behavior can be characterized as an or if it can only co-exist with a current psychiatric disorder. Result The activities of sexual behavior are pleasurable due to the release of endorphins and enkephalins, and the receptors in the brain that bind these neuropeptides are the same ones that bind exogenous chemicals that produce the euphoric feelings described in addiction. Some proponents of have even advised a 12-step treatment program because it is an characterized by patterns of compulsive sexual behavior despite adverse consequences-relationship difficulties, neglect of work obligations and social/family responsibilities to pursue or participate in sexual behaviors, and excessive amounts of time seeking these opportunities. Conclusion Despite standard and even increasing use of the term sex addiction in media and popular culture, mental health professionals remain divided in regards to this subject. The notion of hypersexual behavior as an warrants further exploration, especially since how it is defined may dictate treatment modality.",

To determine whether evidence is logically relevant to a matter requiring proof the judge must formulate a generalisation from his own experience and what he understands to be conventional wisdom. There are problems with this approach, however, for some aspects of human life are more widely understood than others, and what is thought to be a valid generalisation may in fact be nothing more than a vague or unwarranted stereotype. Moreover, conventional wisdom itself may be suspect because different cultural groups (including different generations) are unlikely to view the world in the same way or share the same values. What might appear to be a valid generalisation to one generation might well be considered absurd by another. Problems such as these have bedevilled the law governing the admissibility of the complainant's sexual experience in cases where the accused is alleged to have committed rape or some other sexual offence against her.",

Most people in this culture are vulnerable to sexual concerns that may arise out of ignorance, cultural inhibitions, unrealistic expectations, and anxiety about performance. Because of the importance attached to sexual competence, the physician's efforts to improve the quality of a patient's life through prevention, treatment, or referral are worthwhile. Principles of therapy for psychiatric aspects of male sexual dysfunction tend to be simple and easily applied. Therapy is most effective when both partners are treated together. The physician stresses learning and encourages the couple to focus on pleasure rather than on performance. With minimal effort, the physician who is willing to try can do a great deal to help patients with sexual dysfunction.",

Deterrents to sexual activity may include society's disapproval of sexual expression by the elderly, lack of a partner, the elderly person's own lack of sexual knowledge or belief that nonreproductive sexuality is wrong, and lack of privacy. Physicians must accept elderly people's sexuality and develop attitudes and skills which facilitate communication. It is particularly important to make elderly patients aware that they do not have to have intercourse in order to express their sexuality, and to educate them about the physiological and pathological changes with aging, so they realize these changes need not mean the end of sexual expression.",

Previous research has suggested that frequent users of pornography also experience signs of behavioral addiction such as loss of control over use and preoccupancy with thoughts of using. Research has also suggested that frequent users experiencing signs of behavioural addiction are more likely to copy or fantasize about imitating what the see in pornography. However, most research has shown that only individuals experiencing psychopathic personality traits are the ones who will imitate what they see in pornography. A study of 1,060 persons explored the effects of addiction to pornography, the dark triad and personality, and addiction to sex as contributing factors to the perpetration of aggressive or violent sexual behaviours. Persons with higher scores of psychopathy and problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviours were more likely to behave aggressively sexually, but the findings also indicate that, regardless of personality, individuals experiencing lower levels of sexual satisfaction also reported more sexual aggression.",

Although at this time the myth continues spreading in some sport settings, there are not scientific studies that indicate that maintaining coital sexual intercourse is detrimental to athletic performance. Based on physiological, metabolic and psychological measurements, it has been found that sexual intercourse does not affect positive or negatively physical performance in males.

      "title": "Assessing Sexually Abused Children",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is an event in which an adult is involved and the child is left confused, frightened and ashamed (Kempe, C.H. & Kempe, R., 1984). The child may have been hurt, or be excited, or both. If abuse has occurred over a prolonged period, the child may be flat, withdrawn and apathetic or angry, defiant and difficult. Some children and young people may also express their distress through self harm, or become anorexic, or run away to live on the streets. The emotional impact is what needs to be understood, what has happened in the individual's mind, if we are to intervene most effectively. Sexual abuse is of a different order from other forms of abuse, because of the linking up of sexuality and aggression. Such violence results in a very primitive destruction of the child's mind. Irving Kaufman (1989) used the evocative term 'soul murder' to describe emotional abuse. In sexual abuse, there is nearly always an element of physical abuse, but there is also serious emotional abuse. At one and the same time, the child's mind and body are being 'raped'. The child's body may recover fairly quickly once the abuse has ceased, but the mind is left profoundly traumatized. While we do not yet fully understand all that happens to the developing mind, the more we struggle to do so, the more damaging sexual abuse is revealed to be (Renvoize, J., 1983; Morris, M., 1982; Baker Miller, 1976).",

      "title": "The Whore Stigma: Female Dishonor and Male Unworthiness",
      "abstract": "Whore means prostitute. And a prostitute is a woman who offers to hire her body for indiscriminate sexual intercourse, or so says The Concise Oxford Dictionary. Prostitute is further defined as a verb: to prostitute oneself is to sell one's honor for base gain or to put one's abilities to infamous use. Other dictionaries include men1 secondarily in the noun definition and specify in the verb definition the shame attached to dishonor and the unworthiness and wrongdoing attached to infamous use. The noun clearly denotes a person, especially a woman, offering heterosexual sex, in particular intercourse, for money; the verb denotes any person's activity, which need not be sexual, put to uncommendable use. Those meanings are likely to conform to popular opinion except that many people collapse the second definition into the first. A prostitute then becomes one who sells her honor by offering to hire her body for base gain or for an unworthy doing, specifically sexual intercourse. The following discussion will begin by comparing the dictionary's noun definition with the actual behavior of prostitutes. Since a whore is a prostitute, both words will be used interchangeably throughout this text. Actual whore life is described for the purpose of testing formal as well as popular definitions with reality. There are many reasons for exposing the reality of prostitution. Nonprostitute women are socialized not to possess sexual information or skill, not to talk about sex, not to ask for money in any situation, and not to associate with whores. A sharing of prostitute financial and sexual practices with nonprostitute women challenges that socialization, challenges the divisions it imposes upon women, and challenges the normative assumption of female sexual and financial dependency.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study uses questionnaire data from 301 terminated romantic relationships to investigate hypotheses concerning the conditions under which a quality that is initially appealing in a partner is later disliked (i.e., a “fatal attraction”). Individuals are expected to be prone to fatal attractions when they are attracted to a quality in a romantic partner that is “different” in any of three ways: (1) different from the individual's own qualities (i.e., dissimilar); (2) different from average (i.e., extreme, or unique); or (3) different from normative expectations (i.e., gender atypical). Such attractions are less likely, however, when individuals are drawn to similarity in another. Findings from a logistic regression analysis provide support for four of the five hypotheses. Fatal attractions are significantly more likely when an individual is drawn to partner characteristics seen either as “dissimilar” from her or his own, as “unique,” or as “extreme” in nature. When these characteristics are viewed as “similar,” disenchantment is less likely. Fatal attractions are neither more, nor less, probable, however, when partner qualities contradict gender stereotypes. A qualitative analysis of open‐ended questionnaire responses provides further support for these attraction patterns. The findings have implications for diverse theories, including those of mate selection and dialectics.",

      "title": "Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale",
      "abstract": "In the early 1980's, there was a startling realization that children are often sexually victimized by other children. With this understanding has come a serious confusion as to what constitutes normative sexual expression and what is sexual exploitation. This article discusses the two stances that have been prevalent: 1) discourage or ignore sexual behavior in children and hope that it goes away, or 2) persistent sexual behavior, particularly with other children, is either pathological or a definitive sign of emerging pathology. The disparity and myopic nature of both positions makes them unacceptable. How do we then take a more balanced and accurate view of childhood sexual expression, given our new sensitivity to children exhibiting sexually offending behavior? The Inappropriate Sexual Behavior Scale is presented as a tool to take into consideration normative sexual themes and behavior in children and the possibility of developing sexual pathology. The Discovery that Children are Sexual Beings Historically, it is difficult to determine just when the realization occurred that children, as well as adults, are sexual creatures with all the resulting ramifications. From a sociological perspective, it is clear that what our culture still considers part of childhood (11 to 18 years of age) in many cultures would have already undergone the rite of passage to adulthood. With this passage comes the responsibilities and privileges associated with adulthood—work, conscription into the army, leaving home, taking a partner, and freedom to be sexually active. Presently, in third-world nations, large percentages of their armed forces are younger than the legal age to view rated movies in the United States. It is ironic to the point of absurdity what children in our culture are exposed to, concerning sexuality and the restrictions we place on their response to this exposure. Television, movies, magazines and even comic books frequently depict mild-to-strong sexual themes such as nudity, sexual suggestiveness, sexual behavior and sexualized dominance and violence. Yet, about the only culturally agreed upon sexual behavior of children is to ask a biology question or two. When it comes to sexuality, the disparity between the physical or hormonal clock and the cultural clock exacerbates the difficulty.",

The understanding of prejudice has in recent years become one of the major concerns of social science. Numerous studies undertaken during the past decade have considerably increased comprehension of the phenomenon. The earlier notion that the cause of prejudice was to be sought in the nature of its object has all but disappeared. It is sometimes still encountered, but chiefly as a conciliatory gesture to stimulus-response theory (if a response exists, some stimulus must have called it forth) or, almost apologetically stated, as a variant of Merton's (33) self-fulfilling prophecy (minority groups develop certain characteristics as defenses against prejudice or because of limitations imposed upon them). Early studies of prejudice were mostly statistical or descriptive-how many people in a given group showed prejudices, in what areas, against which groups. More recent research has dealt largely with personality correlates of prejudice, its development in children, and to a lesser extent with social, cultural, and situational factors which lead to its growth or favor its expression. As one consequence of these investigations, prejudice has come to be recognized as a symptom in a total personality configuration or syndrome, appearing under given social and historical conditions, as the review by Van Til and Denemark (50) indicated.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "Die Selbstbefriedigung ist unter Männern so weit verbreitet, daß es wahrscheinlich nur sehr wenige Männer gibt, die sich nicht irgendwann einmal selbst befriedigt haben. Selbst bei Kleinkindern wurde Selbstbefriedigung beobachtet. In der Pubertät ist es sicher die häufigste sexuelle Verhaltensweise. In Ehen mit sexuell unterschiedlich aktiven Partnern dient sie als Regulativ, bei Behinderten und alten Männern ist sie ebenfalls die oftmals einzige verfügbare Quelle zur Lustgewinnung. Dennoch wird die Masturbation in praktisch allen Kultur- und Religionsformen negativ bewertet. Möglicherweise hängt dies damit zusammen, daß sie eine Form der sexuellen Betätigung ist, die ausschließlich der Lustlösung dient und völlig losgelöst ist von Fortpflanzung und sozialer Kommunikation. Eine gewisse Tabuiisierung der Masturbation als Notlösung erscheint sogar sinnvoll; würde doch eine Gemeinschaft aussterben, wenn sich alle Männer darauf beschränken würden, anstatt sich die Mühe zu machen, eine Partnerin zu suchen. In früheren Zeiten wurde versucht, die Tabuisierung der Selbstbefriedigung medizinisch zu stützen, indem man ihr eine Gesundheitsschädigung attestierte. Der Mediziner Tissot stützte mit Hilfe seiner medizinischen Autorität diese Vorstellungen.",

      "abstract": "This special issue brings reproduction into a critical mobilities framework. We extend scholarship in cross-border reproductive care and medical mobilities into new theoretical and empirical directions. Reproductive mobilities articulates the mutual constitution of reproduction and mobilities. Human (and nonhuman) movement not only shapes reproduction but produces reproductive imaginaries, desires, futures, trajectories, as well as the subjectivities and 'becoming-ness' of diverse reproductive subjects. Through the lens of reproduction, we examine how contemporary mobilities—and immobilities—intersect with gendered, racialized, sexually expressive, nation-inscribed, fertile, infertile, young, aging, pregnant, surrogate, and/or otherwise non/reproductive bodies and persons. Can human reproduction be analyzed without noticing all things mobile and immobile that converge to construct reproductive (and non-reproductive) desires and practices? Can mobility and immobility be considered without thought to how worlds and worlding comes about? Mobility facilitates reproduction, and new possibilities for reproduction; reproduction is mobile at scales from the molecular to the transnational. This effort to bring the fields of reproduction and mobilities into dialogue does not introduce a new sub-field but rather creates the opening for a trajectory of empirical work and theoretical ideas that invigorates mobilities with newfound attention on the matter and becoming-ness of reproduction.",

      "title": "Anomalies of Human Sexual Development: Clinical Aspects and Genetic Analysis",
      "abstract": "Disorders of human sex determination result in malformations of the external and internal genitalia. These malformations may vary from sexual ambiguity to complete sex reversal (XY female, XX male). Most of the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the mammalian sex determination pathway has been derived from the genetic analysis of intersex patients. Clinical management of these conditions critically depends on a precise understanding of their pathophysiology. Until recently, only transcription factors such as SRY, SOX9, DAX1, WT1 and SF1 were known to be responsible for abnormal gonadal development and sexual ambiguity. Gonadal dysgenesis may be isolated, as in the case of SRY mutations, or associated with abnormal development of other organs, such as bone or adrenals, consistent with the spatial expression profile of the disrupted genes (SOX9 or SF1). WNT4 is a new sex-determining signalling molecule. Deletions of Wnt4 were shown to be responsible for the masculinization of XX mouse pups while its duplication and overexpression in humans leads to XY sex reversal. Similarly, duplications of loci containing DAX1 or SOX9 have also been shown to cause sex reversal. These results support the emerging concept that mammalian sex determination is dosage sensitive at multiple steps of its pathway.",

      "title": "Reproductive Tactics of Male Savanna Baboons",
      "abstract": "Abstract The strongly related parameters rank, age and period-of-residence determine which reproductive tactics a savanna baboon male will use primarily. Baboon males go through the following phases with respect to the use of mating tactics, as they are longer in the group and thus grow older and, as a rule, drop in rank: Phase 1. Peripheral, relatively little social contact, low mating success, building up of a social bond with a few females. Phase 2. High mating success, based on individual fighting ability, social bonds mainly with females that are, or will soon be, sexually attractive. Phase 3, variant a. (Males that were very successful in Phase 2). Considerable time devoted to guarding infants conceived in phase 2 and to the mothers of those infants. Mating activity drops sharply compared to Phase 2. Phase 3, variant b. (Males that did not go through a very successful Phase 2). Low mating success through whatever tactic, relatively peripheral. Phase 4. Relatively high mating success, partly through collaboration with other males. Considerable time is invested in the care for potential offspring and their mothers. Phase 5. Diminishing share in the total mating activity in the group. The support for infants is spread over a relatively large class of infants conceived after immigration. Social contact with a large number of females. The data did not show the relation between agonistic rank and mating success predicted by ALTMANN'S priority-of-access model. A modification of the model is presented, which allows for coalition formation among males that are too low in rank to be successful on their own. This model could not fully explain, however, the exceptional success of some middle ranking males. The theory of Coalition games can give insight in the processes that lead to distributions of mating success that depart from the modified priority-of-acces model. The lack of agreement between the data and the original priority-of-access model cannot be explained by higher selectivity of the high ranking males. The only qualitative parameter of consorts obtained, according to which high ranking males had an advantage, is the time of the day on which mating activity takes place. This is a direct result of the way in which males obtain their consorts. Consorts are often formed in the sleeping trees during the night or in the early morning. In that situation single, strong males have an advantage in conflicts against coalitions of lower ranking males. Lower ranking males have a relative advantage later in the day, when conflicts are fought out on the ground.",

      "title": "A Dynamic Systems Framework for Gender/Sex Development: From Sensory Input in Infancy to Subjective Certainty in Toddlerhood",
      "abstract": "From birth to 15 months infants and caregivers form a fundamentally intersubjective, dyadic unit within which the infant's ability to recognize gender/sex in the world develops. Between about 18 and 36 months the infant accumulates an increasingly clear and subjective sense of self as female or male. We know little about how the precursors to gender/sex identity form during the intersubjective period, nor how they transform into an independent sense of self by 3 years of age. In this Theory and Hypothesis article I offer a general framework for thinking about this problem. I propose that through repetition and patterning, the dyadic interactions in which infants and caregivers engage imbue the infant with an embodied, i.e., sensori-motor understanding of gender/sex. During this developmental period (which I label Phase 1) gender/sex is primarily an intersubjective project. From 15 to 18 months (which I label Phase 2) there are few reports of newly appearing gender/sex behavioral differences, and I hypothesize that this absence reflects a period of developmental instability during which there is a transition from gender/sex as primarily inter-subjective to gender/sex as primarily subjective. Beginning at 18 months (i.e., the start of Phase 3), a toddler's subjective sense of self as having a gender/sex emerges, and it solidifies by 3 years of age. I propose a dynamic systems perspective to track how infants first assimilate gender/sex information during the intersubjective period (birth to 15 months); then explore what changes might occur during a hypothesized phase transition (15 to 18 months), and finally, review the emergence and initial stabilization of individual subjectivity-the period from 18 to 36 months. The critical questions explored focus on how to model and translate data from very different experimental disciplines, especially neuroscience, physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive development. I close by proposing the formation of a research consortium on gender/sex development during the first 3 years after birth.",

      "abstract": "Gender is a socially constructed concept influenced by social practices, norms, and expectations. The impact of gender differences on mental health has been long recognized, with consequences such as over-diagnosis and pathologization or under-diagnosis of some disorders depending on gender. This also has implications for the treatments that each gender receives. In this narrative review, we will analyze (a) the gender differences in the prevalence of mental disorders, (b) the explanations for gender differences in mental health, including biological, social constructionist, and sociocultural risk factors, and (c) the gender differences in the treatment of mental disorders, including differences in health-seeking behavior and treatment outcomes. Overall, there is a consistent pattern of differences in prevalence, with women more likely to have internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety or depression) and men more likely to have externalizing disorders (e.g., antisocial personality or substance use). The explanations aimed at disentangling the reasons for these gender differences are complex, and several approaches should be considered to achieve a comprehensive explanation. In addition to biological factors (e.g., hormonal changes), social constructionist factors (e.g., biased diagnostic criteria and clinicians' gender bias) and sociocultural factors (e.g., feminization of poverty, gender discrimination, violence against women, and prescriptive beauty standards) should be considered. Future studies in the field of mental health should consider gender differences and explore the bio-psycho-socio-cultural factors that may underlie these differences.",

For men with PD, additional factors may play a role. Let’s think about this in more detail. Impotence implies difficulty with sexual performance—problems achieving and maintaining an erection, which should lead to ejaculation. Before considering all the things that can disrupt sexual performance, we should recognize that occasional impotence is common. This is something that can and does happen to even the most macho guy. Men are at their sexual peak during their teenage years and a little after. With passing decades, not only does the urge for sexual gratification decline but also the ability to perform. Hence, as men pass beyond the years when all they think about is sex, occasional impotence is fairly common. We need to accept this, just as we are stuck with the joint pains that never bothered us when we were young, or the middle-age requirement for reading glasses.",

Once formed as a consequence of conflict, the superego functions as a major component of (subsequent) conflicts. 3. Its role in conflict is diverse. It functions now as defense, now as the equivalent of a drive derivative arousing unpleasure, and now as a calamitous unpleasure to be avoided or mitigated. 4. For a young child \"moral\" equals approved by parents, while \"immoral\" equals the reverse. The crucial moral questions at the time of life when the superego is largely formed are, \"What will win or forfeit parental approval?\" and \"What will rouse or dissipate parental wrath?\" 5. From the side of ego functioning, superego formation involves much more than identification with parental superego demands and prohibitions. Any aspect of ego functioning which furthers parental approval and/or avoids disapproval and punishment can and does participate in superego formation. 6. From the side of the drives, both libido and aggression are involved in superego formation. Hence masochism plays a role in normal superego formation and functioning as well as in those pathological cases which Freud called moral masochism. 7. Superego pathology is not to be understood, as it has been generally understood by analysts until now, in terms of defective or incomplete development. Everyone has a fully formed superego. Superego pathology must be understood on the same basis as is the pathology of any compromise formation.",

Individual, relational, and network characteristics that influence network instability in the absence of a significant life transition/crisis are less understood. We focus on those ties that transition from active to dormant. Because the shift to dormancy is often interpreted as a reduction in support or social capital, it is considered problematic. This study is based on longitudinal survey data of middle‐class adults who did not undergo life changes. Even in this context of relative stability, support networks experience rates of dormancy similar to those observed during periods of major upheaval. Tie dormancy is unrelated to individual characteristics, network size and density, or homophily along dimensions other than sex. Frequency and medium of communication are particularly notable as factors that were not related to tie dormancy. Ties were less likely to become dormant if they were geographically or emotionally close, immediate kin or neighbors, highly supportive, the same sex, or more embedded in the network. These findings provide context for how support networks operate when not buffeted by exogenous forces. They provide a baseline for understanding the impact on networks of transitions, trauma, new media, and difficult life circumstances.",

Despite recurrent speculative claims in the literature, it does not mediate or facilitate sperm transport through its uterine contractions.

      "title": "Sex/Gender Differences in Addictive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Addictive disorders are characterized by a decrease in functionality, leading to significant disruptions in daily life, due to the excessive use of certain substances or behaviors that initially induce pleasure, but ultimately result in a loss of control. There are sex/gender differences in the pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, and treatment of addictive disorders, since these disorders are caused by an interplay of biological and socio-environmental factors. It is crucial to take these differences into account in both research and clinical practice. From a neurobiological perspective, women may exhibit a faster progression toward addictive disorders, due to their reward circuit's heightened sensitivity when exposed to addictive substances. Additionally, they may be more prone to relapse because of their increased sensitivity to stress and withdrawal symptoms. The prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders is higher in men, but in Korea that belongs to Asia, alcohol use disorder is now more common among women in their 30s than among men of the same age group, reflecting an increase in prevalence among women over the last 10 years. Gaming disorders are more prevalent among men, while social media overuse is higher among women, who have a stronger emotional and interpersonal orientation than men. In treating addictive disorders, it is necessary to implement specialized programs for women. However, these programs should not perpetuate bias, while given the rising number of women with addictive disorders, we need strategies to improve their access to these programs.",

      "abstract": "Most typically Eros and the erotic are understood to mean physical or sexual desire or love. Sex lies on the margins of any reach towards the erotic, and with it comes a suffocating mix of fears, concerns and constraints. In its usage as an adjective in English, 'erotic' is typically used as a qualifier, pointing to a particular aspect or quality of experience. For instance, if someone were to use the term 'erotic relationship' it would generally be assumed that this implied sexual activity. As with the expression of erotic energy, the 'goodness' of sex is assessed pragmatically, and with critical attention to issues of consent, power and the impact on all involved. A pragmatic assessment of the behavior and consequences that emerge from either an encounter with the erotic or an engagement in sexual behavior is better assessed through a rigorously pragmatic lens where the welfare of all are considered.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to offer several anthropological reflections on the presence of religions in the current world, focusing on taboo — an element that is present in religions such as Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. Taboos are prohibitions enforced in most cases by supernatural sanctions. For instance, food taboos, sexual taboos, space taboos, or clothing taboos can be found in all major historical religions as part of the basic indications that affect the believers’ specific, practical behaviour, informing them on how they should shape their lives and their worlds. On the other hand, these instructions or prohibitions are often related to gender, since certain taboos apply only to women. For instance, this is the case of sexual taboos, such as menstruation taboos or postpartum taboos, all establishing prohibitions that may foster the already extended inequality of treatment between men and women.

      "abstract": "This presentation seeks to explore the cultural meaning of sexual pain. The cultural context in this case, being the Scandinavian/Northern European culture; how is it perceived, how is it treated, is it accepted as real, or rejected as “merely psychological”? Is sexual pain compatible with the cultural perception of a “healthy”, “successful” sexuality/body image? Studies show that most women who experience sexual pain, continue the activities that hurt (Laan, ref.). This could be due to psychological or relationship factors, but could also have something to do with the cultural view on pain, and “real” sex as intercourse. This points to intercourse still being the primary sexual activity among heterosexual couples, and also, unfortunately, to sex being something to be endured, not necessarily enjoyed, at least for women. One could wonder what the implications are of treating vulvodynia with lidocaine, enabling intercourse, and merely postponing pain, instead of focusing on non-painful sexual activities, what is the message being sent to both women and their partners?",

      "title": "Discrimination against Women on the Romanian and European Union Labour Market",
      "abstract": "IntroductionDiscrimination is a widely spread social phenomenon, deeply rooted in the history of the human society, with manifestations specific among the feminine population. We mention that, in almost all the countries of the world, the females represents half, or even more, of the entire population, which shows the dimensions of the phenomenon of discrimination and its multiple manifestations. Furthermore, the discrimination against women phenomenon is much more accentuated in the societies that have a lifestyle based on the traditional values and norms (religious/laic), than in the modern societies, open to innovations and organised on democratic principles (the observing of individual rights and liberties, equality of citizens before the laws etc.).In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation is developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, is about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.( Stoiciu, G., Popescu, R., Caramalau, R., 2016, p.14)One of the most frequent forms of discrimination against women is met on the labour market, which we are going to examine, on three aspects: employment, wages and promotion to managerial positions.It its linguistic acceptations, the notion of discrimination has mainly a positive connotation. The verb to discriminate means to distinguish, to differentiate, the separate, to segregate, all these being considered synonyms. Therefore, the meaning is an ascertaining and descriptive one.In the political sciences field and law, the notion of discrimination is preponderantly referring to value and norm. It gains a major and imperative meaning, with a prophylactic and reparatory character, owing to the fact that the act of discrimination is evaluated in the social context as a reprovable, unequal, undesirable, rejecting action. The fact that there is explained by its usual reference to a real phenomenon, that of limitation, bullying, or infringement of the rights of a certain category of citizens (groups, minorities, populations), within a local or national community.Thus, through discrimination, there is ignored a moral value (the collective good) and infringed a law norm or principle (the equality of all the citizens before the law). In art. 16, called Equality in rights, from the Romanian Constitution, there are underlined the reasons of the mentioned principle: (1) All the citizens are equal before the law and public authorities, without privileges or discriminations; (2) Nobody is above the law; (3) The Romanian state guarantees the equality of chances between women and men [...] (The Romanian Constitution, art. 16).Since 2000, in our country, there has been adopted a legislation, specific for the official fight against discrimination. Thus, Ordinance no. 137/31st of August 2000 on the prevention and sanctioning of all forms of discrimination, starts from the principle of equality, which excludes the privileges and the discrimination in exercising the citizen rights. Moreover, is defined the notion of discrimination, through which it is understood any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference, based on race, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, social category, beliefs, sex, or sexual orientation, belonging to a disadvantaged category, or any other criterion that has as purpose or effect the restriction or the elimination of recognition, use or exercising, in conditions of equality, of the human rights and fundamental freedoms, or the rights recognised by the law, in the public, economic, social and cultural area, or in any other areas of the public life. …",

      "title": "Filth and Sexual Excess",
      "abstract": "&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Pornography can appear as a staid genre with a rigid series of rules and representations, each video consisting of a specified number of liaisons and pre-designated sexual acts, but it is also a genre that has developed and focused its numerous activities. What was considered to be an arousing taboo in the 1970s would not, for example, be considered as such today. Anal sex, while once comparatively rare in pornographic films, is now commonplace, and, while once utterly unspoken in mainstream heterosexual culture it is now acknowledged and celebrated, even by female targeted films such as Brigit Jones’ Diary (Sharon Maguire, 2001). Pornography, however, has raised the stakes again. Hardcore is dependent on so called ‘nasty girls’ and most interviews with starlets focus on their ability to enjoy being ‘nasty’, to enjoy what are considered or labelled as ‘perverse’ manifestations of sexuality by the normalising discourses of dominant culture and society. While once a porn star merely had to enjoy – or pretend to enjoy – sucking cock, now it is expected her repertoire will include a wider range of activities. With anal sex, an event that transpires in most modern pornography, the site of penises – either singularly or in pairs – pushed into swollen sore assholes is a visual commonplace. In the 1980s and 1990s (when the representation of heterosexual anal sex became truly dominant in pornography) there was a recognizable process of sexual acts, between penetration of mouth, vagina, and asshole. Each penetration would be edited and between each take the male star would wipe down his penis. Until somebody in hardcore pornography developed the A-to-M, a.k.a ass-to-mouth aka A2M. In this move the male pulls his cock from the asshole of the female and then sticks it straight into her open mouth and down her throat without wiping it clean first. All of this is presented unmediated to the viewer, in one singular shot that follows the penis as it moves from one willing hole to the other (and the body must be understood as fragmented, it is a collection of zones and areas, in this instance orifices each with their own signifying practices, not a singular organic whole). Even assuming that the nubile starlet has had an enema to blast clean her rectum prior to filming there will still be microscopic traces of her shit and rectal mucus on his penis. Indeed the pleasure for the viewers is in the knowledge of the authenticity of the movement between ass and mouth, in the knowledge that there will be small flakes of shit stuck to her lips and teeth (a variant of the ass-to-mouth sees the penis being pulled from one starlet’s anus and inserted into another starlet’s gaping mouth, again in one unedited shot). Shit escapes simple ontology it is opposed to all manner of being, all manner of knowledge and of existence yet it is also intimately linked to self-presence and continuity. From earliest infancy we are encouraged not to engage with it, rather it is that which is to be flushed away immediately, it is everything about being human that is repulsive, rejected and denied. Shit escapes simple symbolism; it exists in its own discursive zone. While death may be similarly horrific to us, it is so because it is utterly unknown shit, however, horrifies precisely because it is known to us. Like death, shit makes us all equal, but shit is familiar, we know its fragrance, we know its texture, we know its colour, and – yes – deep down, repressed in our animal brain we know its taste. Its familiarity results because it is a part of us, yet it is no longer of us. In death the cadaver can be theorized as the body without a soul, without spirit, or without personality, but with shit humanity does not have this luxury, shit is the part of us that both defies and defines humanity. Shit is that which was us but is no longer, yet it never fully stops being part of us, it contains traces of our genetic material, pieces of our diet, even as it is flushed more is already being pushed down our intestine. Shit is substance and process. If the act of fucking is that which affirms vital existence against death, then introducing shit into the equation becomes utterly transgressive. Defecation and copulation are antithetical St Augustine’s recognition that we are born between piss and shit – inter faeces et urinam – understands the animistic nature of existence and sex as contaminated by sin, but he does not conflate the act of shitting and fucking as the same, his description is powerful precisely because they are not understood as the same. Introducing shit into sexual activity is culturally forbidden, genuine scatologists, coprophiles and shit fetishists are rare, and most keep their desires secret even from their closest companions. Even the few that confess to enjoying ‘brown showers’ do not admit to eating raw shit, either their own or that of somebody else. The practice is considered to be too dangerous, too unhealthy, and too disgusting. Even amongst the radical sexual communities many find that it stinks of excess, as if desires and fantasies had limits. In Pier Paolo Pasolini’s cinematic masterpiece Salo (1975) the quartet of libertines and their fellow explorers in unleashed lust – both the willing and the coerced – indulge in a vast coprophilic feast, but in this film the shit that is slathered over the bodies of the young charges and greedily scoffed down is not real. However there are a handful of directly scatological pornographic videos, often they depict people crouching down and shitting, the shit being rubbed on to nude bodies and eventually consumed. In some videos hungry mouths open directly under the puckering asshole, allowing the brown turd to plop directly onto the enthusiastic tongue and into the mouth. Cameras zoom in to show the shit-smeared lips and teeth. Like the image of ejaculation manifested in the cum-shot of mainstream hardcore pornography this sight is a vindication of the authenticity of the action. Such videos are watched by both fetishists and the curious – commonly teenage males trying to out shock each other. Unlike ‘traditional’ heterosexual hardcore pornography, which depicts explicit penetrative sex, scatology films rarely appear on the shelves of video stores and enthusiasts are compelled to search the dark bowels of pornography to find them. Yet the popularity of the ass-to-mouth sequence in hardcore suggests that there is an interest with such faecal taboo acts that may be more common that previously imagined. This is not to suggest that the audience who witness an ass-to-mouth scene want to go and eat shit, or want their partners to, but it does suggest that there is an interest in the transgressive potential of shit or the idea of shit on an erect penis. Watching these scenes the audience’s attention is drawn to the movement from the locus of defecation to that of consumption. Perhaps the visual pleasure lies in the degradation of the ‘nasty’ girl, in the knowledge that she can taste her own mucus and faecal matter. But if the pleasures are purely sadistic then these films fail, they do not (just) depict the starlets ‘suffering’ as they engage in these activities, in contrast, they are ‘normalised’ into the sexual conventions of the form. Hardcore pornography is about the depiction of literal excess; about multiple penis plunging into one asshole or one vagina (or even both) about orgies about the world’s biggest gang bangs and facials in which a dozen or more men shoot their genetic material onto the grinning faces of starlets as cum slathers their forehead, cheeks, chin, lips, and teeth. The sheer unremitting quantity becomes an object in itself. Nothing can ever be enough. This excess is also philosophical; all non-reproductive sexual activity belongs to the category of excess expenditure, where the unrestrained pursuit of pleasure becomes in itself both object choice and subject. Some would see such pornographic activities as anti-humanist, as cold, and as nihilistic, but such an interpretation fails. In watching these films, in seeing the penis move from asshole to mouth the audience are compelled by the authenticity of the gesture to read the starlet as human the ‘pleasure’ is in knowing that she can taste her own shit on some anonymous cock. Finally, she is smiling through its musky taste so we do not have to. Appendix / Sources / Notes / Parallel Text Throughout this paper I am referring only to pornographic material marketed to an audience who are identified or identify as heterosexual. These films may contain scenes with multiple males and females having sex at one time, however while there may be what the industry refers to as girl-on-girl action there will be no direct male-on-male contact (although often all that seperates two male penises is the paper thin wall of fleshy tissue between the vagina and anus). The socio-cultural history of heterosexual anal sex is a complex one, made more so because of its illicit and, in some jurisdictions, illegal status. It is safe to assume that many people have engaged in it even if they have not subsequently undertaken an active interest in it (statistics published in Exploring the Dimensions of Human Sexuality 2nd Edition suggest that 28% of male and 24% of female American college graduates and 21% of male and 13% of female high school graduates have experienced anal sex [377]). In hardcore pornography it is the male who penetrates the female, who presents her asshole for the viewer’s delectation. In personal sexual behaviour heterosexual males may also enjoy anal penetration from a female partner both in order to stimulate the sensitive tissue around the anus and to stilulate the prostate, but the representation of such activities is very rare in the mainstream of American hardcore porn. As inventer of gonzo porn John Stagliano commented when interviewed about his sexual proclivities in The Other Hollywood , “…you know, admitting that I really wanted to get fucked in the ass, and might really like it, is not necessarily a socially acceptable thing for a straight man” (587). Anal sex was most coherently radicalised by the Marquis de Sade, the master of sodomaniacal literature, who understood penetrating male / penetrated female anal sex as a way in which erotic pleasure/s could be divorced from any reproductive metanarrative. The scene in Brigit Jones’ Diary is made all the more strange because there is no mention of safe sex. There are, however, repeated references and representations of the size and shape of the heroine’s buttocks and her willingness to acquiesce to the evidentially dominant will of her ‘bad’ boyfriend the aptly named Daniel Cleaver. For more on heterosexual anal sex in cinema see my ‘Hot, Hard Cocks and Tight, Tight Unlubricated Assholes.Transgression, Sexual Ambiguity and ‘Perverse’ Pleasures in Serge Gainsbourg’s Je T’Aime Moi Non Plus’, in Senses of Cinema 30 (Jan.-March 2004). Hardcore pornography commonly means that which features a depiction of penetrative intercourse and the visual presentation of male ejaculation as a climax to a sequence. For more on the contemporary porn scene and the ‘nasty girl’ see Anthony Petkovich, The X Factory: Inside The American Hardcore Film Industry, which contains numerous interviews with porn starlets and industry insiders. While pornography is remembered for a number of key texts such as Deep Throat (Gerard Damiano, 1972) or Behind the Green Door (Jim &amp; Artie Mitchell, 1972), these were shot and marketed as erotic narrative film and released theatrically (albeit to grindhouse and specialist cinemas). However since 1982 and the widespread availability of video – and more recently DVD – pornography has been produced almost exclusively for home consumption. The increasing demands of the consumer, combined with the accessablity of technology and cheap production costs of video when compared to film have led to a glut of available material. Now videos/DVDs are often released in series with absurdly self descriptive titles such as Anal Pounding, Lesbian Bukkake, and Pussy Party, most of which provide examples of the mise-en-scene of contemporary hardcore, specific ass to mouth series include Ass to Mouth (vol 1 – 15), Ass to Mouth CumShots (vol 1 – 5), Her First Ass to Mouth, From Her Ass to Her Mouth, From My Ass to My Mouth, A2M (vol 1 – 9), and no doubt many others. For more on hardcore pornography and its common themes and visual styles see Linda Williams, Hardcore. Wikipedia suggests that the director Max Hardcore was responsible for introducing the form in the early 1990s in his series Cherry Poppers. The act is now a staple of the form. (Note that while Wikipedia can not normally be considered an academic source the vagaries of the subject matter necessitate that research takes place where necessary). All pornographic positions and gestures have a nickname, industry shorthand, thus there are terms such as the DP (double penetration) or the reverse cowgirl. These names are no more or less shocking than the translations for sexual positions offered in ‘classic’ erotic guidebooks such as the Kama Sutra. This fragmented body is a result of the cinematic gaze of pornography. Lenses are able to zoom in and focus on the body, and especially the genitals, in minute detail and present the flesh enlarged to proportions that are impossible to see in actual sexual encounters. The body viewed under such scrutiny but devoid of singular organic plenitude echoes the body without organs of Deleuze and Guattari (in contrast some radical feminist writers such as Andrea Dworkin would merely interpret such images as reflecting the misogyny of male dominated discourse). For more on the psychological development of the infant and the construction of the clean and unclean see Julia Kristeva Powers of Horror. It should be noted that commonly those who enjoy enema play – klismaphiliacs – are not related to scatologists, and often draw a distinction between their play, which is seen as a process of cleansing, and scatologists’ play, which is understood to be a celebration of the physical shit itself. Salo has undergone numerous sanctions, been banned, scorned, and even been interpreted by some as a metaphor / allegory for the director’s subsequent murder. Such understandings and pseudo-explanations do not do justice to either the director or to his film and its radical engagement with de Sade’s literature. These videos always come from ‘elsewhere’ of course, never close to home, thus in Different Loving the authors note “the Germans seem to specialize in scat” (518). Correspondence concerning the infamous bestiality film Animal Farm (197?) in the journal Headpress (issues 15 and 16, 1998) suggested that the audience was made up from teenage males watching it as a rite of passage, rather than by true zoophiles. Those I have seen were on shock and ‘gross out’ Internet sites rather than pornographic sites. Disclaimer – I have no interest per se in scatology, but an ongoing interest with the vagaries of human thought, and desire in particular, necessarily involves exploring areas others turn their noses up at.

These he continually violates, through some unknown impelling force that makes him act in utter disregard of the good, safety and comfort or all. This latter violation is usually called crime. Now in all the mutations of the silent revolution that has wrought so wonderfully since the debut of an organized Christian civilization, we have room for so many different phases of a variation of progress that we have amid a high Christian civilization, great irregularities in which individuals are untrue to their assumed, acquired and inherited responsibilities and obligations, and tend frequently or constantly to violate those laws,",

Indeed, early differentiating genital ridges evolve into either of 2 very distinct organs: the testis or the ovary. Accumulating evidence now demonstrates that both genetic pathways must repress the other in order for the organs to differentiate properly, meaning that if this repression is disrupted or attenuated, the other pathway may completely or partially be expressed, leading to disorders of sex development. Among these disorders are the cases of XY male-to-female and XX female-to-male sex reversals as well as true hermaphrodites, in which there is a discrepancy between the chromosomal and gonadal sex. Here, we review known cases of XY and XX sex reversals described in mammals, focusing mostly on domestic animals where sex reversal pathologies occur and on wild species in which deviations from the usual XX/XY system have been documented.",

This sex difference appears to be real and not an artifact of response bias, patient behavior, or clinician bias. The higher rates of mental illness among women can be linked to aspects of their societal role and particularly to aspects of the marital role. Therapists who treat women whose mental illness is in part a response to the characteristics of conventional sex roles have no treatment alternatives that are not in some way problematic. The treatment alternative chosen has, in the broadest sense, political implications for the society at large.",

Not an inner need that seeks an outlet. The sensitivity of the sexual response system and interoceptive consciousness together determine the threshold for sexual desire. The first varies constantly, under the influence of dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and kisspeptin, among others. The interoceptive consciousness is vulnerable to personal and cultural beliefs about body and sexuality such as shame and guilt. Medicalisation of sexual desire turns these processes upside down. Intimacy, sensuality and erotic fantasy are not the result, but the cause of sexual desire. To promote sexual appetite, improving interoceptive consciousness is more effective than medication.",

      "abstract": "Female circumcision, or excision of the clitoris, is still practiced in many African countries. It does not have any religious significance, but it is a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood, and its function is to distinguish the sexes by the excision of the clitoris, which is the female counterpart of the male penis. The ritual is done in groups of girls aged 12-15 by an old woman and outside of the village; a big celebration follows the rite. Many tribes still consider the excision of the penis as a means to limit the sexual appetities of females, thereby guaranteeing fidelity to an often polygamous husband. Convalescence from the operation lasts 4-6 weeks, during which a girl is instructed about her future role as mother and wife. Consequences of female excision are infection, mainly tetanus, and hemorrhage; they both can lead to death. Other consequences are ugly deformations, mostly by occlusion of the vagina, dyspareunia and frigidity. Opposition to female excision is growing especially in urban areas, but it is still practiced by more than half of the population. Acceleration of female education together with health and sex education would certainly help speed up the eradication of such a barbarous practice.",

      "title": "Insights on asexuality – defining the fourth sexual orientation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Although the phenomenon of asexuality is not new – it was first mentioned in the 1950s, in the works of Kinsey et al. – it remained ignored and unstudied by the scientific community until Bogaert ignited new interest in this topic. In 2004, the author published his findings regarding the prevalence of asexuality and reported that 1.05% of the British population was asexual. Human asexuality is defined as a lack of sexual attraction to anyone or anything, either hetero or homosexual, although this definition is not consensual. Objectives/aims This work aims to review the conceptualization of asexuality, and the social, biologic and psychologic factors associated. Methods A review of relevant literature was conducted alongside online database research (PubMed and Medscape), using the keywords human and asexuality. Results Despite the fact that many approaches have been proposed to define asexuality (lack of sexual behavior, lack of sexual attraction, self-identification as asexual or a combination of the previous) there is growing evidence supporting the conceptualization of asexuality as a unique sexual orientation, thus representing a fourth category. It appears to be more frequent in women and associated to religiosity, lower education level, lower socioeconomic status, and poor health. Conclusions Despite the increased interest of the scientific community in the study of asexuality, many questions remain unanswered. Additional studies are crucial in order to provide a clear understanding and acceptance of asexuality in this highly sexualized and voyeuristic society we live in, and also to allow for a better understanding of the complexity of sexuality.",

      "title": "On intersexuality in the crayfish<i>Cherax quadricarinatus</i>: an inducible sexual plasticity model",
      "abstract": "Summary Sexual differentiation is a plastic process. The plasticity may be manifested during embryo-genesis, when one set of primordial reproductive ducts develops while the other degenerates. In adults, many normal (e.g., sequential hermaphroditism) and abnormal (e.g., endocrine disorders or exposure to endocrine disrupters such as estrogenic pollutants) cases are known in which sexual plasticity may be expressed as various degrees of feminization. In crustaceans, the androgenic gland (AG) regulates the development of male characteristics; its absence results in feminization, often including the onset of vitellogenesis. A unique model of intersexuality was found in the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, in which some degree of natural sexual plasticity is observed. Two to 14% of the population are intersex individuals, having both male and female genital openings. Intersex specimens always function as males but may also contain an ovary in a permanently arrested, pre-vitellogenic state. This sexual plasticity model was recently characterized and investigated with respect to the role of the AG and the onset of vitellogenesis. Removal of the AG in intersex individuals induced the reproductive system to shift from a permanently active male state to a female state. This shift included changes in morphology, cessation of spermatogenesis and onset of secondary vitellogenesis manifested by a change in the ovarian protein profile, translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) in the ovary and appearance of secondary vitellogenic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the hemolymph. The vitellogenin gene was found to be induced in the hepatopancreas of AG ablated intersex individuals suggesting that the AG represses transcription of this gene in intact intersex individuals. The experimentally inducible sex shift in the crayfish provides a unique and controlled model system for the study of sexual differentiation and plasticity at the physiological and molecular levels. The findings presented here also illustrate the central role of the AG in the regulation of sexual differentiation in sexually plastic as well as gonochoristic crustacean species.",

With the rapid growth in height that occurs in adolescence, all the earlier faults are made more apparent, even when they are not greatly increased in actual physical proportions. At this time, too, parents generally become much more aware of the physical appearance of their child than they were during his earlier years. This increased awareness of parents is based on many factors: the child's appearance in the more formal clothing demanded by his increasing social life; his greatly increased size, with the corresponding increase in any deformity which he may have; his lack of skill in managing his suddenly enlarged body and its members, and, most of all, their startled realization that the child can no longer be counted on to outgrow his undesirable physical traits and that these, in fact,",

      "abstract": "Incest taboos should be seen as involving non‐sexual objections to sexual relations, that is, objections based on who people are in relation to each other, rather than their activities. What is at stake is brought out by considering certain objections to father‐daughter incest and certain features of taboos. The objections that matter do not depend on social ties and distinctions having a biological basis, but there is nonetheless a biological element in incest taboos. To see it, one must look to the nature of the Oedipus complex, and to the conditions for the development of the individual and of society. There may be prohibitions which are necessary (to morality, to society, to humanity) even though they may not be justifiable within a narrower conception (e.g. utilitarian) of morality and justification. And so taboos which are universal (occur, in one form or another, in every society), and absolute (allow no questioning), and impose strict liability (allow no excuse), may not be irrational: they may mark the boundaries that shape a way of life.",

      "title": "Visual impairment across the lifespan: neuropsychological perspectives",
      "abstract": "Vision is often an essential capacity for the interaction between individuals and their environment. Yet, for some individuals, an impaired visual system alters that opportunity. Visual loss can be lifelong, present from birth; for others, it can be progressive or abrupt. For some individuals, particularly those who lose vision later in life, the loss of vision is associated with a corresponding loss of independence, and impact on their emotional status. A lifespan perspective regarding visual impairment (VI) holds that the experience of VI since birth or early childhood is qualitatively different from the experience of individuals who acquire VI later in life. For example, in early childhood, VI impacts psychomotor and cognitive development that relies upon visual information processing and places challenges on the educational system, which must provide appropriate supports. In contrast, when acquired later in life, VI may place challenges on the ability to complete tasks of daily living, be independent, and engage in leisure activities, but not affect learning status or how knowledge is shared.",

      "title": "Restoring Lives: Developmental Research on Sexual Orientation",
      "abstract": "When I first started reading the psychological literature on homosexuality nearly 25 years ago, several omissions were painfully evident.On the positive side, studies were no longer focusing on whether or not lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were mentally disordered; their minds had been rescued from psychopathology with the 1973 removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental disorders.However, the literature I read about 'homosexuals' described people who seemed to spring from nowhere, that is, they were never children or adolescents, and did not seem to have siblings, parents, or grandparents.Nothing in the literature at the time alluded to long-term relationships, or even important friendships.The implicit portrait was of an adult homosexual person, almost always a male, living in a metropolitan area on his own (although having sex on a regular basis -this was not left out!).Although they now had their mental health restored, they still did not have lives.In essence, what was missing was any focus on their development -over their lifetimes in relationship to others, in distinct social circumstances, and at particular historical moments.For example, in the early 1980s, there were no lesbian or gay adolescents in the professional literature.The gerontological literature did not contain older adults who were lesbian or gay.Research on families did not include samesex couples or lesbian, gay, or bisexual parents.Helping to finish this fractured portrait was the problematic methodology used in early studies.Although samples were no longer drawn from clinical settings, researchers used small samples found in a limited set of urban gay venues, and were conducted with a model of sexual orientation that had two boxes, gay or heterosexual.(The bisexual box was added later, and the transgendered person -a new gender -would not appear in the psychological literature until the 21st century.)The psychological findings were decontextualized.Research never included such profoundly important factors as the widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation that sealed many in their 'closets,' the harassment and violence that made fear a normative aspect of daily existence, nor even the fact that their private sexual behavior was illegal in most parts of the country.It was remarkable to me that researchers could make generalizations.",

Here we use cross-cultural approach to find out whether some traits could be labelled as highly prevalent or nearly universal. We further employed comparative perspective to analyze whether these traits are unique in humans or whether they are shared with our evolutionary relatives. This led us to formulate eight broad spheres which are reported cross-culturally. These include 1) building long-term sexual relationships and expected or enforced sexual exclusivity; 2) sexual activities not restricted to fertile period and 3) prevalent through the year which suggest other than reproductive functions of the sex in humans; 4) in contrast to chimpanzees attractiveness is relatively stable across the cycle; 5) humans appear to be the only species with exclusive male homosexual orientation; 6) similarly, presence of menopause is unique to human females, which was linked to relatively risky delivery and extreme altriciality of human children; and finally, 7) humans do not commonly perform sexual activities in the presence of others.

Ces techniques présentent en outre la particularité de posséder des fonctions latentes qui contrarient à divers degrés leurs fonctions manifestes. Monstrueuses à plus d'un titre, les techniques paradoxales, plus encore que par leur inefficacité pratique, se signalent par une efficacité sociale qui s'appuie précisément sur leur caractère limitant : ce caractère est valorisé et accentué aux limites du possible, jusqu'à ce qu'une modification des mentalités et/ou de la structure sociale vienne parfois bouleverser leur reproduction.",

Compared with other mammals of equivalent weights, gestation is long, lactation is long, and the juvenile period is long. Thus the minimal generation time is about 20 months for a marmoset smaller than a laboratory rat, 4 years for a typical Old World monkey the size of a dog, perhaps 10 or 12 years for a great ape. Nor does maturation cease with sexual maturity: increasingly, it is ber:oming clear that interaction patterns, the role, of adult primates of either sex continues to change for many years (e.g. Sackett and Ruppenthal 1973). This is not necessarily a peculiarity of primates, however; social maturation probably continues beyond sexual maturity in other social mammals. We can, of course, make cross-sectional descriptions of social development, obtaining means and ranges of such measures as time spent in contact with mother, or frequency of maternal intervention in interactions between infants and others at particular ages. This method can be extended relatively easily to infants develop-",

In the elderly there is a progressive decline of organic functions; the decrease of sexual and procreating activity is linked with the impaired male hormonal production. The four stages of sexual function are modified: 1. delayed erection; 2. plateau prolongation; 3. orgasm modifications; 4. fast penis detumescence. In addition to organic impairment, aesthetic, social, environmental and psychological factors can restrict sexual activity, as well as past sexual experiences and co-morbidity. There are specific aspects concerning sexuality in the elderly, such as the increased chances of public relations and emotional involvement, the more intense psychic activity and the stronger process of removal and sublimation of impulses. In conclusion the best way to deal with sexuality in the elderly is the multidimensional assessment.",

Esta ligazon tambien se ha demostrado en situaciones sociales relacionadas con la agresion interpersonal y que los seres humanos tienden a tomar decisiones mas agresivas en funcion del placer resultante. El objetivo de este estudio fue comprobar si esta tendencia se observa tambien en reclusos. Los resultados son similares a los observados en sujetos “normales” si bien el grado de hedonismo es mas alto en los reclusos. No se encontraron diferencias de edad ni sexo. Concluimos que cuanto mas agresiva es la conducta mas placentera es para el agresor, con la excepcion de los niveles mas elevados de agresividad. Esta tendencia se observa tanto en sujetos “normales” como en reclusos, aunque es mas fuerte en estos ultimos.[ABSTRACT]Maximization of pleasure (hedonicity) is a major mechanism in human decision-making, as previous research on both hoth sensory pleasure and purely mental pleasure. In addiction, it has also documented that pleasure is a major factor in decision-making in social situations related to interpersonal aggression, and that people tend to make aggressive behavioural decisions as a function of the resulting pleasure. The present study tried to verify whether this trend was also found in inmates. The results were similar to the ones previously observed in ‘normal’ subjects, even though the degree of hedonicity was higher in the prisoners. No sex nor age differences were found. We conclude that increasingly aggressive behavior is increasingly pleasurable to the aggressor, whith the exception of the highest levels of aggression. This trend is found in both ‘normal’ and inmate populations, even if it seems to be stronger in prisoners.",

In fact, we argue, this long-standing assumption is wrong. We review evidence that women's fertile-phase sexuality differs in a variety of ways from their sexuality during infertile phases of their cycles. In particular, when fertile in their cycles, women are particularly sexually attracted to a variety of features that likely are (or, ancestrally, were) indicators of genetic quality. As women's fertile-phase sexuality shares with other vertebrate females' fertile-phase sexuality a variety of functional and physiological features, we propose that the term oestrus appropriately applies to this phase in women. We discuss the function of women's non-fertile or extended sexuality and, based on empirical findings, suggest ways that fertile-phase sexuality in women has been shaped to partly function in the context of extra-pair mating. Men are particularly attracted to some features of fertile-phase women, but probably based on by-products of physiological changes males have been selected to detect, not because women signal their cycle-based fertility status.",

      "abstract": "Problem behavior may be defined as behavior that is socially defined as a problem, a source of concern, or as undesirable by the norms of conventional society and the institutions of adult authority, and its occurrence usually elicits some kind of social control response. Key elements of problem behavior are: (1) problem behaviors are rare until early adolescence; (2) the rate then climbs to a peak level; (3) thereafter the problem behavior becomes less frequent for the remainder of the lifespan (unless it ceases to be seen as a problem behavior), and (4) the timing of these trends is different for different problem behaviors in respects such as the typical age of initiation and the rate and timing of decline. Problem behavior varies with age because of social norms that children be given increasing independelice as they grow older. At each age, tl'ose adolescents who are less closely supervised are more likely to engage in problem behavior. Also relevant to this point is research that time spent socializing with peers in informal settings, away from adult supervision, is related to problem behavior. The question that remains is whether the relationship between independence and problem behavior, combined with the similarity in their age trends, is sufficient to account for age trends in problem behavior.

      "abstract": "Concepts of sexuality based on the physical sex of partners limit the way in which human sexuality is conceived and investigated. The shift in focus of inquiry from the sexual identity of individuals to the structure of their sexual relationships is an important step towards exploding concepts that, for the most part, have been severely restricted to male-female genital distinctions. This article argues that the genital organs are not the prime focus of sexual attraction. Careful studies may reveal that sexual arousal is based on criteria that transcend genital categories. To determine the basis of sexual attraction it is important to investigate an amalgam of characteristics--those related and unrelated to the partners' physical sex. There are indications that individuals with a greater mix of feminine and masculine characteristics (both mental and physical) are actually more arousing than those who fall closer to the stereotypes. The arts, it is suggested, have exploited this phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Women in much of the world lack support for fundamental functions of a human life. They are less well nourished than men, less healthy, more vulnerable to physical violence and sexual abuse. They are much less likely than men to be literate, and still less likely to have preprofessional or technical education. Should they attempt to enter the workplace, they face greater obstacles, including intimidation from family or spouse, sex discrimination in hiring, and sexual harassment in the workplace – all, frequently, without effective legal recourse. Similar obstacles often impede their effective participation in political life. In many nations women are not full equals under the law: they do not have the same property rights as men, the same rights to make a contract, the same rights of association, mobility, and religious liberty. Burdened, often, with the “double day” of taxing employment and full responsibility for housework and child care, they lack opportunities for play and for the cultivation of their imaginative and cognitive faculties. All these factors take their toll on emotional well-being: women have fewer opportunities than men to live free from fear and to enjoy rewarding types of love – especially when, as often happens, they are married without choice in childhood and have no recourse from bad marriages. In all these ways, unequal social and political circumstances give women unequal human capabilities.",

      "abstract": "A growing body of research attests to the impact of welfare regimes on health and health equity. However, the mechanisms that link different kinds of welfare entitlement to health outcomes are less well understood. This study analysed the accounts of 29 older adults in England to delineate how the form of entitlement to welfare and other resources (specifically, whether this was understood as a universal entitlement or as targeted to those in need) impacts on the determinants of health. Mechanisms directly affecting access to material resources (through deterring uptake of benefits) have been well documented, but those that operate through psychosocial and more structural pathways less so, in part because they are more challenging to identify. Entitlement that was understood collectively, or as arising from financial or other contributions to a social body, had positive impacts on wellbeing beyond material gains, including facilitating access to important health determinants: social contact, recognition and integration. Entitlement understood as targeted in terms of individualised concepts of need or vulnerability deterred access to material resources, but also fostered debate about legitimacy, thus contributing to negative impacts on individual wellbeing and the public health through the erosion of social integration. This has important implications for both policy and evaluation. Calls to target welfare benefits at those in most need emphasise direct material pathways to health impact. We suggest a model for considering policy change and evaluation which also takes into account how psychosocial and structural pathways are affected by the nature of entitlement.",

Unconscious biases permeate society at three fundamental levels—individual, institutional, and societal. Institutional bias surfaces when policies and procedures at academic institutions and in the workplace sustain practices that put women at a disadvantage. Institutional biases can affect men as well, but in many instances these practices disproportionately affect women. Societal bias has to do with ingrained beliefs and assumptions about preferences and abilities (those based on gender in this instance) that govern a society's norms and help shape its culture. They are systemic in nature and as such can have a powerful influence on behavior. Institutional policies, such as family leave and spousal accommodation, attempt to mitigate some of the issues women face by providing a forum for dialogue, specifically about work-life issues.",

They were presented with a series of sexually contrasted pairs of slides (heterosexual content paired with homosexual content) in a binocular device.

Selected criteria include territoriality, diet, reproduction, social status and the possibility of expressing natural behavior. Each criterion is scored from 1 to 10. It is evident that the maximum index of well-being (50) is allocated to stray animals, and the lowest (17-20) to pets. Between these two categories are farm animals with the index ranging from 21 - 25. In the worst position are pets who , by humans, are not considered to be sources of material gain but rather stand on the other end of emotional relationship. According to relevant criteria, limitations imposed on pets are usually more senseless then production and technology- related limitations to farm animals. As social interactions take place primarily at the level of individuals of different and not of the same species, human attitudes and not naturally behaved same-species animals have strong influence on behavior of pets. Sometimes, as a natural consequence, various ethological issues are created to additionally affect pets’ welfare. Key words: welfare, animals",

People with an intellectual disability generally have lower levels of sexual knowledge than those without an intellectual disability, and sexual exploration and expression is frequently viewed with concern by mental health care practitioners and caregivers, who may regard people with an intellectual disability as being ‘nonsexual’ or ‘hypersexual’. However, the rights of people with an intellectual disability to sexual expression have been established in policy and legislation. Service providers are required at times to make determinations regarding the ability of people with an intellectual disability to consent to sexual intercourse in a number of health care settings. There is a dearth of published literature on psychometric instruments to assess sexual knowledge and consent capacity. This article briefly reviews the more commonly used sexual knowledge and consent assessments for people with mild to moderate intellectual disability and advances recommendations in this regard.",

However, flexibility could also be a source of stress, as the responsibility to synchronize the two spheres is left to the individual. In either case, flexibility might have important effects on gender equality.The aim of this article is to explore the effect of flexible working time on work/family conflict as well as on other aspects of life outside the workplace. Data comes from a sample of Swedish employees in healthcare, manufacturing and finance (n = 1836). The results show that flexible working hours has positive effects on the ability to meet friends and relatives and to engage in hobbies, but does not reduce work/family conflict. However the degree of flexibility is also important: a high degree of flexibility increases work/family conflict, as this flexibility comes with a higher position and presumes an adjustment of working time to the needs of the organisation. In sum, the beneficial effects of flexible working hours could be called into question as long as flexibility is conditioned on high demands from the organisation.",

Beside the psychological obstacles connected with the fear of ‘‘playing God\" and the awe with which we hold the process of the creation of human beings, there are three philosophical problems which are the main subject of the article: 1. The logical problem of circularity: the morality of experimenting on embryos is dependent on the status of the embryo, which in turn is partly decided by experimentation. 2. The metaphysical problem: experiments are justified by the benefits they bring to human subjects; but it is doubtful whether an early embryo is a ‘‘subject\" and whether coming into being is a ‘‘benefit\". 3. The moral problem: the standard constraint on medical experiments is that they benefit either the individual subject or at least members of a relevantly defined group of patients suffering from the same syndrome. But embryo experimentation is often associated with potential cure to people of a completely different category (like geriatric patients). Finally, the article discusses the limits of the force of philosophical arguments in the formation of actual policies for regulating such practices as experimenting with embryos. The widely‐shared fourteen‐day limit is shown to be a sound practical compromise despite the difficulties in justifying it philosophically.",

Rather, here it is the marked deviation from the mean towards the ‘non-masculine’ or ‘feminine’ extreme.

Gay and lesbian people sometimes accommodated themselves in the available structures by shaping their relationships to “pass” as straight, or by unhappily conforming to marriage norms in other ways. Many, at least in recent times, have found ways to live outside of marriage, and as such are not alone. As we saw in Chapter 3, historically, transsexuals and intersexual people have also been barred from entry to marriage (along with “epileptics” and “lunatics,” among others). While such people were prohibited, in effect, from ever trying to enter conjugal territory, others were routinely deported from within it for failing to meet various standards of matrimonial civility—drunkards, criminals, and adulterers, for example. It could be argued that a need to reject the objectionable company kept by gay and lesbian people outside the matrimonial gates has outweighed the questionable desirability of the destination on the other side. Most of these excluded others could, of course, reenter after a time, and in most places are no longer restricted at all. Similarly, while cohabitants also dwell beyond certified marriage, they are nonetheless situated at its edges, and can, if they choose, enter at any time.",

      "title": "Multiple dimensions of social motivation in adult female degus",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many animals become more motivated to interact after a period of isolation. This phenomenon may involve general drives, e.g. for social touch or companionship, as well as drives that are specific to particular peers, and which ultimately serve to reestablish relationships between the individuals. Female degus are known to be affiliative with multiple other individuals, including unrelated and unfamiliar conspecifics, offering an opportunity to study social motivation independent from exclusive pair-bonds or overt, same-sex competition. We attempted to disentangle factors driving peer interaction by examining reunion behavior across several social isolation and separation manipulations. High levels of interaction were observed between adult females who had been separated even without isolation, revealing a drive to re-establish relationships with specific peers. The content of separation-only reunions differed from isolation, with the latter involving more early-session interaction, higher levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing, and a higher ratio of chitter vocalizations. To assess whether post-isolation behavior was related to stress, we examined reunions following a non-social (footshock) stressor. Like isolation, footshock increased early-session interactions, but did not increase allogrooming before rear-sniffing or chittering, as compared with controls. To test whether separation-only reunion behavior shared qualities with relationship formation, we also examined reunions of new (stranger) dyads. Strangers exhibited higher levels of interaction than cagemates, with particularly high levels of late-session rear-sniffing. Like separation-only reunions, strangers showed more non-chitter vocalizations and lower levels of allogrooming before rear-sniffing. Across experiments, an exploratory clustering method was used to identify vocalizations that differed between conditions. This yielded promising leads for future investigation, including a chaff-type syllable that may have been more common during relationship renewal. Overall, results are consistent with the hypothesis that female degu reunions are supported by both general and peer-stimulus specific drives, expressed through the structure of physical and vocal interactions over time.",

The severity, legal and/or social impact and lived experiences, thus, are unique to each single case of marital captivity. The acquired social and legal status of ‘married’ or ‘divorcee’ are not merely expressions and conﬁrmations of one's legal identity, but they are also social constructions that continuously shape an individual's social identity and status. A limping personal status or having the status of being legally and or religiously married thus aﬀects the way in which individuals navigate through their social environment and interact with their community members. Consequently, the unsettled marital status of a trapped spouse may produce unnecessary restrictions for their eﬀective participation in social and community life and it may impair their personal development. So long as the still existing (religious) marriage has signiﬁcant legal and/or social signiﬁcance, it will continue to undermine the trapped spouse(s)’ ability and capacity to autonomously shape their lives. The autonomy of a trapped spouse, or rather the lack thereof, is the main and recurring deprivation in all situations of marital captivity.",

Many of the experiments are of limited value as they: (i) fail to compare condition dependence in sexual ornaments with suitable non-sexual trait controls; (ii) do not adequately account for body size variation; and (iii) typically consider no stress and extreme stress manipulations rather than a range of stresses similar to those experienced in nature. There is also a dearth of experimental studies investigating the genetic basis of condition dependence. Despite the common claim that sexual ornaments are condition-dependent, the unexpected conclusion from our literature review is that there is little support from well-designed experiments.",

Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The group that experienced a physical illness formed an exception, showing more supportive and active sibling ties, but also higher levels of conflict. Results suggest inequality between persons who have experienced negative life events and those who have not in terms of access to positive and supportive sibling relationships.",

      "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO) creates a strong urge to stay continuously connected and informed about peers’ activities, identified as a risk factor for problematic social media use and risky behaviors. Sexting is generally defined as the exchange of sexually suggestive or explicit photos, videos, or text messages through cell phones or other technologies. Despite its social relevance, the link between FoMO and sexting remains underexplored. This study examines their relationship in young adults—an understudied group compared to adolescents—while controlling for age, sex, and sexual orientation. The study surveyed 911 Italian young adults (18–30 years, Mage = 22.3, SDage = 2.57, 74% women, 70.4% heterosexual) through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that FoMO predicts only risky sexting behaviors (sexting under substance use and sexting for emotion regulation) while not influencing experimental sexting (sending one’s own sexts). Additionally, the link between FoMO and sexting for emotion regulation is stronger among LGB individuals. Therefore, FoMO has proven to be strongly related to the two kinds of risky sexting but not to experimental sexting. Understanding this relationship can inform prevention and intervention programs on relationships, online communication, and sexting in young adults.",

Sexual health is also important to address for individuals from gender and sexual minority groups, who report sexual health needs after cancer but may differ in their experiences and preferences for support. Conversations about sexual function should occur with patients with advanced disease or at the end of life just as for patients diagnosed with early stage disease.

This chapter reviews the evidence as to how these various factors contribute to a range of specific behaviors that differ on average for males and females across the life span, including toy and activity preferences; core gender identity; sexual orientation; verbal, mathematical, and spatial abilities; and aggression and empathy. Although many types of factors are involved in the development of each of these gender-related behavioral outcomes, the specific factors involved appear to differ from one outcome to another. Thus, the development of differences in behavior between males and females, as well as individual variability within each sex in gendered behavior, is multi-determined.",

Then the congestion either is ignored or not interpreted as sexual. An anhedonic or even a dysphoric response to the sensations of genital congestion are further possibilities. This model allows for various subtypes of arousal disorder and thus facilitates a choice of therapeutic intervention.",

Existen varios mitos y estereotipos en torno a la sexualidad de las personas con discapacidad; la misma gente es capaz de mermar drásticamente la expresión sexual de estas personas, como pensar que son asexuales y que dependen de los demás. También existe una devaluación de la percepción corporal que dificulta apreciarse como un sujeto sexualmente atractivo. A esto se suman otros factores que pueden ser considerados un obstáculo para la vida sexual, como el dolor, el uso de fármacos, incontinencia urinaria o fecal, la dificultad para adoptar ciertas posiciones para realizar el coito e incluso el temor a la muerte. Es indudable que la vida sexual de las personas discapacitadas tiene una especificidad, bien en sí misma, bien por las condiciones en que pueden vivirla. Cada discapacidad supone una cierta especificidad en la forma de vivir la sexualidad, cada discapacitado y cada contexto familiar y social también, los discapacitados tienen posibilidades y formas muy diferentes de vivir la sexualidad. Las personas con discapacidad, son personas sexuales y tienen un amplio rango de necesidades emocionales y sexuales y los mismos problemas que las personas con cuerpos hábiles.

Transgender is used\nhere as an umbrella term to denote a diversity of identities that challenge the binary categories of male and female and which may (or may\nnot) relate to body modifications through the use of hormones or surgical procedures. Transgender practices include movement across (e.g.,\ntranssexual reassignment from male-to-female or female-to-male),\nbetween (e.g., male or female drag), or beyond (e.g., gender queer)\ngender categories and challenge the understanding of the terms sex and\ngender as biologically fixed. Additionally, transgender practices problematize a straightforward correlation between “sex” and “gender,”\nraising complex questions about how these categories are constructed.\nAlthough these issues have long been central to feminist thought, on a\ntheoretical, political, and cultural level, second wave feminism has been\nlargely hostile to transgender practices. Trans women (i.e., born men)have been seen to reinforce stereotypical femininity, while trans men\n(i.e., born women) have been viewed as renegades seeking to acquire\nmale power and privilege. In 1998, Stephen Whittle posed the question,\n“How can feminism accept men with women’s bodies (or is that\nwomen with men’s bodies)?”2 Whittle’s question remains central to\nfeminist debates and the controversial relationship between transgender and feminism.",

The experience has often been described in literature, and in recent years has been the object of extensive gerontological research under the label ‘life review’. Such memories often include a reversal of judgment about a past act, relationship, event, etc. What earlier was judged to be so is, in the retrospect of late life, judged not to have been so after all. This presents a question: which judgment—the earlier or the later—has better epistemological credentials in such cases? Some obvious possible answers are considered and rejected. It would seem that the issue is not resolvable on epistemological grounds. A parallel dilemma seems to appear in other dimensions of experience. An example from aesthetic experience is briefly considered.",

      "title": "Are positive emotions reliable indicators of welfare in horses?",
      "abstract": "Assessing horse welfare is a crucial issue for obvious ethical reasons but also because it has been shown to have an impact on reproductive and cognitive abilities. Welfare also affects the relationship of horses with humans both at work and outside work; it enhances security for people and thus it constitutes a social issue too. Studies combining behavioural, postural, physiological and sanitary data suggest that it is possible to identify and validate indicators of altered welfare but also of well-being, that is, of a positive affective state. Although it has been proposed that positive affective states could arise from the sum of positive emotions experienced daily, the link between these short term experiences and the chronic state that characterizes the welfare state is not clear yet. Indeed, emotions are short-lived affective reactions but do not necessary depict the chronic state of the animal. Moreover, identifying expressions of positive emotions remains more difficult than identifying those of negative emotions. Also discriminate valence (positive/negative) from intensity (high/low) when measuring emotions is both necessary and delicate. For example, adult play or anticipatory behaviours may not have the same valence if one considers the short term or the chronic affective state but are both of high intensity. On the other hand, other low intensity indicators of positive emotions emerge that might be better candidates for revealing a “well-being” state. The aim of this review is to propose a critical view of measuring short experienced positive emotions, evaluating their interest for welfare assessment and present novel perspectives of investigation through behavioural and electrophysiological recordings.",

In the majority of cases, impotence reflects a global psychological dysfunction. Psychogenic impotents are most of the time inferiorized subjects alledging organic or other non justified factors to their disorder. Generally, they are peaceful, obsessive, often hypothymic; they express disgust for the body, suffer various somatic dysfunctions due to the sexual stasis; they have difficulties in communicating with things and beings. As compared to erective impotents, it seems that the global impotents have a more rigid father, are among the younger sibblings and have more brothers and sisters.

      "title": "Older Adults Acceptability of Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Engagement in recommended levels of physical activity decreases dramatically with age, despite many health and social benefits. Effective implementation of physical activity services for older adults requires that such provision is acceptable to them. Older adults living in deprived areas, where lack of resources can result in unmet basic needs, are twice as likely to be inactive as those in more affluent areas, suggesting lower levels of acceptability of leisure time physical activity. Older adults with lower socioeconomic status also experience greater barriers to physical activity yet are often omitted from research. \nAcceptability is often conceptualised as the level of tolerance required to undertake health behaviours in order to gain future health-related benefits. As many older adults may view physical activity as irrelevant, a waste of limited resources, or a luxury that only the well, or well-off, can indulge in, an alternative approach may be more fitting. The term acceptability can also be used to denote how attractive health behaviours are perceived to be to the target audience, and whether or not they are actively sought out. When viewed through this lens, physical activity may be seen as an enjoyable way to spend time connecting with others, whilst still reaping the many benefits for health and wellbeing. \nThis PhD aimed to address the gap in knowledge on the role acceptability of physical activity plays in the engagement in physical activity by older adults and to explore the impact of socioeconomic factors on such acceptability. A meta-synthesis was conducted to identify underlying reasons older adults have for wanting to engage in physical activity (or not). Few data were found from low socioeconomic status areas. The impact of providers views on acceptability were rarely considered in the literature. A multi-perspective interview study was therefore conducted within low socioeconomic status areas to explore acceptability of physical activity in this context. Views on what made physical activity acceptable to older adults (with reasons for such acceptability) were elicited both from older adults in low socioeconomic status areas and from providers of physical activity programmes in these locations. This study resulted in two papers, one published paper on the conflation of time and energy from the older adults' perspective, and one paper (in preparation) on the wider multi-perspective views of older adults and providers on the acceptability of physical activity. A published book chapter giving an overview of how to implement these findings to make physical activity interventions more acceptable to older adults completes this research. \nFocusing on fun and enjoyment rather than long-term health outcomes within physical activity services does appear more acceptable to many older adults. Actively encouraging socialising by providing time and space around and within physical activity increases the value to many and may be particularly important in deprived areas where there may be limited other opportunities for socialising. Providers may need to think outside their remit or work collaboratively with those from other sectors to achieve this multi-functional physical activity/social provision in order to encourage older adults in deprived areas into what could otherwise be an unfamiliar concept, leisure time physical activity. Encouraging socialising within physical activity can be an effective use of limited resources, increasing acceptability of physical activity as a by-product of satisfying highly valued social needs.",

The demarcation of masculine and feminine domains, the desire of one sex for the other, and the institutions charged with legitimizing both, become the amusing foils or dire impasses that comprise the action and envelop the characters of the plays of this era. Other cultural concerns are neither ignored nor dismissed; rather, the social, political, historical, and personal are imagined and played out primarily through this narrow dramatic focus. Gender, sexuality, and marriage emerge as comically or tragically disordered states whose permutations must be worked through in order to achieve personal goals, to consolidate families, to re-establish social order, to restore political stability, and to secure cultural cohesion. The reliance on such constricted and redundant dramatic tropes is rare if not unique in English theatrical history.",

      "abstract": "Functional gonads are mandatory for sexual reproduction and survival of higher animal species. However, at the level of the individual subject, acquired or inherited gonadal dysfunction and infertility are not commonly associated with severe life-threatening phenotypes. Medical progress and increased societal interest have led to more prioritised agendas for reproductive health problems. Increasing attention is focused on disorders of sex development, fertility and sexual function. Despite this engagement, our understanding of the detailed molecular and cellular adverse events behind such problems is still incomplete. Critical early steps, such as determination of the gonads, occur at precise temporal windows of development. The sex chromosomes are obvious critical contributors, but many other human chromosomes also contribute to sex differentiation, engaging multiple genes and proteins. The aim of this review is to give an up-to-date and comprehensive summary of the events required for gonadal ontogenesis in the human male, from the stage of embryonic sex determination to postnatal maturation including puberty. The principal genes involved in these processes are tabulated and discussed. Morphological events relevant for human gonadal development are covered, in particular in connection with early germ cell maturation and spermatogenesis. Consequences of maldevelopment caused by, e.g. cryptorchidism, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "What is the nature of eroticism? What is the role of eroticism in sexual interaction? The answers to these questions are explored as are their implications for the understanding and treatment of sexual desire problems. To the extent that sexuality has typically been defined in the sex therapy literature in terms of a pattern of physiological and observable, behavioral events, the phenomenology of erotic experience has been overlooked. Eroticism involves the intent to contact and arouse another. The erotic experience is to be found with a partner who values enhancing sexual pleasure for each other for its own sake rather than as a means to a goal, for example, tension release, orgasm, intercourse. The erotic encounter involves the shared exploration of sexual wishes, dreams, and fantasies. It is argued that eroticism is a central component in the maintenance of sexual desire. The absence of eroticism is linked to the prevalence of chronic sexual dissatisfaction and inhibited sexual desire among those who are otherwise fully functional. The taboos surrounding sexual arousal and the seeking of sexual pleasure are examined. The value of eroticism for the individual and the couple is discussed in terms of deepening of self-knowledge, self-affirmation, mutual trust, and intimacy. Implications for clinicians are addressed. A shift in paradigms is recommended from the prevailing one, focusing on sexual function versus dysfunction, to another that emphasizes the potential for sharing erotic experience.",

Our study comprised intellectually gifted (n = 96) and averagely intelligent (n = 91) adults who filled out the 'Overexcitability Questionnaire-Two'. We found no statistically significant interaction of 'giftedness × sex'. Women (regardless of their intellectual status) scored statistically significantly higher than gifted and non-gifted men on emotional as well as sensual overexcitability. With regard to the factor 'giftedness', gifted individuals displayed a statistically significantly higher intellectual overexcitability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Substance use, often in combination with sex, referred to as “party and play (PNP),” defines lives of gay men across generations and across all stages of life. Alcohol and drug use among gay men is precipitated by psychosocial burdens such as loneliness and diminished self-worth, the mental health difficulties experienced within the population, and the physical challenges associated with sex itself. The reliance on drug use is catalyzed by the homophobia of American society, but is also normalized within the community itself. The use of alcohol and other drugs also is intimately linked to the expectations of masculinity within the gay population, the drive for physical and sexual perfection, and the racism and discrimination experienced by gay men both within and outside the gay community. Ultimately, drugs serve as facilitators for the fantastical sex sought by many gay men and thus use of noninjection drugs that are hypersexualizing, such as methamphetamine and inhalant nitrates, has been implicated in the ongoing presence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the gay population.",

      "abstract": "Gay men's communities, social networks, and strategic action fields consider the interconnectivity of gay men. These concepts are discussed. Overall the concern is to describe how gay men coalesce, engage in concerted action, and experience categorical oppression. We can realistically speak of separate, somewhat overlapping, communities of gay men or gay men's communities encompassing territory (the gay ghettos of Wilton Manors and the Castro for example), ethnic‐like enclaves, friendship groups, institutions, social venues, fictive kin‐like relations, value or even interest, imagined, symbolic, referential, or aspiration groups, and so forth. Clearly, in late modernity there is nothing like a “total” community of gay men. There have been and in some cases today are gay men's communities of mollies, S&amp;M, leather, drag, clones, house ball scenes (or communities), political and voluntary groups, party, sport and recreational, sexual scenes and networks, “bears,” social scenes (both commercial and noncommercial), gendered, raced, medicalized, capitalized, activist, resistant, marketed to, subaltern, secretive, professional associations (and professional groups permeated by same‐sex sexually interested and active men), Radical Faeries, queers, Act Up‐ers, Internet‐ and electronic‐based networks, groups, venues or communities, and so on. There clearly are, however, subgroups or social networks of gay men. Social movements’ analysis has some utility herese (Adam 1987). Field theory also appears to have the potential to assist with our understanding of the aggregated lives of gay men; that is, if we are interested in the birth, ebb, flow, impacts, outcomes, and possible death(s) of these gay communities, social networks or fields of culture, structure and action.",

      "title": "Virginity, Marriage and Rape in the Hebrew Bible",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 2, the high valuation of virginity and the proscription of sexual activity outside of, or prior to, marriage is one of the dominant features of societies wherein marriage by capture occurs. Furthermore, virginity is often contextualised, at an emic level, within a complex ideological framework which links it to ideas such as purity, spirituality and the assurance of unambiguous fatherhood. However, from an etic perspective, virginity may be located within the honour/shame system through being linked to ideas such as male honour and female sexual modesty. As a consequence, the loss of virginity outside of marriage leads to social stigmatisation and shame not only for the woman in question but also for her entire family, as well as a loss of marriageable status or heavily reduced bride-wealth. Ironically, marriage systems wherein virginity is expected prior to marriage and where a bride-price is expected for virgin wives, enable marriage by capture to occur since once virginity is taken (or even implied to have been taken) marriageable status and bride-price are also lost. These features of such marriage systems are also given an extra layer of complexity through the prevalence of the expectations for marriages to be endogamous. This chapter explores various texts where such issues occur to establish some of the expectations which may have existed for readers of Judges 21.",

Sexually, pelvic floor exercises can also be used to help men who have erectile dysfunction. A small pilot study involving ten men found that pelvic floor exercises in Indian men, along with lifestyle changes, led to a decrease in erectile dysfunction and an increase in sexual quality of life.

Como norma general el inicio de la actividad sexual coincide con la adolescencia y los adolescentes no suelen tener conciencia del peligro de las enfermedades de transmisión sexual, sin embargo, son más conocedores de los métodos anticonceptivos, pero dejan de lado las ETS. Una buena educación sexual desarrolla tanto la salud del individuo como la construcción de un modelo de comportamiento integral que engloba el equilibrio personal, las habilidades comunicativas y un buen desarrollo de la afectividad1. “Las infecciones de transmisión sexual se transmiten fundamentalmente a través de las relaciones sexuales desprotegidas sin uso del condón o preservativo, con penetración de la vía vaginal, anal u oral, y representan mundialmente un serio problema, tanto en términos de salud como económicos y sociales”2. Para realizar una intervención eficaz para prevenir dichas enfermedades, se precisa de equipos multidisciplinares de profesionales relacionados con la salud, éstos deben prestar una atención de calidad al paciente, de una manera uniforme y eficaz, promoviendo una serie de hábitos de vida saludables y un mejor conocimiento para evitar las transmisiones de ETS.

Here biomedical and psychosocial ways of thinking have to be combined with a view toward the couple. The possible effects of assisted reproduction on the sexual and partnership experience of the couple must be taken into account. Accordingly, key dimensions of sexuality (attachment, reproduction, and desire) and their relationship to each other, are also discussed. This includes the motives for wanting to have children as well as an understanding of sexuality not only as a means of procreation, but also as a form of body language communication that expresses the quality of the relationship (fulfillment or frustration of basic needs). Not only the potential parents but also the desired child/children depend on this—in sum—mutual \"love.\" In the context, reproduction as a site for conflict processing (especially for women) is also discussed. Finally, possibilities and limits of couple-related interventions are presented on the basis of an expanded concept of sexuality.",

      "abstract": "The quotes are proved by unjust and inhumane action of killing in the name of false pride. Honour killings or crime against humanity has risen to prominence in recent years and is a global phenomenon. The punishments for cases obviously vary from society to society as per the nature and extent of the defiance and dishonour. Honour killing is the result of  socio-psychological milieu of cynical societies where some acts of the behavior of human beings especially of the females are recognized as making dishonour to their families and communities and the lost honour is recovered by killings them. Honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perception of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The pseudo dishonour is generally the result of the unaccepted behaviors or the suspicion of such behaviors like desiring to terminate or prevent an arranged marriage or inter-caste marriage, inter-religion marriage, ‘sagotra’ marriage, desiring to marry by own choice or against the wishes of their family especially if to the member of a society deemed inappropriate, engaging in hetero-sexual acts outside marriage, adultery and engaging in homosexual acts etc. It is the menacing phenomena of repressive social practices in the name of honor triggering violent reaction from the influential members of community who are blind to individual autonomy. The ‘honour killings’ or ‘honour crimes’ are not peculiar to our country. It is an evil which haunts many other societies also and a global problem. Honour killings, for whatever reason needs immediate attention. Law needs to be used as a weapon to curb social evil. What is needed is a firm decision by the government for a separate law. There is paucity of research studies in this area. The networking of the police, judiciary, government, NGOs, human rights activists, sociologists, social workers, and psychologists is to be done in order to mitigate this social evil. Honour killing cannot be accepted in the name of culture or tradition. Honour killing is unjust and inhumane action. It is crime against mankind. The paper analyses the menace of honour killing, causes and legal framework.",

      "title": "Disability equality: Confronting the oppression of the past",
      "abstract": "At least 10 per cent of the world's people have a significant, long-term, physical or mental impairment which can and usually does disable them from taking part in the usual educational, social and economic activity in their community. This is due to barriers in attitudes, in the built environment and in the way society is organized, which prevent us from participating on an equal level with others. The reason why most of these barriers exist is because societies have until very recently not recognized that the systematic way in which they discriminate against disabled people when backed by discriminatory laws and practices of the state, often amounts to oppression. Barnes (1991) gives a full account of the discrimination disabled people encounter in all areas of life. This oppression has developed from our history, from myths and beliefs that attribute characteristics to disabled people which are unrelated to the reality of disabled people's lives. Such collections of attitudes often determine how non-disabled people respond to the 'different' in their midst; how they form stereotypes of the disabled person as saint, sinner, super-hero, freak, fiend, victim, obsessive avenger, isolationist, the butt of jokes, just a burden, or someone to be pitied. The particular form of stereotyped thinking depends on the society's history, its explanation of how it has come to be and the resultant culture.",

      "title": "Something's Missing",
      "abstract": "Let's be frank: women got a bad hand in the poker game of sex assignment, biologically speaking. Beneath all those rousing female-empowerment slogans (I am Woman, hear me roar); and the table turning (Men are really the weaker sex!); and the power-suit bravado (publishing titan Judith Regan: have the biggest cock in the building[Newman 2005, 56]), there are certain anatomical facts to contend with. The degree to which these anatomical facts prop up the social inequities of gender is a long, entangled story, to say the least, and nowhere more entangled than within female psychology itself. To put it bluntly, women lack penises, and like it or not, you're assigned to a gender based on what's between your legs, and for some entirely mysterious reason, in every known culture, the fact of having or not having a penis predicts who gets the economic power, social privilege, and political control. Yes, rather inexplicably (especially to those of us without one), the majority of the advantages in the world just seem to accrue to the class of humans possessing this appendage. Just some zany coincidence? Vexing and absurd though all this may be, thus far in the course of human history it's a social fact (a few long-ago putative matriarchies aside), though, things have been improving (incrementally) on the gender-equity front lately, at least in certain regions of the globe. Though not entirely. And how does the female psyche contend with this cheery news? Well, there's feminism, social protest, the activism route: the female condition is just historically wrong. Then there's femininity, by which I mean that one can endeavor to acquire one of these crucial appendages on a time-share basis-also known as heterosexuality, pair bonding, or in its legally contractual form, marriage: the system by which a few of those social and economic penis-privileges are supposed to trickle down to women and their offspring. To those pursuing this option: strive to be eye-catching and tractable, try to keep the desperation concealed. Also keep in mind the downside of these time-share penises: they invariably come with actual men attached to them-often large, messy, demanding ones-which produces for many women (especially those with more refined sensibilities) no end of annoyance, that is, once you finally manage to corral one of these specimens and set up housekeeping. Hence the popularity of male behavior modification, a favorite female pastime of our day, though rather less popular with its subjects. Studies have shown that with years of dedicated daily instruction and a structured system of punishments and rewards, a majority of men can learn to put the toilet seat down or conform to the other domestic requirements that-according to current popular wisdom about relations between the sexes-provide the basis for much male-female fractiousness, so don't give up yet. It's sometimes been suggested that lacking the body part that confers social advantage puts the female sex, on the whole, in a slightly resentful position, which may occasionally express itself in a degree of overmanagement when it comes to such domestic interactions. This is, needless to say, a scurrilous stereotype, though who wouldn't be resentful about being handed the anatomical short straw, so to speak, at least until the happy day when having the shorter straw finally stops mattering, a day that has not quite arrived, despite all the wonderful social progress and everything. But as long as anatomy is still enlisted as the emblem of differences between the sexes, and as long as those differences are mapped onto the female psyche, with something's missing as the psychological substrata of so many aspects of everyday life, from body image, to relationships, to work-well, apparently small things will continue to matter a lot. Is anatomy destiny? Over the course of human history, cultures have endlessly vacillated when it comes to describing the differences between the sexes. …",

Many adolescent girls are insufficiently informed about the mechanisms of reproduction or the techniques of birth control and first come to medical attention or consult a family planning center when already pregnant. However, among those teenagers who do become pregnant or even experience motherhood at an age when society would rather see them on school benches, some are neither ignorant about sexuality nor the victims of an unpredictable failure. For those, contraception and the desire for pregnancy or motherhood are in conflict with one another and is only further aggravated by various sociocultural and psychosocial factors. All too often, such a conflict results in a voluntarily ignored or unconsciously rejected contraception option, with an unplanned pregnancy as the outcome.",

Although direct and brief behavioral approaches to psychogenic sexual dysfunction began to appear in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Masters and Johnson's work influenced psychotherapeutic approaches to this problem in a manner unprecedented for other psychological disorders. Anxiety is considered to play a role in the development and maintenance of sexual dysfunctions for both men and women by writers of virtually every theoretical persuasion. Unlike sexually functional subjects and organogenically impotent men, psychogenically sexually dysfunctional men consistently underreport sexual arousal. There is a wide agreement among clinicians that several types of cognitive activities have a marked effect on sexual arousal and therefore may play an important role in the genesis and/or maintenance of sexual dysfunction. It is possible that these cognitive activities operate through the mechanism of cognitive interference, or distraction.",

      "abstract": "Paraphilias are defined as sexual attractions to objects or individuals not normally found attractive. This sexual 'deviance' has been shown to be normal, in such cases as masturbation or oral sex, even where legally proscribed, or it can be subcultural or individual. In the latter case it is likely to be affected by both biological and sociocultural factors. It is argued that, in some types of individual deviance, cultural factors are more likely to play an important role. Some cultures are seen as sex-positive and others as sex-negative but, within each cultural setting, attitudes towards sex and the function of sexual activity are a key to understanding the development of sexual deviance. In cultures where sex is seen as an attraction-led phenomenon rather than a purely procreative one, individuals are more likely to be attracted to 'objects'. This is likely to be influenced by the socio-centrism or the egocentrism of the society. The implications of these differences are discussed in relation to assessment and management.",

      "abstract": "I propose a theory that puts the notion of two sexual attractions into a precise, testable form, and then I mesh it with the periodic table model of the gender transpositions described previously (Pillard & Weinrich, 1987). I define a limerent sexual attraction, active in eroticizing the physical and personality characteristics of a particular Limerent Object, and a lusty sexual attraction, active in producing erotic arousal when encountering a new Lusty Object. Three hypotheses then account for much of what we know about sexual orientation: (a) Limerence and lustiness are experienced by both men and women—but there is an average difference in the ease with which each can be elicited in a particular sex. Limerence is experienced by most women in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas lustiness, when it occurs, is experienced mostly as a reaction to particular stimuli. Lustiness is experienced by most men in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas limerence, when it occurs, is experienced mostly in reaction to particular stimuli. (b) In some people the limerent attraction can be indifferent (or nearly so) to the sex or gender of the Limerent Object. (c) The lusty attraction is rarely indifferent to the sex or gender of the Lusty Object. Individuals may vary in their readiness to respond to the two kinds of attraction. Some of this variability can be understood in the light of the periodic table model described previously, and some of it can be understood in the light of cultural conditioning and socialization. The result is a theory that deduces many of the major facts about sexual orientation from only a small number of hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "Disfuncao sexual refere-se a dificuldade sentida por uma pessoa ou casal durante qualquer estagio da  atividade sexual , incluindo  desejo ,  excitacao  ou orgasmo . As disfuncoes sexuais femininas podem afetar o desejo sexual e alterar as respostas psicologicas e fisiologicas do corpo frente aos estimulos sexuais, causando sofrimento e insatisfacao nao so na pessoa, como tambem no seu par. Tem como etiologia causas orgânicas, hematologicas, problemas psicologicos e geneticos. Pode ser primaria, com ocorrencia na primeira experiencia sexual ou secundaria, quando ocorre apos previa competencia. O presente estudo tem o objetivo de identificar as principais causas de disfuncoes sexuais na mulher, ampliar os conhecimentos sobre a disfuncao sexual na populacao feminina devido a mesma estar sujeita a fatores que venham interferir no relacionamento, trazendo sofrimento e dificuldade na atividade sexual e que possam vir a afetar diretamente sua vida interpessoal e qualidade de vida, e analisar o papel da assistencia de enfermagem relacionado a disfuncao sexual. Realizou-se um levantamento bibliografico sendo analisados artigos cientificos, periodicos, CAPES, BDENF, e obras literarias no periodo de agosto a novembro de 2013 filtrados pelos indicadores booleanos: saude da mulher e disfuncao sexual ou enfermagem. Verificou-se que os disturbios sexuais sao usualmente diagnosticados quando e parte importante das alteracoes da sexualidade de um individuo. Podem existir por toda a vida, serem adquiridos devido a experiencias de vida ou a patologias clinicas e/ou psiquiatricas. Dificuldades de relacionamento podem levar ao aparecimento de patologias da sexualidade humana e vice-versa. Essas dificuldades podem ou nao desencadear ansiedade na pessoa afetada, dependendo do quadro clinico e da visao que a pessoa possui sobre a importância de sexo em sua vida.. E comum que estas alteracoes sejam escondidas com muito conflito pela pessoa acometida, ocasionando solidao, ansiedade e sintomas de depressao. E importante reconhecer as causas emocionais e psicologicas da disfuncao sexual feminina. E tambem ser causada por condicoes medicas escondidas, doencas, medicacao, fadiga, idade, menopausa e outras causas fisicas. A assistencia de enfermagem e essencial para tratar a mulher com disfuncao sexual, fundamentada de conhecimentos sobre sexualidade tera competencia para realizar educacao sexual nas diferentes etapas do ciclo da vida, em condicoes normais ou patologicas. Conclui-se que para a fundamentacao da assistencia de enfermagem e necessario que o enfermeiro adote uma visao holistica que abrange uma ideia de conjunto, considerando os aspectos psicologicos, sociais, culturais e espirituais, durante todo o cuidar prestado.

The main objective of the present paper is to examine these new addictions thoroughly, by highlighting the characteristics of these new compulsive pathologies and the main and distinctive features of the most widespread, that is to say sexual addiction, cybersex addiction, affective addiction, shopping addiction (compulsive shopping) and game of chance addiction (pathological game of chance addiction). It has been often highlighted that these new addiction cause healthy, psychological and social life disorders, such as the loss of self control, compulsiveness and inclination in repeating the action, alteration of consciousness and lack of sense of the reality. It is therefore necessary to improve our knowledge of this new phenomenon and encourage the development of effective interventions.

      "abstract": "INTISARI : Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui penyebab seseorang menjadi biseksual; dan ini terjadi pada orang dewasa yang sudah mempunyai pasangan. Penelitian ini adalah studi kasus dengan pendekatan kualitatif. Penulis juga berhasil mewawancarai 13 Responden atau Informan, orang-orang biseksual, yang berusia antara 30-65 tahun di kota-kota besar di Indonesia. Dengan mengunakan pendekatan fenomenologi dan penjelasan yang deskriptif, hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa fenomena biseksual disebabkan oleh pola asuh orag tua terhadap anaknya; adanya pengalaman masa lalu yang buruk terjadi, seperti pelecehan seksual ataupun korban sodomi; pengaruh lingkungan yang juga membentuk mereka menjadi biseksual; serta ingin mendapatkan kepuasan yang lebih kepada fantasi seksual mereka yang tidak didapatkan pada pasangan resmi mereka. Penelitian ini juga mendapati bahwa media sosial ikut menyumbang dalam mengeksplore keinginan yang dipendam dari mereka yang menjadi biseksual; serta panti pijat ataupun sauna menjadi tempat proses perkenalan sampai dengan melakukan hubungan seksual sesama jenis. Dalam status berhubungan diantara kaum biseksual terdapat dua tipe, yakni kaum biseksual yang memiliki komitmen untuk tetap setia pada pasangan sejenisnya yang satu saja; dan kaum biseksual yang tidak memiliki komitmen, dalam artian hanya untuk bersenang-senang saja dan kerap kali gonta-ganti dalam berhubungan dengan pasangan sejenis. Problema kaum biseksual ini harus difahami secara mendalam, dikaji sebab-sebab dan faktor yang mempengaruhinya, serta dicari cara mengatasi dan jalan keluarnya yang bijak oleh para pengambil kebijakan dalam bidang pendidikan, agama, sosial, kesehatan, dan bahkan politik negara.

This study aims to determine the cause of a person being bisexual; and this happens to adults who already have a partner. This research is a case study with a qualitative approach. The Author also successfully interviewed 13 Respondents or Informants, bisexual people, aged between 30-65 years in big cities in Indonesia. By using phenomenological approach and descriptive explanation, the results of the study indicate that the bisexual phenomenon is caused by the parents' upbringing for their children; bad past experiences, such as sexual harassment or victims of sodomy; environmental influences that also shape them to be bisexual; and want to get more satisfaction with their sexual fantasies that are not found in their official partners. The study also found that social media contributed to exploring the buried desires of those who became bisexual; and a massage or sauna as a place for introductions to same-sex sexual relations. In the status of relationships between bisexuals there are two types, namely bisexuals who have a commitment to remain loyal to one partner of the same type; and bisexuals who have no commitment, in the sense of just having fun and often mutually in dealing with same-sex couples. The problem of bisexuals must be understood in depth, examined the causes and factors that influence it, and sought ways to overcome and wise solutions by policy makers in the fields of education, religion, social, health, and even state politics.

      "abstract": "Perilaku penyimpangan seksual yang muncul di kalangan masyarakat adalah salah satu dari sekian banyak masalah seksual yang sedang marak saat ini yang dikenal dengan istilah Lesbian, Gay, Biseksual, dan Transgender (LGBT). Konsekuensi logis dari perilaku penyimpangan seksual adalah munculnya berbagai penyakit kelamin (Veneral Diseases/VD), atau penyakit akibat hubungan seksual (Sexually Transmitted Diseases/STD). Dampak negatif fenomena LGBT tidak hanya ditinjau dari sisi kesehatan namun juga mengikis dan menggugat keharmonisan hidup bermasyarakat. Dari sudut agama dan sosiologi, LGBT akan menyebabkan peningkatan gejala penyimpangan sosial dan kemaksiatan hingga tidak dapat dikendalikan. Dilihat dari sisi psikologi, dapat mempengaruhi kejiwaan dan memberi efek yang sangat kuat pada syaraf. Pelaku LGBT setiap tahun cenderung meningkat bukan hanya di kota besar saja tetapi juga merambah ke pelosok desa dengan kejadian fenomena gunung es termasuk di Kota Pekanbaru. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui Faktor Predisposisi, Faktor Pemungkin dan Faktor Pendorong perubahan perilaku penyimpangan seksual oleh LGBT di Kota Pekanbaru. Jenis penelitian ini merupakan penelitian Kualitatif dengan wawancara mendalam dan observasi terbatas. Informan pada penelitian ini adalah mereka yang memiliki perilaku penyimpangan seksual LGBT yang berdomisili di pekanbaru yang dapat diajak berkomunikasi sesuai dengan tujuan penelitian dan sebagai informan kunci adalah teman dekat dari informan utama. Analisa data yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Analisis Kualitatif Isi (content analisys). Hasil dalam penelitian ini adalah mengungkapkan bahwa masih kurangnya pengetahuan mereka terutama tentang dampak dari perilaku menyimpangan seksual oleh LGBT; Mereka menginginkan keberadaan mereka dihargai; Motivasi mereka menjadi LGBT adalah mencari sensasi kasih sayang yang belum pernah mereka dapatkan sebelumnya; Mereka beranggapan bahwa inilah jalan hidup mereka yang telah diatur oleh Tuhan Yang Maha Esa dan tidak berdosa jika perilaku LGBT ini terus dijalani karena mereka beranggapan bahwa perilaku ini tidak akan bisa berubah menjadi normal; Media massa, Tempat hiburan malam, Peran orang tua, peran teman sebaya dan lingkungan serta peran guru dalam mendidik siswa sangat berpengaruh terhadap perubahan perilaku mereka. Dengan demikian diharapkan kerjasama berbagai pihak untuk meningkatkan pengetahuan, pemahaman, kesadaran, dan ketakwaan mereka kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa sehingga akhirnya mereka dapat hidup normal meninggalkan perilaku penyimpangan seksual yang selama ini mereka lakukan.

The critical analysis of heteronormativity aims to explain by what means heterosexuality achieves an allegedly superior status with regard to non‐heterosexual sexualities. Heterosexuality refers to sexual attraction and sexual behaviors between men and women. Historically, the term emerged in the nineteenth century to designate an erotic orientation towards “the other” sex which was supposed to be different from other “sexual orientations,” such as homosexuality (orientation toward the same sex) or bisexuality (orientation toward two sexes). Heteronormativity works through binary codes (male/female; heterosexual/homosexual) and reinforces practices of oppression across multiple social terrains.",

Here, we investigate how the co-occurrence of critical events and, in particular, the spacing in time of events across the life course influences life satisfaction in later life. We argue that life phases densely populated of critical events may translate into an acute resource drain affecting wellbeing in long term more strongly than if the same events were sparsely distributed. We use retrospective biographical information on critical events in family, work, health and residential trajectories in Switzerland to construct a life course Concentration Index of events based on the number, the time-lag between the occurrences and the number of life domains involved. Our results show that the higher is the concentration in time of critical events, the stronger will be their negative long-term effect on wellbeing, net of socio-demographic characteristics, of the total number of events ever experienced and of the time since the last event. Furthermore, such negative effect is even stronger if the person experienced periods dense of events during midlife and older adulthood than during youth or early adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Developmental stuttering is a common disorder of speech dissiliency that is characterized by excessive repetitions of sounds, syllables, and monosyllabic words, as well as sound prolongations and complete blockages of the vocal tract. About 60 million people are affected and it is more common between the age of 3 and 6, when children begin forming sentences and connecting thoughts verbally. There are three types of stuttering known as developmental stuttering, neurogenic stuttering, and psychogenic stuttering. The exact pathophysiology of developmental stuttering is unknown; however, various family and twin studies have repeatedly implicated heredity as a major factor in the etiology of stuttering. It is clear that the genetic influence is not in the form of an exact single gene effect such as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or x-linked in all families; however, in all of the inheritance forms it is influenced by sex with higher occurrence in males than females at a ratio of 4:1 in older children and adults. Recently special genetic locus has been determined on several autosomal chromosomes related to developmental stuttering. In this report, the proband is a 20-year-old boy was referred to our clinic for premarriage genetic counseling; he has been affected since 3 years and now is under cure. three generation study of his family show 13 individuals are affected by stuttering. For the first it occurred in the proband's grandfather and after this time about all of affected cases has been seen in consanguineous marriages. Therefore, the genetical inheritance of stuttering is crystal clear in this family and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is proposed. Totally in such families with repeated occur of stuttering, we cannot account it as a multifactorial disorder.",

The majority of cases recorded are of a pseudo type, in which the formation of the external genitalia is such as to give rise to the impression that both male and female organs are present, but in which, at operation or necropsy the glands of one sex are observed. The other sexual parts are mixed or are",

      "abstract": "The impact of hormonal contraception on mental and sexual health has long been either ignored or considered to be much less important than the cardiovascular, metabolic and cancer risks. In recent years the interest in these side effects, having an impact on the quality of life of users, has grown due to several reasons. In the last decades different scientific approaches to gain empirical evidence about the type and extent of negative effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood and sex did not result in clear evidence-based statements due to the complexity of the interaction between contraceptive methods and mental and sexual health (inconsistent measurement of patient reported outcomes, multiplicity of intervening variables etc). Based on an understanding of the biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to the mental and sexual health of the individual user, and the individual impact of hormonal contraception, which can have negative, positive or neutral effects on mood and sexuality, an individualized approach is proposed to integrate mental and sexual health into the practice of contraceptive counselling and care.",

      "abstract": "The social, political and cultural developments which brought during the last few decades to a change in the relationships between gender find an important correlate in linguistic usage, which on the one hand reflects changes and on the other sustains and strengthens it. Such new usages affect in particular, in many European languages, the correct use of the feminine gender when defining a woman’s profession or social role. Italian seems to be late in accepting the change (Avvocata? Avvocatessa? Donna avvocato? Avvocato donna?), whereas French, German and Spanish don’t hesitate in using the feminine (avocate/Anwaltin/abogada). English, on the other hand, where no such gender distinction holds for the vast majority of nouns, is moving in the opposite direction, abolishing the few cases formerly existing (no longer actor vs. actress but actor or performer for all). One specially sensitive and interesting case are the pronouns: if all languages use the pronoun corresponding to the person’s gender, what happens when we don’t know the gender of a particular person? Some languages have been developing new forms of genderless pronoun in order to avoid repetitions: in English each student must bring his/her own book has been replaced by each student must bring their book; in Swedish han/hon (he/she) gave way to hen for everyone. Such genderless forms, by the way, are also used by non binary and gender fluid people in order to avoid the choice between masculine and feminine. Finally, the attempt not to repeat masculine and feminine forms in addressing groups (it. Cari colleghi e care colleghe, and so on) led to the research for new graphic solutions, such as, in Italian, the asterisk (car* collegh*) or, more recently the IPA symbol for schwa (car« collegh«).",

Instead, they are manifestations of an individual's particular way of relating to their lived experience, for which they are responsible and in respect of which they possess free will. The philosophical basis for the existential understanding of addiction is supported by neuroscience. Working with a sex addict existentially involves the phenomenological clarification of their experience and facilitates them in the identification and ownership of their freedom.",

      "abstract": "Once a body is named or interpellated as either ‘boy’ or ‘girl’, they will be expected to convey, communicate, relate and/or display a social gender that co-ordinates with the labelled sex. This is part of the process known as cis-gendering. 1 I propose that emotions are also socialized during this process and are expected to be communicated and displayed to co-ordinate with the named social gender. This ensures that bodies remain uncontestably cis-gendered and heterosexual. The interpellation of emotion for feeling is thus a major part of the socialization process used to construct cis-gendered bodies. In comparison, those people who feel uncomfortable doing their named social gender because it is at odds with their labelled sex may claim a trans 2 gender identity. This incorporates a wide range of self-identities including a gender-queer or non-binary 3 identity (neutrois.me; transmediawatch.org). This article aims to explore how feelings are experienced in relation to a trans-gendered identity and what these mean for understanding and doing gender as ‘non-binary’. Using quotes from genderqueerconfession.com written by those who identify as members of a non-binary gendered community, I present a contemporary analysis of how gender is being re-interpreted and performed so that people may experience feelings they describe as either, both or neither ‘male’ or ‘female’. Findings show how gender becomes dis-orientated and takes up a liminal space where bodies and emotions are re-negotiated according to an emerging paradigm of trans-emotionality. 4 No longer confined to a restrictive binary system, I argue that gender is an affectively embodied process that is constantly imagined, embodied, re-imagined and re-embodied.",

One common mode of adaptation is reminiscence, which serves a variety of functions—some healthy, others not. Most of the cognitive changes of late life are a result of diminished processing speed. Learning is more vulnerable to distraction, verbal memory is reduced, and strategies for putting facts into long-term memory become less efficient. Crystallized intelligence, the store of accumulated knowledge and experience, continues to increase throughout life. Fluid intelligence, the ability to manipulate the crystallized store, diminishes through adulthood. Most sensory systems exhibit higher thresholds and less specificity with increasing age. Physiological changes affect sexual anatomy and physiology, but sexual desire and enjoyment are typically maintained in the absence of disease.",

The authors aim to review the current literature for areas of success as well as areas of improvement in order to better the sexual health of the transgender community. Recent Findings Gender dysphoria is a feeling of distress experienced by those whose gender assigned at birth is not in line with their gender identity. While social transition to the desired gender can suffice for some, medical and surgical interventions are often sought out to achieve gender euphoria, the decrease or absence of gender dysphoria. Often, issues with sexual function and satisfaction can trigger gender dysphoria, especially prior to social, medical, or surgical transition. Summary Surgical genital gender affirmation has been the most studied in terms of sexual function and improvement of gender dysphoria. Surgical complications, hormonal changes, and other organic causes of sexual dysfunction can still interfere with one’s overall sexual satisfaction. A validated measure of sexual function for trans men and trans women is needed to better assess outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Purpose – Homeless populations are a politically contentious problem and researchers struggle to achieve a balanced approach. They place emphasis on sharply contrasting factors, such as; institutional structures, ideologies or individual dispositions and differences. Central questions remain unanswered, i.e., is homelessness an outcome of society’s failings related to housing shortages, or a personal choice, as in the status of “intentional homelessness?” The purpose of this paper is to set aside assumptions, to explore experiences of homelessness and psychosis. Design/methodology/approach – An existentially informed hermeneutic phenomenological analysis; exploring transcribed narratives from semi-structured interviews with three men. Findings – These participants started to wander as a spontaneous response to distressing life experiences. Without any plan they travelled to new locations living on the street. Being contained and treated against their will in the psychiatric system was another source of distress. They did not choose homelessness through a rational calculation of their best interests. They felt at odds with society, which did not protect them and failed to meet their needs. Research limitations/implications – In qualitative research, findings are not generalisable to other settings. Practical implications – Homeless services should be enhanced by psychological expertise along with more person-centred emphatic approaches; the authors of social policies should consider their philosophical assumptions. Social implications – Systemised mental healthcare does not solve complex problems; fails to meet needs. Originality/value – The analysis informs the design of further research, prompts practitioners to review their understandings and provides grounds for the rewriting of policies.",

      "title": "La competencia emocional como recurso inhibidor para la perpetración del maltrato psicológico en la pareja",
      "abstract": "La violencia contra la pareja constituye, actualmente, la forma mas alarmante de violencia interpersonal. Sin embargo, a pesar de la magnitud del fenomeno, existe una tendencia general a restringir el foco de interes a la dimension fisica del mismo. De esta forma el estudio del maltrato psicologico es relegado a un segundo plano, ignorando aquellos trabajos que evidencian la presencia de agresiones psicologicas con secuelas de gravedad equiparada o superior a las de naturaleza fisica, aunque las primeras presenten una mayor dificultad en su deteccion.Diferentes investigaciones establecen una vinculacion entre una amplia gama de sintomas psicologicos y comportamentales consecuentes a la violencia psicologica en la pareja, con varias de las dimensiones de la inteligencia emocional. De esta forma, las parejas con elevadas tasas de conflictividad responsables de la instauracion de la dinamica relacional violenta, parecen responder en el plano interpersonal con registros comunicativos alejados de la inteligencia emocional o de competencias como la empatia, el autocontrol y la cooperacion hacia sus parejas. En la presente investigacion se analiza el maltrato psicologico en las relaciones de pareja (desvalorizacion, hostilidad, indiferencia, intimidacion, imposicion de conductas, culpabilizacion y bondad aparente) y su relacion con el nivel de competencias emocionales (emotividad, eficacia, rigidez e ilusion) que presentan los miembros que conforman la misma. Se desarrollo en el contexto de la Universidad de Extremadura (Espana). La seleccion de la muestra fue aleatoria y se compuso de 1 080 estudiantes universitarios/as. De ellos, 332 varones y 748 mujeres de edades comprendidas en cuatro categorias que abarcan el intervalo de 17 a 23 anos o mas. Una vez seleccionada la muestra establecimos un calendario para la aplicacion de los instrumentos, conjuntamente con los decanos, directores de centros universitarios y secretarias academicas. La aplicacion de los instrumentos se realizo de forma colectiva en una sesion en horario de manana y tarde, durante los cursos academicos 2007/2008 y 2008/2009. Los resultados del estudio confirman la presencia de patrones de violencia psicologica en las relaciones de pareja de los estudiantes universitarios/as. Destacan como subfactores de maltrato psicologico ejercidos con mayor frecuencia en estos jovenes los situados en el factor Indiferencia, en oposicion a aquellos menos habituales comprendidos en el factor Bondad aparente. En cuanto a la relacion entre las conductas psicologicamente abusivas y las competencias emocionales durante el noviazgo, se evidencian diferencias significativas. Finalmente se confirma la presencia de correlaciones significativas en la mayor parte de los factores y subfactores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja y las diferentes competencias emocionales. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren en terminos generales que los indicadores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja comienzan a manifestarse durante las relaciones de noviazgo, concretamente: trivializaciones, reproches, no empatia ni apoyo, juzgar, criticar, corregir, insistencia abusiva, acusaciones, etc. Se aprecia como la manifestacion mas habitual la falta de implicacion afectiva que imposibilita la empatia, el apoyo y el respeto hacia la individualidad de la victima, promoviendo conductas de monopolio por parte del agresor en la pareja. Asimismo se confirma la existencia de una mayor tendencia al empleo de las diferentes manifestaciones de violencia psicologica por parte de aquellos estudiantes universitarios/as con recursos emocionales mas precarios. Datos que adquieren una mayor consistencia conforme revisamos los multiples estudios que actuan como soporte empirico. En este sentido, el mayor reto es la promocion del analisis cientifico de la violencia psicologica en las relaciones de noviazgo, asi como su orientacion al diseno de programas de prevencion primaria centrados en el desarrollo de la educacion emocional como elemento central para el establecimiento de relaciones de parejas plenas y saludables.",

      "title": "Expanding the Scope of a Dynamic Perspective on Positive Adolescent Sexual Development",
      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting on sexual health in 2002 to clarify definitions of healthy sexual development and concluded with a powerful statement testifying to the central and multifaceted role of sexuality in human health and well-being [World Health Organization, 2004]. According to their model, sexuality incorporates eroticism, intimacy, pleasure, reproduction, and one's own gender identity, and it is manifested in sexual behaviors, wishes, desires, fantasies, attitudes, roles, and relationships. The WHO also views sexuality as inherently multidimensional, integrating biological, cultural, social, economic, psychological, ethical, and spiritual factors. Positive or healthy sexuality, then, requires that individuals have adequate freedom and knowledge to pursue safe and satisfying sexuality. In the compelling words of the WHO [2004]:Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. (p. 3)A decade after the publication of this powerful statement, the study of adolescent sexuality remains more focused on negative than positive experiences. Although a number of scholars have advocated for positively-oriented conceptualizations of adolescent sexuality [Russell, 2005; Tolman & McClelland, 2011], the majority of developmental research continues to view adolescent sexuality through a lens of danger and threat, overemphasizing the timing and frequency of risky sexual acts and their negative implications for future health and adjustment. We remain woefully uninformed about youths' total psychological and physical experience of erotic and affectional desires, cognitions, and behaviors from childhood to adulthood and their potentially positive developmental implications for notions of self, identity, and relationships.For these reasons, Miriam Arbeit's [this issue] skill-based model for promoting adolescent sexual development is a welcome addition to contemporary theorizing about adolescent sexuality. It draws productively from existing strains of research on positive adolescent sexual development [Bay-Cheng, 2012; Fine & McClelland, 2006; Impett, Muise, & Breines, 2013; Lamb, 2010; Russell, 2005; Tolman, 2012; Tolman & McClelland, 2011] but breaks new ground in its more specific and process-oriented approach. Whereas previous scholars have effectively outlined the need for and the promise of positive developmental models of adolescent sexuality, Arbeit has taken on the thorny details, outlining a vision of the fundamental components of positive adolescent sexuality (sexual selfhood, sexual negotiation, and sexual empowerment) and the psychosocial skills that they require. A particular strength of the model is the proactive role that it grants to adolescents themselves as drivers of their own development. In contrast to the hundreds of studies that focus on how adolescent sexuality is shaped by outside forces (such as parents, peers, teachers, school, their church, the media, the Internet, and the culture at large), Arbeit's model casts adolescents themselves as the central characters in their own emerging sexual selfhood. In her conceptualization, youths are not simply passive actors, consuming conflicting messages from parents, peers and the media, and moving back and forth with changing cultural tides, but active shapers of their own sexual-developmental trajectories. This allows researchers to ask far more sophisticated questions about the dynamic interchanges between youths and their environments that produce variability in sexual-developmental pathways and outcomes.I am enthusiastic about Arbeit's model and its potential to generate important new questions and answers about adolescent sexual development. Nonetheless, there are \"soft spots\" in the model that could benefit from greater attention, clarification, and expansion. My discussion of these areas below is intended to enhance and improve the impact and generativity of Arbeit's model rather than to challenge it. She has charted a new course in the study of adolescent sexuality, and working to test and refine this new course should be the work of all scholars of adolescent sexuality.Arbeit grounds her model in relational developmental systems theory [Lerner, Lerner, Almerigi, & Theokas, 2006; Overton, 2013], which views human development as the evolving product of an ongoing series of dynamic person-context relations. Yet this perspective raises an inevitable question: why restrict a model of sexual development to adolescence? Although the developmental transitions of adolescence arguably make it a \"critical period\" for sexual development, sexuality is obviously a lifelong experience. Furthermore, a growing body of theoretical models related to developmental systems theory have called for \"cascade\" models of human development [Lansford, Malone, Dodge, Pettit, & Bates, 2010; Masten & Cicchetti, 2010; Ryff, Singer, & Seltzer, 2002; Ryff, Singer, Wing, & Love, 2001], in which each developmental phenomenon is conceptualized as both the output of prior developmental processes and the input for forthcoming processes. Hence, from this perspective it may be impossible to study positive adolescent sexual development without beginning with a focus on childhood sexual experiences, cognitions, and skills. Arbeit is clearly aware of the relevance of childhood processes and indicates that sexual skill development begins with children's own bodily exploration and early childhood interactions, but these childhood experiences receive little explicit attention in her model, nor do the potential sexual-developmental implications of early childhood adversity, neglect, or abuse. More comprehensive integration of childhood sexual development into Arbeit's model would substantially expand its reach.Similarly, it would appear to be impossible to differentiate positive versus negative trajectories of sexual development during adolescence without extending the time frame forward substantially into middle and late adulthood. After all, research has shown that many adult sexual problems and dysfunctions are related to interpersonal and situational stressors occurring at all stages of the life course [Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999]. Hence, there is no particular age at which we can confidently establish that a youth has succeeded in developing a healthy, positive, sexual self. Rather, positive sexual development is a life span task which requires a life span research frame and an investigative approach capable of attending to the cumulative, cascading processes that give rise to dynamic changes in sexual selfhood across different ages and contexts.Arbeit's model is well-suited to take this approach: she indicates that the hypothesized developmental processes outlined in figure 1 are likely to recur many times over, resulting in the development and refinement of different sets of skills across an expanding range of contexts. Surely, these recurrences may occur over the entire life span, as developmental and contextual changes create new needs and challenges. Consider, for example, the skills required for effective sexual negotiation. As Arbeit indicates, the development of skills related to verbalizing one's needs and boundaries, establishing and negotiating consent, and successfully seeking and providing pleasure are critically important during the adolescent years, but they may require substantial refinement and elaboration at many different stages of the life span as individuals encounter new sexual partners with different expectations, different bodies, different patterns of communication, and different sexual tastes. Aging, too, creates new challenges: consider two individuals in their 70s dating for the first time, struggling to find an artful way to describe and work around potential physical and/or health limitations to their sexual behavior. No matter how successfully they might have mastered sexual negotiation in previous decades, the new developmental challenges accompanying later stages of life create new challenges and the need for new sets of skills. Similarly, imagine a married couple coping with the reestablishment of sexual intimacy after one partner's infidelity. The challenges of this novel context might tax their skills of sexual negotiation in new and unexpected ways.Hence, as long as individuals undergo lifelong psychosocial, biological, emotional, cognitive, and ideological changes, and as long as they move into and out of different relationships and contexts, they will inevitably repeat and revisit Arbeit's hypothesized processes of sexual development. Accordingly, one of the most generative implications of Arbeit's perspective is that it could be used as the foundation for a truly life span model of sexual development. Although adolescence might prove to be a particularly critical period for the development of sexual skills and sexual selfhood, it is clearly not the only one. Rather, adolescent sexuality represents one stage in a cascade model - sexual feelings, experiences, skills, and identities during the adolescent years are both the outcome of childhood feelings, experiences, skills, and identities, and also the drivers of feelings, experiences, skills, and identities during early, middle, and late adulthood. Although Arbeit does not substantively integrate this cascade perspective into her model, it is fully consistent with her emphasis on relational developmental systems theory.Another area of Arbeit's model which would profit from expansion and elaboration concerns the role of biological processes. Although Arbeit makes several references to the influence of biological factors on adolescent sexual development, these references are relatively vague, and the overall role of biological processes in her model is underdeveloped. If, as she states, her goal is to draw greater attention to the systematic relations involved in promoting positive sexual development, then biology deserves a larger and more specific role. Furthermore, greater focus on the biological body would enhance Arbeit's commendable emphasis on embodiment as a critical component of sexual development. As Arbeit reviews, the concept of embodiment encapsulates the fact that youths' sexual development, their sense of sexual selfhood, and their development as sexual citizens is negotiated by, with, and through their bodies following the influential work of Overton [2008] and Tolman, Bowman, and Fahs [2014]. Although research on embodiment typically focuses on the subjective phenomenology of bodily experience, it can and should include a focus on the many systems within the body which undergo change before, during, and after sexual maturation. Arbeit highlights that the development of sexuality-related skills occurs within young people's bodies and in relation to \"past and future bodies.\" During a time of such incredible physical change, these past and future bodies might be astoundingly different, both in obvious and not-so-obvious ways. Although an adolescent (and his or her peers, parents, and potential sexual partners) might be acutely aware of bodily changes signaling sexual maturation (height, hair growth, breast size, hip size, muscular development), they are probably less aware of invisible changes such as those related to brain structure and function and to autonomic and neuroendocrine functioning. Yet these changes undoubtedly interact in critical ways with adolescents' other social and sexual transitions, and their implications for youths' sense of embodied sexuality deserve greater attention. Hence, one provocative and potentially transformative direction for Arbeit's model would incorporate a more thoroughgoing conceptualization of \"the body,\" in all of its interrelated systems and processes, to provide a more biologically specific understanding of sexual development.Consider, for example, the role of hormonal factors. Arbeit makes general reference to the role of hormones in the development of sexual desire, but the complex relationship between hormones and sexual desire merits more detailed and specific attention within a contextual model such as Arbeit's. For example, in addition to the well-known changes in gonadal hormones that youths undergo during pubertal maturation, there are also substantive increases in adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androestione, which occur during the maturation of the adrenal gland between 6 and 10 years of age, and some scholars have argued that these hormonal changes may be responsible for the fact that many adults recollect their first erotic crushes and thoughts as occurring around the age of 10 [Herdt & McClintock, 2000]. Hence, understanding the different psychological sequelae of adrenal versus gonadal androgens is important for understanding youths' emerging and changing experiences of sexual arousal from childhood to adolescence.Similarly, van Anders [2012] has found that the hormonal underpinnings of dyadic desire (i.e., desire for sexual activity and release with another person) differ significantly from the hormonal underpinnings of solitary desire (i.e., desire for sexual release without a partner). Although most research fails to even acknowledge this distinction, van Anders' work has shown that, in adults, the distinction has important biobehavioral implications. Specifically, she found that women's testosterone levels were positively linked to their solitary desires and that masturbation frequency moderated this link. Yet testosterone levels were negatively correlated with women's dyadic desires. These provocative findings suggest that the developmental transition from desiring solitary sexual release to desiring partnered sexual release may have hormonal as well as social and cultural determinants and warrants longitudinal investigation before, during, and after pubertal maturation. For example, one possibility is that the very distinction between solitary and dyadic desire may only become meaningful after puberty due to the changing levels of gonadal hormones. Another possibility is that the subjective experiences of these two types of desire change substantially during the pubertal transition. These examples demonstrate the potential value of a more specific integration of biological processes into Arbeit's model.Neurobiological development is another growing area of research that deserves more substantive attention. There is now an extensive body of neurobiological research on sexuality (most commonly using functional magnetic resonance imaging, but also positron emission tomography, and, less often, electroencephalography), and much of this research bears on the question of overlap between the neurobiological bases for romantic love, emotional attachment, and sexual arousal [reviewed in Diamond & Dickenson, 2012]. Studies of adults suggest that romantic love and sexual arousal are neither neurobiologically independent nor redundant but show complex patterns of linkage that may be related to their experiential contexts. This raises provocative questions regarding developmental changes before and during the adolescent years, when youths' capacities for sexual desire and romantic attachment undergo notable changes. Might developmental changes in the brain structures involved in sexual desire and romantic attachment - and their interconnectedness - relate to developmental changes in youths' subjective experiences of sex and love and their motives for emotional and physical intimacy? Investigating such questions from a developmental-systems perspective (in which biological changes interact fundamentally with contextual factors) can make tremendous contributions to the basic developmental science of sexuality and can elucidate the degree to which other aspects of neural development (for example, maturation in structures related to decision-making, future-oriented thinking, self-regulation) interact with the brain regions involved in sexuality to shape youths' trajectories of sexual behavior and other behaviors.Finally, Arbeit's model would profit from greater integration with the \"differential susceptibility\" model of Belsky and Pluess [2009] and the related \"biological sensitivity to context\" model of Boyce and Ellis [2005]. According to these models, children and adolescents with heightened autonomic and neuroendocrine reactivity to stress are differentially sensitive to both the negative and positive features of their social-environmental contexts. This model has its roots in the well-known diathesis-stress model of development, which predicts that underlying vulnerability factors confer heightened risk for poor adjustment outcomes when combined with environmental challenges. Yet differential susceptibility models additionally predict that the same factors that predispose certain youths to heightened risk within suboptimal contexts also predispose youths to heightened benefits within enriched and nurturant contexts. Such models may prove particularly powerful for elucidating the factors driving diversity in youths' sexual-developmental trajectories. For example, differential susceptibility models would predict that autonomically reactive adolescents are disproportionately likely to develop adjustment problems after experiencing a sequence of negative and disempowering sexual experiences but that the very same youths are disproportionately likely to develop heightened self-esteem and an enhanced sense of sexual agency after experiencing a sequence of positive, pleasurable, and empowering sexual experiences.Most of the extant research testing differential susceptibility models focuses on young children, yet testing such models among adolescents is important because the neurobiological systems underlying stress regulation are still undergoing maturation during this period [Dahl & Spear, 2004], and the emotional and self-regulatory challenges and opportunities posed by adolescent sexual desire and behavior likely place heightened demands on these systems. Hence, greater assessment of individual differences in youths' physiological stress reactivity, in concert with detailed assessment of their early rearing environments and their current environmental contexts, has the potential to reveal long-range patterns of adaptation and adversity that help to explain how different youths may undergo similar sexual experiences in adolescence and yet show markedly different adjustment outcomes. In particular, research investigating positive and negative family and peer influences on adolescent sexuality would profit by using differential susceptibility models to investigate which youths are most susceptible to such influences and how this information can be integrated into attempts to develop health-promoting interventions.A strength of Arbeit's model is her multifaceted conceptualization of sexual selfhood, which involves awareness of one's desires, adherence to one's sense of sexual ethics, and the process of \"grappling\" with sexual identity development. I would argue that sexual selfhood also necessarily involves grappling with one's gender identity and that this aspect of sexual development requires further elaboration within Arbeit's model. Just as healthy sexual selfhood requires that youths wrestle with and interrogate their beliefs, cognitions, and phenomenology regarding sexual desire, it also requires wrestling with and interrogating their beliefs, cognitions, and phenomenology regarding femaleness and maleness.A growing body of research challenges the notion that gender identity finishes developing in early childhood and indicates that many youths actively question their subjective experience and presentation of gender during childhood and adolescent years [reviewed in Diamond, 2013a]. One large-scale study of 6- to 10-year-old children [Sandberg, Meyer Bahlburg, Ehrhardt, & Yager, 1993] found that approximately 23% of boys and 39% of girls showed 10 or more different gender-nonconforming behaviors. It is difficult to make inferences about the prevalence of adolescent gender nonconformity from these data, however, because there is evidence that, as children grow older and begin to perceive the social implications of gender nonconformity, they consciously modify their own behavior, sometimes becoming extremely gender stereotyped in order to avoid and compensate for prior stigmatization [Hunter, 1993]. Other gender-nonconforming adolescents may adopt transgender identities, which may entail adopting a cross-gender identification, an intermediate or dual-gender presentation, or the rejection of gender as a relevant identity category altogether [Denny, 2004; Diamond, Pardo, & Butterworth, 2011; Mallon & DeCrescenzo, 2006].Because mainstream culture continues to presume (and to communicate through various media sources) that gender nonconformity is a sign of homosexuality, adolescents may find it impossible to question their gender identity and performance without also questioning their sexual orientation and identity and vice versa. Hence, Arbeit's focus on the dynamic psychological and interpersonal processes driving sexual development would be greatly enhanced by greater attention to the interplay between gender and sexual questioning and how it plays out differently for youths with different constellations of \"atypical\" desires and atypical gender presentation. One reason to adopt this expanded focus is to enhance our basic understanding of the psychosexual development of transgender and gender-nonconforming (sometimes called gender-variant) adolescents more broadly. In contrast to the extensive body of research on conventional gender identity development [Ruble, Taylor, Cyphers, Greulich, Lurye, & Shrout, 2007], little research has focused on the basic developmental processes of transgender identity development in nonclinical populations [Gagné, Tewksbury, & McGaughey, 1997]. Historically, psychologists have expressed ambivalence about whether it is healthy for youths to embrace permanently liminal, flexible senses of gender instead of moving progressively toward the goal of consistently identifying as male or female [reviewed in Mallon & DeCrescenzo, 2006], yet Arbeit's model provides a framework for reconceptualizing gender questioning as adaptive and even normative.Specifically, to the extent that Arbeit's model suggests that healthy sexual development requires that youths actively interrogate, interpret, take responsibility for, and take ownership of their personal experiences of desire, perhaps healthy gender development similarly requires that youths actively interrogate, interpret, take responsibility for, and take ownership of their personal experience of gender. Similarly, to the extent that these agentic processes contribute to the development of a sexual ethics, they might similarly contribute to the development of \"gender ethics\" in which youths come to develop values and personal standards regarding all human beings' entitlement to dignity, integrity, and autonomy regarding their subjective experience of gender. Perhaps by fostering such an appreciation for \"gender dignity\" and \"gender ethics,\" we may be able to reduce youths' tendency to victimize and marginalize peers who fall short of the culture's restrictive standards regarding \"correct\" and/or \"normal\" female and male behavior.Another aspect of Arbeit's model which would benefit by more substantive attention to gender concerns the process of sexual negotiation. She aptly identifies sexual negotiation as a foundational sexual skill, but may not fully appreciate the role that these negotiations play in shaping youths' developing sense of gender as an interactional phenomenon. Because our culture rewards young men and women differently for expressing their feelings, asserting their goals, and exerting versus resisting influence, girls and boys will inevitably enter into sexual negotiations with gender-differentiated patterns of cognition and behavior. Yet a relational-developmental-systems perspective calls our attention to the fact that the dynamic links between gender and sexual negotiation are necessarily bidirectional. In other words, just as girls with certain expectations about \"appropriate\" female behavior will enter into sexual negotiations with certain biases and constraints, girls will also exit each such negotiation with updated beliefs, expectations, and feelings regarding their gender. In essence, gender does not simply influence adolescent sexual experience, it is also dynamically produced by adolescent sexual experience. For example, a girl who experiences a series of successes in negotiating tricky sexual interactions is likely to develop a sense of womanhood that is fully consistent with autonomy, need assertion, and feelings of competency and dignity in claiming one's right to pleasure and to one's own bodily boundaries. A girl whose sexual negotiations end poorly, and who finds herself the subject of blame, pressure, and shame, may develop a sense of womanhood that requires subjugating one's own will to male privilege and authority. Investigating such processes would expand the reach and significance of Arbeit's model and would permit a broader understanding of how youths begin to experience larger structures of power and privilege through the proximal context of dyadic sexual interactions.A strength of Arbeit's model is that she does not posit fundamentally different sexual-developmental processes for heterosexual versus sexual-minority (i.e., same-sex attracted) youth. Yet this inclusive approach risks losing sight of unique issues related to sexual orientation and identity that would enhance the applicability and scope of her model. For example, to the extent that the negative slant of previous research on adolescent sexuality has hindered our attempts to develop positive, health-enhancing interventions for youths, this weakness has been compounded for sexual-minority youths whose sexual feelings and needs have been viewed as even more dangerous, threatening, and potentially harmful than those of heterosexuals. For example, although there has been an impressive proliferation of outreach efforts (at the level of advocacy organizations, clinicians, teachers, etc.) aimed at addressing the psychosocial needs of sexual-minority youths, these efforts often take great care to avoid any impression that they are encouraging youth with same-sex attractions to act on their attractions and, instead, generally focus on \"safe\" issues such as the prevention of suicidality and antigay bullying. Hence, although society has reached consensus that sexual-minority youth should not face psychological or physical harm, it has not reached consensus on whether it is okay for these youths to actually express their sexuality.Arbeit's model has the potential to provide a powerful counterargument to this myopic approach. Her skill-based model suggests that we cannot expect youths to develop into ethical, responsible, positive, healthy sexual citizens if we deny them the opportunities to practice the critical skills of assessing, experiencing, analyzing, sharing, negotiating, and enjoying their sexual feelings, cognitions, and sensations. One might interpret Arbeit's model to suggest that it is impossible to foster healthy psychosocial development among sexual-minority youths if the very basis for their social marginalization - same-sex desire - is denied expression. Hence, antibullying efforts and gay-straight alliances must be undertaken in concert with efforts to provide sexual-minority youths with safe spaces to discuss, think about, and act on their same-sex desires, with ready access to the guidance, advice, and support of trusted adults (given that many such youths are alienated from their parents). Developing a sense of autonomy and sexual agency is critical for all youths but may prove even more important for youths whose sexuality is marginalized and denigrated by the culture at large.Another reason that Arbeit's model would profit by greater attention to questions of same-sex sexuality, and the unique stigmatization that it engenders in contemporary culture, is the simple fact that there is such greater variability in the expression of same-sex and other-sex desire and behavior during the adolescent years. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that 13% of American girls and 6% of American boys reported same-sex attractions, same-sex relationships, or nonheterosexual identities [Savin-Williams, 2005]. The National Survey of Family Growth, with a representative national sample of nearly 14,000 American individuals, found that 5.2% of male teenagers and 12.5% of female teenagers reported same-sex sexual contact [Chandra, Mosher, Copen, & Sionean, 2011]. Importantly, longitudinal research indicates that same-sex behavior in adolescence is not necessarily a precursor to a sexual-minority identity. Savin-Williams and Ream [2007] found that, among the adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health who reported same-sex behavior at wave 1 (at a mean age of 16), very few (1 in 5 females and 1 in 25 males) described themselves as \"homosexual,\" \"mostly homosexual,\" or \"bisexual\" by wave 3 (at a mean age of 22), and the overall percentage of youths adopting one of these descriptors was low (2.4% of males and 3.8% of females). Similarly, in the National Survey of Family Growth, 2.8% of 18- to 19-year-old males and 7.7% of 18- to 19-year-old females identified themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual [Chandra et al., 2011]. These findings accord with other research conducted with large samples of adolescents, indicating that the vast majority of youth reporting same-sex attractions or same-sex behavior present themselves as heterosexual [Garofalo, Wolf, Wissow, Woods, & Goodman, 1999; Mosher, Chandra, & Jones, 2005; Remafedi, Resnick, Blum, & Harris, 1992].Hence, although many researchers conceptualize adolescents as falling into two rough groups - a heterosexual group that shows no interest in same-sex activity and a gay and lesbian group that shows no interest in other-sex activity - this is simply inaccurate. Accordingly, we need models of adolescent sexual development capable of representing the incredible diversity of youths' trajectories of same-sex and other-sex desire and behavior during the adolescent years and which do not presume that the frequency, timing, or quality of these experiences necessarily predicts later sexual identification. The emphasis that Arbeit places on youths' autonomy, agency, and active construction of sexual selfhood renders her model well suited to make important contributions to our current understanding of the development of sexual orientation and identity during the adolescent years, and this remains one of the most promising applications of her model.A final area deserving of greater elaboration in Arbeit's model, and greater integration of a cascade approach, is the notion of sexual meaning-making and the process through which youths continually craft and revise their own sexual autobiographies. In Arbeit's model, meaning-making only receives specific attention in the context of sexual ethics, as youths reflect on and interpret their own personal experiences and come to apply the resulting insights to novel events [Smetana, 2006]. The critical role of meaning-making in sexual ethics derives from the fact that sexual ethics requires that youths sift through and evaluate their own experiences against the multiple, potentially competing messages communicated by parents, peers, the media, teachers, and church leaders in order to arrive at their own sense of sexual values and decision-making. Although Arbeit is right to place emphasis on the process of meaning-making in the context of the development of sexual ethics, she perhaps underestimates the critical role of meaning-making in sexual development more broadly and does not devote sufficient attention to its critical role within a dynamic, cascade approach to sexual development.For example, given her nuanced conceptualization of sexual desire as an experience which requires self-reflection and assessment of one's own physical, emotional, and cognitive reactions, meaning-making would appear to be central to this process. In other words, the very process of embodiment requires an interpretive framework. For youths to assess their subjective, embodied experiences and apply these assessments to their ongoing skill development, chronic processes of meaning-making must inevitably occur. In this respect, the growing body of research on autobiographical memory and narrative could potentially play an important role in expanding Arbeit's focus and providing new avenues for investigation. Specifically, when we think of the development of sexual selfhood, we would profit by conceiving of the sexual self as a narrative construction, one that is actively composed and revised over time in the context of changing motives and experiences and in light of youths' expanding base of knowledge and personal experience.A greater focus on autobiographical narrative and meaning-making is particularly relevant to cascade models of sexual development in which a youth's present subjective experience within a sexual interaction is fundamentally structured by the meanings attached to similar, previous experiences and feeds forward to shape future expectations, interpretations, and meanings. This process has great significance for adaptation and psychological growth: previous research has found that crafting meaningful understandings of both positive and negative life experiences helps individuals to cope with and learn from stressors and challenges, particularly if individuals use their experiences to derive insights that can guide their future choices and self-knowledge [McLean & Breen, 2009; McLean, Breen, & Fournier, 2010; McLean & Pasupathi, 2007]. Hence, youths who craft meaningful insights from stressful or disappointing sexual experiences, and who make an effort to determine what to do in the future to reduce the likelihood of such experiences, may actually show enhanced development relative to youths who cope with negative experiences by dismissing the thoughts and feelings they provoke.Greater attention to the cascading role of meaning-making may help to make sense of the mixed patterns of association that have been detected between sexual experience and adolescent well-being, with some studies showing greater happiness and self-esteem among more sexually experienced girls [Horne & Zimmer-Gembeck, 2005] and others showing the opposite [Ciairano, Bonino, Kliewer, Miceli, & Jackson, 2006]. The subjective quality and interpretation of youths' experiences may prove to be the key unmeasured variable. Hence, one potential extension of Arbeit's model might involve greater emphasis on how youths' motives, expectations, and interpretations of their successive sexual and romantic experiences shape their unfolding sexual-developmental trajectories over the course of adolescence in a cascading fashion such that youths' meaning-making processes drive future sexual decisions and experiences, and these experiences then feed forward to shape future meaning-making processes. This approach may allow us to investigate how and why youths transition from one type of sexual experience to another over the course of adolescence and how these experiences shape the overall development of their particular constellation of sexual desires, preferences, needs, fears, etc. Information on cascading relations between youths' experiences and their interpretations of these experiences is also particularly useful for understanding cases in which youths' trajectories change course, shifting from positive to negative experiences and vice versa, and such information is likely to be critically important for the development of health-promoting interventions for adolescents. Specifically, understanding and altering the types of interpretive frameworks that youths apply to both positive and negative sexual experiences may help to foster their sense of agency, help them to take ownership of their sexual phenomenology, and empower them to make positive changes in their emerging sexual selves.It bears noting that my critiques and suggested extensions of Arbeit's model testify to its utility. Importantly, Arbeit states clearly that her goal is not to provide a uniform \"answer\" to promoting positive sexual development in adolescence but to provide a generative roadmap to the types of questions and research agendas that might prove most fruitful. In this she has undoubtedly succeeded. Even her open acknowledgement of pleasure as a fundamental component of adolescent sexual development is strikingly novel. A recent search of the published psychological literature found over 3,000 journal articles with the words \"adolescent/ce\" and \"sexual/sexuality\" in the title, but only 31 included the word \"pleasure\" in the title or abstract. This reflects our culture's chronic ambivalence about sexual pleasure and its historical connotation with immorality and self-indulgence. Yet in Arbeit's model, pleasure plays an ever-present and fundamental role not only as a contributor to sexual needs and behaviors but also as a developmental achievement in and of itself with respect to youths' capacities to identify and enjoy sensations and feelings and link them up with a sense of fundamental entitlement to pleasure. Accordingly, her model has great potential to provide a much-needed corrective to the chronic sex negativity which has hindered models of adolescent sexuality as well as models of adult health and relationships [Diamond, 2013b; Diamond & Huebner, 2012]. The areas for potential expansion that I have highlighted simply indicate the broad applicability of her dynamic, skill-based approach and its potential to generate important new lines of inquiry into life span sexual development.",

      "abstract": "Der Artikel hinterfragt kritisch die in der Medizin verbreitete Vorstellung, dass Personen mit Intersexualitat nur dann eine befriedigende Sexualitat leben konnen, wenn ihre Geschlechtsorgane chirurgisch moglichst dem weiblichen oder mannlichen Geschlecht angepasst werden, sodass »heterosexueller« Geschlechtsverkehr moglich wird. Ergebnisse der Hamburger Studie zu Intersexualitat bestatigen den bisherigen Forschungsstand, dass die sexuelle Lebensqualitat von Personen mit Intersexualitat deutlich geringer ist als diejenige von Menschen mit eindeutigem Geschlecht. Somit ist das Ziel der Medizin, Personen mit Intersexualitat mittels geschlechtsangleichender Operationen eine moglichst »nonnale« psychosexuelle Entwicklung zu ermoglichen, bisher nicht erreicht worden. Die Autorinnen und Autoren pladieren dafur, den heterosexistischen Diskurs in der medizinischen Behandlung von Personen mit Intersexualitat zu uberdenken und vielmehr die sexuelle Lebensqualitat der betroffenen Menschen ins Zentrum zu rucken. Dies umfasst weit mehr als »heterosexuelles« Funktionieren und steht in einem Zusammenhang mit psychosozialen Faktoren wie beispielsweise positiven Bindungserfahrungen in der Kindheit oder einer tragenden Partnerschaft.",

Gender transgressions can incur severe penalties. The classification of behaviors as gender transgressions varies widely across cultures and time periods. In the field of gender studies, scholars have taken diverse approaches to the concept of gender transgression. Some scholars have focused on identifying forms of gender transgression and their ideological impact, whereas others have critiqued applications of gender transgression for mischaracterizing people of trans and/or non‐binary experience, enacting ethnocentrism and overlooking individual experiences such as the internal and unexpressed aspects of gender.",

Although appreciating the initiative of GIRES, the author, who was invited to join the signatories of the review chose to not do so for five major reasons: (1) The phenomenology of transgenderism displays such a great variety that it can not be explained by any individual factor, be it constitution, morphology, hormones or psychology. (2) The role of the Bed nucleus of the area striata of the hypothalamus is overemphasized in the review. (3) Regrets after SRS challenge biological explanations of transsexualism. (4) Dwelling on biological explanations may, as the history of sexology shows, be used in favor as well as against subject. (5) Striving for legal and social acknowledgement of transgendered persons and improvement of treatment conditions does not need biology as an argument.",

This entry, focused on the United States, addresses sexual minority both as a concept and as a term. The concept of a sexual minority can be traced to practices that medicalized, pathologized, psychologized, and bureaucratized homosexuality beginning in the late nineteenth century. In the United States, the term emerged as a self‐identification and in rights‐based discourses after World War II. “Sexual minority” circulates in but functions differently across contexts ranging from those focused on activism, medicine, social sciences, and law. Critiques have focused on the minoritizing function of the term, and the lingering traces of medicalization, as well as the ways in which the term can obscure sexual and gender fluidities, intersecting social locations, abilities, erotic justice, and pleasure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract.— Sexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as Yule V, Yule Q, YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined effects (PTI = PSI X PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation properties of the new statistics.",

In this chapter, we situate this emerging technology in the context of the history of reproductive technologies, and analyse the potential social and conceptual disruptions to which it could contribute. An ectogestative device, better known as “artificial womb”, enables the extra-uterine gestation of a human being, or mammal more generally. It is currently developed with the main goal to improve the survival chances of extremely premature neonates. We argue that the intended use of the technology in neonatal intensive care units, as an alternative to current incubators (“partial- ectogestation”), challenges concepts such as “birth”, “fetus”, and “neonate”, and has several ethico-legal implications. We moreover address a more futuristic scenario where the entire embryological and fetal development could happen within an artificial womb (“full-ectogestation”). Such a scenario reveals the disruption of gender roles, parenting practices, and concepts such as “mother”, “father”, and “parent”. Both full- and partial-ectogestation would have implications for engineering and design, law-making, ethics, and philosophical anthropology.",

      "abstract": "This article considers the role that clothing and fashion have played, or continue to play, in ‘sexualisation’. It is pointed out that fashion, as in clothing, has often played a very small part in much wider discussions about ‘sexualisation’ much of which fails to problematise the meaning of the clothing concerned. The article thus considers what might constitute ‘sexualised’ clothing or fashion – whether this is simply baring of flesh, too ‘adult’, or somehow ‘pornographic’ in its derivations or connotations. In addition, fashion and dress have a long history of forming heated concern for feminists who have often found themselves caught between seeing it as oppressive and male defined or expressive and somehow empowering. What is often at stake here is the very significance of fashion or dress itself when seen as a wider communicator of status or just personality. Drawing on established feminist and fashion theory, this article unpacks this connection. In addition, the ‘function’ of fashion as display has an equally long history of often unacknowledged gender difference that precedes later feminist resistance yet still informs it. The article also considers the extent to which understandings of fashion may inform or disrupt more contemporary feminist politics on dress, and recent attempts to reclaim ‘sexualised’ clothing and dressing as empowering for young women are questioned. In sum, it is argued that an analysis of fashion and dress per se is needed to develop a more informed understanding of the processes of ‘sexualisation’ and resistance to them.",

Moreover, it is a difficult question to tackle in horses as animals are dispersed in a variety of environmental conditions. There are some undirect indications based on comparisons of breeds or families. Behavioural similarities in animals issued from the same sire or belonging to the same breed are oberserved in foals and adult horses both in freely expressed behaviours (play, distance to the dam) as well as in reactions to experimental situations (emotional or learning tests). Stereotypic behaviours seem to appear more frequently in some breeds and / or families. The relative weight of environmental and genetic factors on the determinism of behavioural traits seems to differ according to the trait being considered. Moreover the observed differences between families or breeds can as well be related to epigenetic factors (maternal effect for example). It seems possible and promising to include behaviour in horse selection but it is necessary to have clear objectives in the trait seeked, the way it can be measured and to evaluate the impact of environmental factors.",

If we know little about the prostate, we know even less about the others.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Abortion, medically speaking, refers to the removal of fetus from the uterus before it has independent viability. Since fetus does not survive independently before sixth month of pregnancy, its removal from uterus before sixth month is considered abortion, and after sixth month it is not regarded as abortion if the fetus is born alive but it dies due to prematurity. Through the lens of Forensic Organization, abortion refers to removing the fetus from the uterus while it is not able to live outside the uterus, i.e. termination of pregnancy before fetus independent viability; this is usually realized until 20th week of pregnancy. So from a medical perspective, the important fact is that the aborted fetus cannot live independent from mother. Therefore if the fetus is removed from the uterus before due time and it can be kept alive by specific medical devices, it is not regarded as abortion. That is why abortion has always been raised by scholars as one the main issues of criminal law. Some feminists have absolutely accepted this social phenomenon and believe in an unconditional freedom. On the contrary, some do not regard abortion permissible under any conditions based on religious teachings. Islamic jurisprudents regard abortion permissible in a few cases. The Iranian legal system, whose rules are derived from Islamic jurisprudence, regards abortion prohibited and provides penalty according to the Islamic Penal Code, unlike legal systems of western societies that regard abortion as an honor for women personality and freedom. This paper studies types of abortion and the effective factors and evaluates and analyzes Abortion Law before and after the Islamic Revolution.",

      "abstract": "Puberty is a complex transition that involves dramatic changes in several domains of human development including biological, physical, psychological, and social [1]. Individual variations in the timing of puberty may influence the adoption of unhealthy behaviors. Specifically, compare to those who mature on-time or late, adolescents who mature early are at a higher risk of exposure to several psychological, social, and health disadvantages [2]. For instance, girls who experience puberty earlier than their counterparts are more susceptible to adverse health behavior such as earlier alcohol use [3], cigarette smoking [4], and eating disorder [5]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that early timing of puberty among girls is also associated with decline in physical activity (PA) [6], and an increased time spent in sedentary behavior (SB) [7]. Only a few studies have examined the relationship between puberty and body mass index (BMI) among boys by using different measures (e.g., voice break, age at onset of pubertal growth spurt, peak height velocity (PHV), public hair growth, testicular volume, and/or penis length), the results have been inconsistent [8]. However, a recent study examining the trend of age at spermarche and its association with BMI among Chinese school boys found that a higher BMI or BMI-for-age z-score was associated with an increased likelihood of having reached spermarche, indicating the overlapping trend of earlier age at spermarche and increase in BMI over the past 15 years among Chinese boys [9].",

      "title": "Asexuality: An Introduction for Questioning Clients",
      "abstract": "Asexuality—defined as the lifelong and nonpathological lack of sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender—is increasingly being recognized as a valid sexual orientation. For gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, this questioning phase is often triggered by feeling sexual attraction to someone of the same sex or gender; however, for asexual individuals, questioning may start with the realization that the person does not feel—and has never felt—sexual attraction to anyone, regardless of sex or gender. Thus, psychotherapists and other counselors have an ethical duty to respect their clients’ sexual orientation and not to discriminate against, deny service to, or demean clients on the basis of sexual orientation. Because asexuality is newly recognized as a sexual orientation, however, relatively few resources exist on cultural competency with asexual or potentially asexual clients. Finally, asexual individuals may have to navigate the implications of their asexuality in terms of cultural and social expectations for sex, relationships, and childbearing.",

The focus here is on oral sex within heterosexual relations, but oral sex plays an important part in homosexual relations. In some historical configurations of sexual practices in South Asia, for instance, the tasting of another man's semen was thought to stimulate the desire for heterosexual intercourse. In another configuration, fellatio was seen as a substitute for heterosexual intercourse, something to be received from a eunuch, but certainly not by a man from his wife. In the West, oral sex was often subject to legal prohibitions against “sodomy,” both hetero‐ and homosexual, and in some states in the US it remains a criminal offense.",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes 1. In his justification of his reversion to a nomenclature—“intersex conditions”—that has been abandoned in clinical practice in favor of “disorders of sexual development” (DSD), Sparrow claims that the former “allows more conceptual space for understanding these anatomic variations as points on a wider spectrum of sexual diversity than as—by definition—disorders of ‘normal’ anatomical development” (29). This betrays a lack of understanding of a clinical discourse that is used precisely to identify and responsibly manage the full anatomic and physiologic range of the biological variation of genomic, hormonal, brain, internal reproductive-organ, and genital sex and its resulting wide biopsychosocial variation in gender (Douglas et al. 2010; 2012; McCullough 2002). Sparrow's use of “intersex conditions” retains the dimorphic, biomedical, and therefore reductionist conception of sex in our species that the replacement nomenclature of “disorders of sexual development” has successfully left behind. As an unwelcome result, the conceptual space that he wants to preserve becomes restricted to the biomedical. The use of “intersex conditions” also results in Sparrow making the mistake of thinking that clinicians can assign gender to a pediatric patient with a DSD. Clinicians can assign sex (with varying levels of reliability—see Douglas et al. 2010; 2012; McCullough 2002) but they cannot assign gender, because the latter is a complex social construction of sex in both gender identity and sexual orientation. I therefore do not follow Sparrow in his use of “intersex conditions,” which should be discarded.",

      "title": "Chapitre 5. Les implications éthiques de la conservation des échantillons biologiques",
      "abstract": "The conservation and use of biological samples become more and more frequent all around the world. Biobanks of human body substances (blood, urine, DNA, tissues, cells, etc.), and personal data associated with them are created. They have a double character as they are collections of both human biological samples and personal data. In some cases, the gametes, reproductive tissues, embryos, foetal tissue after abortion or even specimens of dead donors are collected and conserved. Although biobanks raise hopes in both the development of new therapies, new drugs and their integration into clinical medicine, they also point to concerns related to ethical questions such as: the principles of information, the consent of the persons concerned, the confidentiality about the personal data, and in some cases discrimination and stigmatisation. Other ethical aspects could raise gradually as research advance. Research being carried out on human sample requires informed free consent from the person who should be able to consent. The donor must be sufficiently informed about the process of research, the purpose, benefits and the risks involved in participating in this research. In the case of persons unable to give consent such minors or persons with mental disabilities, special measures are undertaken. Once the consent was given, the right of withdrawal has been consistently supported by the various declarations and regulations, but some oppose this right for a number of reasons particularly in the case of research on the samples without risk of physical exposure. In this case the notion of human body integrity is different than in research involving therapeutic or clinical intervention. In the case of withdrawal of consent, the samples should be destroyed, but the anonymous results arising from them and their analysis are not affected. What is the case for future uses? Should the researcher obtain again the consent from the donor for a secondary use of the samples? This is a matter of debate in the public and scientific communities. In Morocco, research activities on humans are undertaken in the absence of legal framework. Among the ethical issues, the most frequent in Morocco are related to the informed and explicit consent. Illiteracy, which concerns half of the population, and the economic vulnerability of the largest proportion of the patient make the informed and explicit consent questionable. In this paper we aimed to describe the use and conservation of human biological samples in Morocco and to determine the ethical questions raised in this context. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to biologists working in the different laboratories. The response rate was only 59.2%. The human biological samples are generally used for diagnosis and clinical follow-up. The storage period ranged from 3 months to 1 year, it does not exceed one year. The percentage of conservation of biological samples in the laboratory for one year is 67% and no basic criterion is maintained in the selection of samples. All laboratories obtained their samples directly from patients; no exchange or duplicate samples were undertaken between institutions. The analyses performed on the stored samples are biochemical and immunological. The genetic analyses accounted for only 35% of the total samples. The laboratories involved a researcy activity accounted for only 13.6%. Some of them answered they had not obtained in a systematic manner the consent of the persons concerned. These results indicated a lack of information and guidance on bioethics in Morocco.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As the most frequently reported form of mood disturbance, depression is said to be the “common cold” of emotional distress. Sadness is a common, human response to loss, failure, rejection, or disappointment. This sadness can be profound, as it may be after the death of a loved one. However, sadness is not depression unless it becomes complicated by negative feelings about our futures and our selves. Depressed people feel badly about themselves, they blame themselves for things going wrong in their lives, and they have trouble imagining a better future. Depression that is clinically meaningful involves physical symptoms as well, including changes in appetite, energy levels, and sleeping patterns. Depression is usually preceded by one or more highly stressful life events, which typically involve loss or devaluation, such as the break up of a relationship, or failure at school or work (Brown &amp;Harris, 1978). Even positive life events can entail an element of loss and so risk depressed mood. For instance, when women first become mothers, they may be overjoyed by the baby’s birth but at the same time feel that they have lost freedom and control over their lives.",

Research will be an essential part of this evolution.\r\n\r\nThere is also an urgent need of education of young promising psychiatrists, learning the complexity of interactions between the psycho-social aspect and the biological one in psychiatry, but also the necessity using of a rigorous methodology.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of topics which need to be investigated in social psychiatry. Some of the most important are:\r\n\r\n- Migration and mental health, especially on the seemingly higher prevalence of schizophrenia among some groups of migrants;\r\n\r\n- Religion, spirituality and mental health; as a matter of fact, they will play an increasing role in the future in the expression of psychopathology, and in psycho-social phenomena such as violence, substance abuse...\r\n\r\n- Women's mental health, especially peri-natal mental health and psychiatry;\r\n\r\n- Ethics and its relative relativity from one culture to another in psychiatric daily practice.",

In fact, it is difficult to imagine sexual behaviors that do not involve some forms of proprioceptive and tactile content and certainly the lack of this information would make most of our experiences in this domain much less satisfying. However, despite of these consideration the role of touch in driving or complementing our sexual behaviour are among the least studied in cognitive neuroscientific research. This topic has relatively more recently started to be tackled by researchers. In particular, the relative role of different body sites, neural pathways, neurophysiological responses, cultural factors, and their reciprocal relationship, in driving our sexual experiences have begun to be better understood.",

Given these circumstances, this study investigates whether pain is a legitimated phenomenon and considers the processes involved in the creation of such a status. This is an exploratory investigation based on semi-structured interviews with people suffering from chronic pain as a consequence of physical, psychological, emotional, or social circumstances. Our principal objective is to explore the fundamental elements of legitimacy and the processes that bring it into being—i.e., to understand how it is socially constructed. The main finding, however, is that many sufferers of chronic physical, psychiatric/psychological, emotional and social pain perceive that their pain is not considered legitimate when no clear cause can be identified, when the pain prevents them from developing the norms imposed by social roles or when it inhibits them to make a productive contribution to the society in which they live. This is generally due to the disruptive aspect of pain and its impact on the social structure, specifically on productivity, which nowadays constitutes a key element in the legitimation of any social phenomenon.",

A theory/practice divide has been identified: that is, while health professionals may feel that sexual expression should be included as part of their role, they often do feel confident or competent enough to practice in this area[2]. The issues at the heart of this theory/practice divide were explored in an extensive study into the relationship between sexual expression, physical disability and professional practice.\r\n\r\nThe study design was developed following consultation with several voluntary organisations including the MS Trust and a number of individuals living with a disability. Their feedback indicated that sexual expression for people with disabilities was closely aligned to self esteem and quality of life. Despite it being a high priority concern for many people there was no clear avenue for advice and support when disability impacted on sexual expression and intimacy. Many individuals reported that sexual expression was simply not on the health or social care agenda.\r\n\r\nIn seeking the views of people whose sexual expression was affected by their condition, it became evident that while information on strategies, medication and equipment was helpful, it was the wider emotional aspects of sexual expression that were more important. For example, they suggested support would be helpful in finding social opportunities to establish relationships or in emotionally adjusting to sexual changes caused by the disability. Issues were highlighted around the timing of help, working with the couple, or removing barriers to mainstream counselling and sexual health services.\r\n\r\nBased on findings from this collaboration, the study focused on care that is provided in the community rather than the hospital setting, and as part of a multidisciplinary team as opposed to a single profession.",

      "title": "Biological Factors in the Development of Sexual Orientation",
      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this chapter is to review evidence on the role of biological factors in the development of sexual orientation from sources as diverse as studies of lateral preference, cognitive abilities, and anthropometry. Homosexuality is a sexual attraction to someone of the same anatomical sex; heterosexuality is a sexual attraction to someone of the opposite sex. Closely allied to sexual attraction is fantasy. If someone has sexual fantasies about others of the same sex, then the fantasies are homosexual; if someone has sexual fantasies about others of the opposite sex, then the fantasies are heterosexual. If a person’s sexual attractions and fantasies are primarily homosexual, then that person may be labeled “lesbian” or” gay.” Conversely, if a person’s sexual attractions and fantasies are primarily heterosexual, then that person may be labeled “heterosexual.” When attraction and fantasy are directed to members of both sexes, a person may be labeled “bisexual.” Attraction and fantasy are not the only dimensions that could be used to define a person as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual, but they are typically the most reliable. Physiological responses to erotic stimuli are one alternative, but men and women respond differently to stimuli of different sensory modalities (Laan &amp; Everaerd, 1995), thereby rendering difficult unambiguous comparisons between men and women. Same-sex sexual behavior or opposite-sex sexual behavior could serve as another criterion for sexual orientation, but personal and environmental constraints on sexual activity restrict its usefulness. Asking individuals whether they would self-identify lesbian, gay, or bisexual is another possibility, but this has the limitation that responses to this question are often based on social and political aspects of homosexuality and not sexual desire. Nonetheless, attraction/ fantasy, physiological responses, behavior, and self-identity are significantly, but not perfectly, positively correlated.",

      "abstract": "People with intellectual, cognitive, and psychosocial disabilities systematically and routinely lose their legal capacity – or their right to decide – when legal authority is vested in others to make decisions for them through guardianship or substitute decision-making. They also lose power over their lives more informally through everyday paternalism and the structural violence, constraints, institutionalisation, and abuse they experience at hugely disproportionate rates. The assumption that because of their disability some people simply do not have the cognitive abilities to exercise choice and control over their lives, and as a result must be restricted in the name of protection, is at the root of the ableism that pervasively shapes their lives. People with disabilities have been subject to, violated, and harmed by these ableist assumptions for centuries, and they underlie the legal and social justification for restricting or obstructing their right to legal capacity and liberty.",

The most common reactions include: attempt to take responsibility of\r\nthe loved ones, attempts “to deserve the love”, pushing their own needs on the back\r\nburner of their interests, strong emotional attachment to a partner with exclusion of\r\nadmitting the existence of the disease, loss of self-identity and lack of perception of\r\nown feelings and needs.

      "abstract": "How do adults experience and manage their sexual desires, when these desires are laden with shame, guilt or religious transgression? This study looked at a group of 15 heterosexual, single adult men in the Orthodox Jewish community whose religious laws explicitly prohibit them from both masturbating and from expressing all forms of premarital physical intimacy. When these religious laws are internalized, the person can encounter a unique set of conflicts that can significantly impact his relationships, religiosity, and emotional well-being. Interviews focused on the different ways that men navigated these conflicts over the course of development. Findings point to 3 distinct conflict/defense positions that represent advancing developmental stages on the road to “sexual ownership”: (1) sexual disembodiment, during which the person’s desires are felt as irrational and senseless outside forces, split off from their otherwise purpose-driven self; (2) sexual internalization, where desire is felt as an anxiety-laden but tolerable part of the self, and the person manages his intrapsychic conflicts using a variety of mature defense; and (3) sexual integration, where the person accepts their sexual desire as an important part of the self that can be linked to other motives, needs, and conflicts. The factors that facilitate and obstruct the sexual ownership process are discussed. The generalizability of this process to other populations is considered, and clinical recommendations are provided for therapists who encounter sexual ownership problems in their patients.

Frequencies of social behaviour are known to change with change in the predominant activity. As an obvious example, grooming tends to be more frequent during rest periods than when the animals are moving and feeding. However, the possibility that patterns, as opposed to frequencies, of social interaction could change through the day has rarely been mentioned, let alone considered in detail. Data from a two-year field study of wild mountain gorilla, show that patterns of social interaction do indeed change with the predominant maintenance activity : neglect of such variation can lead to, at best, ignorance of interesting facets of behaviour and, at worst, misleading conclusions about the social relationships of the study animals.",

Usualmente le MGF vengono distinte in diverse tipologie. Tipo I: Incisione o ablazione del prepuzio clitorideo. Tipo II: Asportazione o piu propriamente escissione del prepuzio clitorideo e/o di tutto il clitoride, con asportazione parziale o totale delle piccole labbra. Tipo III: Escissione completa del prepuzio clitorideo, delle piccole labbra e cruentazione delle grandi labbra, che vengono fatte aderire in modo da cicatrizzarle unite, ricoprendo meato uretrale ed introito vaginale. Costituisce l'infibulazione propriamente detta, ‘l’infibulazione faraonica’. Nonostante le mutilazioni genitali femminili vengano molto spesso considerate parte di alcune religioni, in realta esse hanno una valenza puramente culturale e sociale. Recentemente, e stata promulgata la Legge 09/01/2006 n. 7, recante “Disposizioni concernenti la prevenzione e il divieto delle pratiche di mutilazione genitale femminile”, strumento legislativo con un duplice intento: ‘formativo’ e ‘repressivo’. Vengono quindi analizzati i limiti di questa Legge, ovvero fino a che punto e possibile e soprattutto giusto reprimere, forzare o imporre? E’ nel convincimento che i nostri modelli sociali e culturali siano migliori, la chiave dell’eradicazione? O piuttosto nell’educazione e nell’aiuto? La questione e aperta per molte riflessioni.",

Following a familiar life course arc, older people should hypothetically release the possessions that equipped the daily lives that they no longer have.We use new survey data on possession divestment from the 2010 Health and Retirement Study to assess activity on behalf of the material convoy after age 50.After age 50, people are progressively less likely to divest themselves of belongings. After age 70, about 30% of persons say that they have done nothing in the past year to clean out, give away, or donate things, and over 80% have sold nothing. We tested whether divestments diminish with age because they do not seem necessary or because of health limitations, but the age pattern is robust, suggesting retention of the material convoy in later life.Further research on this age pattern might consider housing, the construction of the self, and social networks as explanations for retention. Inertia toward the material convoy maintains the availability and comfort of things, but it may also lead to a predicament wherein the collection becomes a worry for self and others.",

Characteristics were taken as the size of breasts, wide hips, facial and body Morphometric traits and selection of spices.

The physician's attitude is hardly more enlightened. He treats the pervert (paraphiliac) with contempt and speaks of him as a degenerate, though the term carries a connotation of moral opprobrium that has no place in medical work.

Der Gesang von Weibchen wurde als selten und funktionslos, zuweilen auch als Resultat von physiologischen Fehlfunktionen interpretiert. Obwohl weibliche Singvogel komplexe Gesange ausbilden konnen, ist dennoch wenig uber deren Funktionen und deren evolutiven Hintergrund bekannt. Bisher haben nur einige wenige Studien gezeigt, dass Weibchengesange meist in ahnlichen Funktionen dienen wie die der Mannchen, namlich: (i) Territorialverhalten, (ii) Partnerwahl (intersexuelle Selektion) und (iii) Konkurrenzverhalten gegenuber dem gleichen Geschlecht (intrasexuelle Selektion). \r\nDies lasst die Vermutung zu, dass Weibchen ein typisch mannliches Verhalten annehmen, sobald klassische Geschlechterrollen nicht mehr zutreffen, sie hohem Konkurrenzdruck ausgeliefert sind, Ressourcenknappheit herrscht oder die Mannchen nicht anwesend sind. Jedoch haben einige erst kurzlich durchgefuhrte Studien diese Funktionen angezweifelt und angedeutet, dass Weibchengesange auch in Funktionen dienen konnen, die von den Gesangen mannlicher Singvogel bisher nicht bekannt sind. \r\n\r\nMeine Studienart ist der Prachtstaffelschwanz (Malurus cyaneus), ein in Australien haufiger Singvogel mit einem komplexen Sozial- und Paarungssystem. Vermutlich im Zusammenhang mit dieser ausgepragten Sozialstruktur, singen die Weibchen dieser Art komplexe, vom Partner unabhangige, Gesange.\r\nIm Rahmen meiner PhD-Arbeit habe ich untersucht ob die Entwicklung dieser Sologesange durch sexuelle Selektionsmechanismen, im klassischen Sinne, im Laufe der Evolution erhalten wurden oder ob andere, weniger bekannte Mechanismen dahinter stehen. Der wichtigste Aspekt meiner Arbeit war weitere Informationen mit Hilfe von Experimenten zu gewinnen und das Verstandnis rund um die Funktionen von Gesangen weiblicher Singvogel zu erweitern.\r\nZuletzt werde ich in einer Studie zeigen, das auch der Weibchengesang einer europaischen Singvogelart, namlich von Blaumeisen (Cyanistes caeruleus), in einem neuen bisher kaum beschriebenen Kontext vorkommen kann.",

Extending prior work highlighting differences in SSS between discrete sexual orientation identity groups, we investigated associations between multiple aspects of SSS and attraction patterns among 602 young adults with a range of sexual orientations. Generally, there were more similarities than differences in SSS across individuals with monosexual vs. bisexual patterns of attraction. However, a few significant effects emerged, with significant differences across sex/gender. For women, the greatest differences were seen between romantic self-schema in women with asexual vs. non-asexual patterns of attractions, while women with bisexual attractions were relatively similar to those with monosexual attractions (either exclusively heterosexual or same-sex/gender attracted). For men, however, the greatest differences were seen between open/liberal self-schema in exclusively same-sex/gender attracted men vs. either bisexual or heterosexually attracted men. Broadly, these findings point to subtle sex/gender differences in how bisexual attractions interact with one’s conceptualization of one’s sexual self. Also, a non-trivial portion (22%) of participants reported attractions to gender non-binary people, and these attractions significantly predicted different SSS, suggesting the need to measure attractions outside of the gender binary.",

Yet despite this unprecedented revolution, obsolete expectations about motherhood persist. Excessive pressure to comply with impossible prescriptions leads to the breakdown of intimate relationships within small insulated nuclear families. However, little practical assistance and support is available for the powerful upheavals and often contradictory demands of parenting. It is argued that babycare is predisposed to reactivate deep feelings, due to contagious resonance with archaic experience. Lack of lack of realistic preparation render primary carers (of whatever gender) particularly susceptible to emotional disturbance, which arises in the gap between false beliefs and actual experience. Regardless of sound evidence of the financial cost-effectiveness of investing in the perinatal period and early years to safeguard the future mental health of the nation, over the past decade social provisions have declined, and far from making progress, our essential services are deteriorating.",

A sample of 52,588 adults were asked what percentage of the time they reached orgasm when they were sexually intimate during the past month, heterosexual men reported orgasming 95% of the time in contrast to only 65% of heterosexual women [2]. This is termed the orgasm gap. One cause of the orgasm gap is that although the typical woman needs about 15 minutes of stimulation to achieve orgasm during penile-vaginal-intercourse [3, 4], a typical man needs less than 6 minutes [5]. This fact suggests that men often reach orgasm before his female partner has, leading to the orgasm gap.",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Kama or sexuality is the root of procreation. Every married couple’s dream of getting their own progeny is initiated, mediated, and formulated through this Kama. This is possible when the anatomical structures and physiological functions of sex organs of both partners are intact. Otherwise, the whole intention becomes in vain. In nutshell, Kama affects in sexual gratification and better progeny to lead happy life, which is perturbed in the absence of the same. Kama is the third pursuit of the man (purushartha) also. The inability to procreate, i.e., infertility is such a condition, which severely affects the couple’s psychological harmony, sexual life, and social stigma and ultimately leads to separation from life partner and many a time to suicide. According to Ayurveda, Shukra should possess such a potency so as to conceive a lady. The impact of defective Shukra is infertility. Although, in Ayurveda, many effective remedies for this disease are mentioned without any known side effects, a major drawback attribute to these remedies is that they involve laborious treatment procedures such as Shodhana procedures, where the patient has to be hospitalized and they have to follow strict diet and regimen during these procedures and these procedures are more time consuming also. Materials and Methods: In the present study, the subjects were randomly selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, specifically designed, and were randomly placed into two Groups, namely Group A and Group B containing 15 subjects each. Subjects of both Groups were given internally Hareetakyadi Choorna for Mala Shodhana and till the Nirama Lakshana was obtained. Later, the subjects of Group A and Group B were given Ashwagandhadi and Shatavaryadi Choorna, respectively, for 2 months along with Ksheera as Sahapana internally. The follow-up period for both the groups was 2 months. Results: The assessment was done before the treatment, soon after the completion of the course of the treatment and after the follow-up period, and thus, the total assessment was done based on the change in improvement observed, before and after the treatment. Conclusion: On seeing the comparative efficacy of Group A and Group B, it is found that Group A is much effective on parameters such as Dourbalya, Mukhashosha, Shrama, Sadana, Pandu, Sperm Count, Liquefication time, and sluggish sperms whereas Group B is more effective on parameters such as volume, motile sperms, and non-motile/dead sperms.",

      "abstract": "1. The Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta was assented to March 21, 1928. 2. Up to the end of 1933, 288 cases—87 males and 201 females—had been passed by the Eugenics Board, and are dealt with in this report. Of these 206—48 males and 158 females—had at that time been operated on. 3. These operations—a vasectomy or salpingectomy—have been followed by no serious sequelæ. 4. No complaints have been received as to any change in libido or sex satisfaction, and none are expected. 5. Of the 288 cases 156, or 54.2 per cent, were diagnosed as mentally defective; 36, or 12.5 per cent, as mental deficiency with psychosis and 87, or 30.2 per cent, as otherwise psychotic and 9, or 3.1 per cent, as borderline cases including one with an exceedingly bad family history though otherwise normal. 6. Social problems, such as immorality, illegitimacy, delinquency, dependence, partial or complete, were prominent features in many of the histories. 7. Contrary to frequently expressed fears there is at present no evidence that sterilization will lead to promiscuity or a lowering of moral standards. 8. On the other hand, the treatment and training of patients and the maintenance of an adequate follow up system are still essential. 9. Facts indicating an hereditary taint or predisposition, in many cases to a startling extent, were found in 60.8 per cent of cases. 10. Sexual sterilization is undoubtedly a logical and acceptable method of coping with the great problems of mental disease and defect and their associated problems and should in properly selected and safeguarded cases be as readily resorted to as similar operations for physical disease.",

With eye tracking, 2-month olds' (N = 101; 44 females) social orienting to faces was measured within four-item image arrays. Infants were more likely to detect human faces compared to objects, suggesting a functional face detection system. Unexpectedly, males looked longer at human faces than females, and only males looked faster and longer at human faces compared to objects. Females, in contrast, looked less at human faces relative to animal faces and objects, appearing socially disinterested. Notably, this is the first report of a male face detection advantage at any age. These findings suggest a unique stage in early infant social development.",

After all, genital stimulation, whether by a man or a woman, sends the same sensory signals to the brain. Yet somehow the sex, appearance, and identity of the person providing the stimulation are all critical determinants of whether or not the stimulation is perceived as pleasurable. Many people, heterosexual and homosexual alike, are strongly attracted to only one of the two sexes. And, all things being equal, most people would prefer an attractive partner to an unattractive one. Even then, whether or not pleasure is experienced is significantly influenced by who the attractive, appropriately sexed pleasure-giver is, not to mention the context in which the stimulation occurs. Certain partners, such as family members, arc taboo. Others arc considered undesirable, or even repulsive, for whatever reason.",

      "abstract": "It is not rare, among professionals working with adolescents, to hear certain remarks directed against young people who have imposed their sexuality on others. Signifiers such as “predator,” “pedophile,” and “pervert” may be used, even though it is clinically necessary to take the time to determine what factors compelled the teenager to act, before “labeling” him/her. Based on two clinical cases, this article reflects on the “sexual act” in two of its forms, fraternal incest and sibling sexual abuse. Incest takes place in a fusional, symbiotic relationship between two people, both of whom, at least for a while, find satisfaction in it. Passion is central to it, as is the enjoyment of an exclusive relationship. In sibling abuse, on the other hand, the notions of influence over the other and omnipotence are uppermost in the mind of the perpetrator. One can hardly differentiate the two at the level of material facts and the behavior of those involved; it is only on the plane of the psychic defenses that the nuances are noticeable. We therefore propose to examine the aspects of splitting present in both cases.",

      "title": "ESTIMATING SEXUAL SELECTION AND SEXUAL ISOLATION EFFECTS FROM MATING FREQUENCIES",
      "abstract": "Sexual selection (defined as the change in genotypic or phenotypic frequencies of mated versus total population frequencies) and sexual isolation (defined as the deviation from random mating in mated individuals) show different evolutionary consequences and partially confounded causes. Traditionally, the cross-product estimator has been used to quantify sexual selection, whereas a variety of indexes, such as Yule V, Yule Q, YA, joint I, and others have been used to quantify sexual isolation. Because the two types of estimators use different scales, the effects of both processes cannot be monitored simultaneously. We describe three new related statistics that quantify both sexual selection (PSS) and sexual isolation (PSI) effects for every mating pair combination in polymorphic traits, as well as measure their combined effects (PTI = PSI × PSS). The new statistics have the advantage of providing information on every mating pair combination, quantifying the effects of sexual selection and isolation in the same units, and detecting asymmetry in sexual isolation. The ability of the new statistics to ascertain the biological causes of sexual selection and sexual isolation are investigated under different models involving distinct marginal frequencies, mate propensity, and mate choice coefficients. We also studied the use of classical isolation indexes applied on PSI coefficients, instead of on raw data. The use of the classical indexes applied to PSI coefficients considerably reduces the statistical bias of the estimates, revealing the good estimation properties of the new statistics.Corresponding Editor: E.

De maniere egalement attendue la difference est bien marquee entre les femmes mariees, condamnees a l'anonymat, et les veuves, qui retrouvent leur nom. Dans les deux cas leur statut social se definit a partir de celui de leur mari, qui seul est recense avec sa profession. Les mentions de metier assignees a des femmes, celibataires ou parfois veuves, bien plus nombreuses en ville qu'a la campagne, le sont generalement par defaut. L'inscription professionnelle n'est pas signe de reconnaissance, ne met pas en exergue une forme d'emancipation, ne definit pas non plus une identite. Soit elle decrit, faute de mieux, les activites d'actrices qui n'ont pas leur place dans la hierarchie et l'organisation en corps, soit elle renvoie a la condition de domestique avec tout ce qu'elle comporte d'inferiorite, de mepris et d'anonymat. Aussi les occupations professionnelles feminines, servantes, couturieres, revendeuses..., qui apparaissent dans les roles sont-elles situees tout au bas de l'echelle sociale dans la majeure partie des cas. Seules quelques denominations tres ponctuelles, telles metayere ou boulangere, rendent peut-etre compte d'une situation differente, ou s'exprimerait une forme d'autonomie economique.

It was hypothesized that these emotional problems may be mirrored by physical intimacy problems such that child molesters would show exaggerated disgust reactions to the thought of coming into physical contact with adults, but not children. It was demonstrated that the discomfort shown by both offenders and non-offenders at the prospect of coming into contact with the bodily fluids of another person increases in relation to the age of the person that the bodily fluid came from. Furthermore, child molesters, in comparison to non-offenders and violent offenders, showed excessive concern at the thought of being touched on the lips or tongue with a re-sterilized surgical swab. These exaggerated anxieties combined withthe implicit belief that children are less contaminating than adults could add to the drive for child molesters to seek physical intimacy with children.",

      "title": "[The long good-bye--paths of psychoanalysis in late adolescence].",
      "abstract": "These reflections about late adolescence are inspired by a novel by Peter Handke, entitled \"Der kurze Brief zum langen Abschied\" (original; translated: A short letter about the long good-bye). The protagonist's troublesome and painful separation from his wife taking place during a trip through the United States is interpreted as an attachment-conflict towards the mother that has not been dissolved during late adolescence. The essential characteristic of late adolescence is taking one's final leave from the infantile and adolescent parental imagines and the reapproachment to the real parents. In case of a failure late adolescence may easily lead to a syndrome of rejection or of overadjustment or of drop-out-identity. Especially in the rejection or in the drop-out-identity one can find object-relationships resembling those found in narcicistic or borderline-disorders. In many cases these adolescents lack the transitional scope they would have needed to find their way to autonomy or to the ability of containing (BION).",

With this in mind, the legal term \"corpse\" was examined on the basis of German State Law regulations and provisions. Approximately half the burial acts include a definition of \"corpse\", but even here there are certain variations. The definitions for \"corpse\" can be divided into four categories: 1) according to the lack of vital signs or sure signs of death 2) according to the degree of decomposition and/or cohesion of body parts 3) on the basis of severed body parts, and 4) terminological differentiation of stillbirths and neonatal fatalities from miscarriages. Laws vary greatly in their definition of the term \"corpse\". Therefore, the decision whether or not human remains or parts thereof qualify as a \"corpse\" should be left to medical discretion.",

I present 34 hours of audio recordings from 2239 authentic sexual episodes shared online, each with one vocalizer (1950 female, 289 male). Both acoustic features and arousal ratings from a perceptual experiment follow an inverted-U curve, revealing the likely time of orgasm. Sexual vocalizations become longer, louder, more high-pitched, voiced, and unpredictable at orgasm in both men and women. Men are not less vocal overall, but women start moaning at an earlier stage; speech or even minimally verbalized exclamations are uncommon. While excessive vocalizing sounds inauthentic to listeners, vocal bursts at peak arousal are ubiquitous and less verbalized than in the build-up phase, suggesting limited volitional control. Human sexual vocalizations likely include both consciously controlled and spontaneous moans of pleasure, perhaps best understood as sounds of liking rather than signals specific to copulation.",

      "abstract": "Maturation assessment is an important issue within sports practice by children and adolescents. In the first two decades of life, children and adolescents experience three interactive processes: growth, maturation and development. The first process refers to physical size and proportions; the second refers to skeletal, reproductive, somatic, neuroendocrine and neuromuscular functions; the third refers to cognitive, emotional, social, motor and moral issues. This text aimed to review the methods to assess the maturation of children and adolescents, describing their main characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. The maturation of the various organ systems occurs at different rates and times, leading us to conclude that the assessment of the state of biological maturity varies within the body system taken into consideration. The efficiency of a given strategy is directly linked to its ability to identify the different stages of sexual maturation. Systems most commonly used for evaluation of maturation are reproductive (sex) and somatic. Dental maturation (calcification and eruptions) is occasionally used, but tends to behave independently of the other three systems. Hormonal maturation influences all these aspects and should also be considered. However, skeletal maturity (bone age) seems to gather more advantages in determining the maturational stage of youth compared to the others, even if they are in peripuberal period.",

El riesgo de pederastia deriva de un problema de insatisfaccion sexual y de un contacto permanente con los jovenes. El sacerdocio puede ser una coartada inconsciente para la homosexualidad y la pedofilia (homosexualidad primaria), pero, en otros casos, estos pueden ser resultado de un celibato dificil de soportar a lo largo de la vida (homosexualidad secundaria). La forma de hacer compatibles las normas de conciencia estrictas con las conductas de depravacion ha sido mediante el recurso a las distorsiones cognitivas justificativas del abuso sexual. El celibato obligatorio, las distorsiones cognitivas del abusador y el encubrimiento de la jerarquia han hecho posible la extension de este fenomeno. EnglishThe sexual offenders who pertain to the clergy are a minority, but they cause a particularly damaging emotional harm to the victims and they provoke strong social rejection. The risk of pederasty derives from a problem of sexual dissatisfaction and from the fact of having permanent contact with youngsters. Priesthood can be an unconscious alibi for homosexuality and paedophilia (primary homosexuality), but, in some other cases, the aforementioned can be the result of a celibacy which is difficult to endure for a lifetime (secondary homosexuality). They have resorted to cognitive distortions which justify sexual abuse in order to make the strict conscience norms compatible with the conducts of depravity. The compulsive celibacy, the cognitive distortions of the offender and the cover-up by the hierarchy have made it possible for this phenomenon to expand. francaisLes delinquants sexuels appartenant au clerge sont une minorite, mais ils causent un prejudice emotionnel particulierement nocif aux victimes et ils generent un fort rejet social.

      "title": "Lesbian Dating and Courtship from Young Adulthood to Midlife",
      "abstract": "Summary Lesbian dating and courtship were explored based on interviews with 38 predominantly white lesbians (ages 22-63) representing young adult, adult, and midlife age groups. Friendship was found to be the most widely used courtship script across all age groups, followed by the sexually explicit and romance scripts, with friendship and romance scripts being preferred. Unique aspects of lesbian dating cited by participants included freedom from gender roles, heightened intimacy/friendship, the rapid pace of lesbian relationship development, and the effects of prejudice. Friendship was found to be differentiated from romance by two main criteria: emotional intensity and sexual energy or contact. Verbal declarations of interest and nonverbal behaviors were the primary means of communicating sexual attraction. Few lesbians adhered to traditional gender roles in dating, and those who reported assuming the feminine reactive role nevertheless rejected the traditional notion that women should limit sexual contact. Overall, midlife lesbians were more purposive in their dating and more free from gender roles. Specifically, they were more concerned about the \"attachment-worthiness\" of a prospective partner and were significantly more likely than young adults to view dating as having a serious goal, to proceed at a rapid pace, to ask for a date, and to initiate physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Criminality is an extremely heterogeneous social phenomenon that includes various kinds of deviant behavior. It also includes sexual criminality (crimes against sexual freedom and moral), which has highly negative impact on society and endangers the most intimate parts of a person’s life. The aim of this survey is to outline a structure of psychological features of sexual offenders, to determine the degree of their development and the way in which they are connected, as well as to describe certain social and sociological phenomena that are typical of sexual offenders. The results that have been achieved during this survey will successfully be implemented into the practical work of penal institutions in the Republic of Macedonia in order to ensure successful resocialisation and reintegration of sexual offenders in the society. Our experience and knowledge are compatible with world-wide trends saying that sexual offenders are mentally healthy people and that they cannot be included in any diagnostic category. The main results of this survey can be summed up into several points: in general, sexual offenders are male, aged between 26 and 33, with minimal education and without profession or employment. Usually, they do not behave in pathological manner and they are mentally healthy people. It is believed that resocialisation as well asa complex treatment will be necessary for people convicted of sexual offences: not only will it represent prevention from committing new crimes, it will also be a breeding ground for their active participation in life out of the penal institutions.",

Seasonality also occurs in processes such as dormancy, diapause, hibernation, and migration which, while not directly involved in the reproductive cycle, have profound effects on it. The primary adaptive advantage to be gained from seasonal reproductive activity is, of course, the temporal coincidence of the arrival of offspring with the maximum availability of nutrients to carry them through the rapid growth of the early stages of their lives. To insure this coincidence, the timing of reproductive events must be controlled by factors in the environment which are temporally related to the availability of nutrients. Other things being equal, the most useful controlling factor will be the one with the least variance in its temporal relationship with the food supply. However, because considerable time usually elapses between the initiation of reproductive activity and the appearance of the young, an ideal controlling factor should initiate reproductive activity at an appropriate time in advance of the best time for rearing the young. Environmental factors which satisfy these criteria are not numerous. On a priori",

      "abstract": "The development of a boy's sex role begins shortly after birth when he is assigned certain colors due to his gender. By the time the boy is eighteen months old, adults are expecting clear sex differences in his behavior. Subtle and not so subtle pressure is put on the child to produce sex differences. The pressure is from a wide variety of sources such as type of toys purchased, clothing provided, decoration of his room, and his interactions with family members and other significant adults. Consequently the boy's preference for guns, wheeled toys, running, and aggressive play appears at or before age three. By the time the boy enters elementary school at age six, he has a strong notion of the masculine behaviors expected of him. Modification of sex roles to accommodate the expectations of the school is one of the more difficult tasks facing elementary school aged boys. As they enter school, boys are required to assume a second role, that of a student. However, the behaviors implicit in many boys' sex roles are oppositional to the behaviors required in the student role. The conflict results in the boy not successfully assuming the student role, and may result in the boy being identified as having an academic and/or behavioral problem. Considerable research indicates that a large percentage of boys are experiencing difficulties in the schools. The present article will explore the reasons boys are involved in such frequent problems in school, and will make recommendations for persons working with elementary school aged boys.",

Its activity has hitherto been derived from a number of separate instincts and erotogenic zones, which, independently of one another, have pursued a certain sort of pleasure as their sole sexual aim. Now, however, a new sexual aim appears, and all the component instincts combine to attain it, while the erotogenic zones become subordinated to the primacy of the genital zone. 1 Since the new sexual aim assigns very different functions to the two sexes, their sexual development now diverges greatly. That of males is the more straightforward and the more understandable, while that of females actually enters upon a kind of involution. A normal sexual life is only assured by an exact 18convergence of the affectionate current and the sensual current both being directed towards the sexual object and sexual aim.

      "title": "“Women” as The Subject of Feminism",
      "abstract": "For the most part, feminist theory has assumed that there is some existing identity, understood through the category of women, who not only initiates feminist interests and goals within discourse, but constitutes the subject for whom political representation is pursued. There is a great deal of material that not only questions the viability of \"the subject\" as the ultimate candidate for representation or, indeed, liberation, but there is very little agreement after all on what it is that constitutes, or ought to constitute, the category of women. Although the unproblematic unity of \"women\" is often invoked to construct a solidarity of identity, a split is introduced in the feminist subject by the distinction between sex and gender. The presumption of a binary gender system implicitly retains the belief in a mimetic relation of gender to sex whereby gender mirrors sex or is otherwise restricted by it.",

Yet even here, as we shall see, there are signs of change and convergence. As friendship and love have become “feminized”-that is, as the model of appropriate behavior has come to resemble what we labeled as traditionally “feminine” models of intimacy-sexuality has become increasingly “masculinized.” The “masculinization of sex”-including the pursuit of pleasure for its own sake, the increased attention to orgasm, the multiplication of sexual partners, the universal interest in sexual experimentation, and the separation of sexual behavior from love-is partly a result of the technological transformation of sexuality (from birth control to the Internet) and partly the result of the sexual revolution’s promise of greater sexual freedom with fewer emotional and physical consequences.",

How this sense is linked to the perception of one’s own masculine or feminine body remains unclear. Here, in a series of three behavioral experiments conducted on a large group of healthy volunteers (N=140), we show that a perceptual illusion of having the opposite-sex body was associated with a shift toward more balanced identification with both genders and less gender-stereotypical beliefs about one’s own personality characteristics, as indicated by subjective reports and implicit behavioral measures. These findings demonstrate that the ongoing perception of one’s own body affects the sense of one’s own gender in a dynamic, robust, and automatic manner.",

Besides, this category is enforced by language and therefore can not be correlated to culture since speakers cannot freely alter it without modifying other elements in the system (agreement, neutralizations, etc.). Nevertheless, the multiple forms of identification to be found in languages (sex, status, age, etc.) are to be related to culture since they do not strictly depend on linguistic factors and can therefore be modified.

Yet, mainly in the case of nouns denoting trades and professions, posts, representatives of intellectual and political movements and relations between individuals the feminine opposites are missing. This gap in the language is bridged by the respective masculine plus a secondary gender identifier or by this masculine plus a lexical supplement and secondary gender identifiers. Yet, the above mentioned linguistic means that are used for denoting male and female individuals cannot be employed indiscriminately or regardless of tho context. Certain sentence structures, too, rule out the use of certain means of the language for denoting gender explicitely.",

In some species, females choose male traits that indicate genetic quality or confer benefits. Thus, male traits and female preferences are assumed to originate at the same time and to coevolve. In contrast, sensory exploitation occurs when males take advantage of females’ preexisting sensory biases. We show in Drosophila sensory exploitation of males by other males through the use of a pheromone to gain sexual advantage. Notably, sensory exploitation leads to male sensory adaptation. These findings provide a mechanism for the evolutionary origins of a pheromone and are a previously unidentified example of sensory exploitation between males.",

Outside of the postpartum period, feeling more satisfied with one's body is linked with feeling more sexually and relationally satisfied, with some cross-sectional evidence that sexual satisfaction mediates these associations. This dyadic daily experience study examined how new parents' daily satisfaction with their own and their partner's bodies relates to their own sexual satisfaction, and in turn, their own and their partner's relationship satisfaction during a vulnerable time in their sexual and romantic relationship-3- to 4-months postpartum. First-time parent couples (N = 240) completed 21 daily surveys. On days when birthing parents reported greater satisfaction than usual with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, higher relationship satisfaction. On days when non-birthing parents reported greater satisfaction with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, both parents reported higher relationship satisfaction. Evidence of bidirectionality was also observed such that relationship satisfaction mediated links between body satisfaction and sexual satisfaction. Findings support that daily body satisfaction is important for both sexual and relationship satisfaction among postpartum couples.",

While homosexuality and other forms of nonprocreative sex have long been viewed as deviant, they have not always been outlawed. As sexual behaviors became increasingly linked to people's identity, new measures were introduced to restrict so-called deviant sexual expression. This connection between sexual behavior and identity gave rise to homophobia as well as to tightening restrictions on sexualities, particularly female sexualities. Homophobia takes many forms, and beginning in the 1950s in the United States, public policies were created granting explicit permission to fire federal employees on grounds of “sexual perversion.” As US society has shifted its views about sexuality and normative sexual practices, research on sex and sexualities has evolved. Problems, however, continue to exist in the areas of sexualities, most notably for those with female, non-gender-conforming, adolescent, and/or black and brown bodies.",

Despite the fact that coming out is viewed by the literature as one of many necessary developmental steps in sexual identity formation and self-acceptance, coming out can be viewed as a unique stage in this developmental continuum. Coming out is an acknowledgment of one's orientation to another person. Thus, coming out is more than an intrapsychic process; it influences interpersonal relationships as well. A whole host of factors, including identity confusion, low self-esteem, depression, alienation, withdrawal, substance abuse, and indulgence in self-destructive behavior, may result if the adolescent has little or no support in this critical developmental stage process. Involvement in the gay community or other types of homosexual peer groups offers a unique sense of support that is especially needed during the coming out period.",

      "title": "Unintended Consequences of the Feminist Sex/gender Distinction",
      "abstract": "[1] The average person does not distinguish between and and uses the two terms interchangeably. The same can be said of a significant number of social scientists. For instance, an unsystematic review of one recent of Sociological Forum and several recent issues of American Journal of Sociology produced five examples of this conflation of sex and (Bonilla-Silva et al., 562; Huffman and Cohen, 912; Lincoln and Allen, 621; Petersen and Saporta, 855; Rutherford, 593). This treatment of and as synonymous dismisses, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the considerable conceptual work of scholars over the last thirty years and harks back to essentialist as well as determinist notions of sex, conflating, among other things, social roles, psychological dispositions, power differences, norms of grooming and comportment, sexual object choice and reproductive anatomy. Such an understanding thus collapses important intellectual and experiential distinctions; in so doing, it also fails to provide conceptual categories for the experiences of women and men whose sex, gender, and/or sexuality do not align in socially normative ways. The instantiation of the conceptual separation of from sex was an effort to give language to some of these distinctions, and the subsequent rigorous critical assessment of the term over the intervening decades has further refined them. [2] Although it is impossible to make accurate generalizations about the work of all scholars, the prevailing trends can be usefully defined and studied. Here I am addressing the vast body of scholarship that continues to rely, either implicitly or explicitly, on the conceptual distinction between sex and gender. While my analysis draws predominantly--though not exclusively--on social scientific scholarship, the trends I will outline apply equally to humanistic scholarship that is organized conceptually by the sex/gender distinction. [3] The last several decades have been defined by active scholarly critique and development of the concept of gender; however, most scholars have remained conspicuously silent on the subject of sex. The conceptual shift from a single essentialist category of to a binary distinction between and did not double the number of concepts receiving scholarly attention. In effect, replaced as the salient category in gender Ann Fausto-Sterling describes this refocusing of scholarship when she writes that feminists did not question the realm of physical sex; it was the psychological and cultural meanings of these differences--gender--that was at issue (Fausto-Sterling, 3). Gatens offers Chodorow and Dinnerstein as early and paradigmatic examples of what she refers to as the favoring of the concept of over sex (Gatens, 4); Rubin is another important example. (Note that now the most common name for the discipline, Gender Studies, even reveals this shift in focus). In response to this striking silence on the subject of sex amid the flood of scholarship on gender, I argue scholars must bring sex into our collective discourse. It is important to emphasize that I am not only advocating for more analysis of the masculine or the feminine body, or the physical dimensions of masculinity and femininity. I am specifically arguing for a sociological analysis of male and female bodies. [4] A small number of scholars have argued that sex is socially constructed. Notable examples are Kessler and McKenna, Laqueur, Butler, Martin (1991) and Fausto-Sterling. Their specific contributions as well as the unique limitations of each of their approaches are discussed in the section titled Bringing the 'Sex' Back In. What is important to note here is that these are the exceptions that prove the rule that sex itself is typically absent from anti-essentialist scholarship. [5] One reason sex itself has been markedly absent from scholarship has to do with the meaning assigned to sex under the feminist sex/gender dichotomy. …",

Older intersexed people are living with the consequences of how potentially all such sexual rights have been violated, perhaps especially 'the right to equality and non-discrimination' and 'the right to autonomy and bodily integrity'. To speak of intersex ageing concerns is very much a product of recent developments in medicine. With technical advances in medicine in the latter half of the 20th century, various intersexualizing diagnoses became more common. Many of this population have histories of non-consensual medical interventions and are living with the ongoing effects, physically and emotionally, of those interventions. Many of the people appearing in Intersexion describe the shame of hiding their differences and being made to lie about 'vacationing' when they were in hospital for surgeries.",

Efectuado con personas de 20 a 30 años donde se refleja que la percepción de no inclusión es más detectada para con los otros que para con los respondientes. Más de la mitad declara a la inclusión como integración al empleo, derechos, igualdad y aceptación sin incluir en la declaración algún concepto de género. Más de 60% de respondientes ha sido testigo de no inclusión en otros por imagen o apariencia, 59% por el físico de la persona y 55.5% por genero u orientación de género. Casi una cuarta parte de los respondientes ha sufrido por ser discriminada por su apariencia o imagen, por su físico o por ser mujer. Existe una diferencia estadísticamente significativa entre las percepciones en otro y la vivencia propia de eventos de no inclusión destacando la primera (la percepción en el otro) y por tanto una declaración implícita y no explicita de la existencia de no inclusión en el entorno de la investigación.",

It blurs the domains of psychiatry and law. The age of sexual consent is 14 in much of Europe. An example of the new mentally disordered would be a 19 year old with a consenting 14 year old.

      "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the role of stress in pregnancy and its consequences is important, particularly given documented associations between maternal stress and preterm birth and other pathological outcomes. Physical and psychological stressors can elicit the same biological responses, known as biological strain. Chronic stressors, like poverty and racism (race-based discriminatory treatment), may create a legacy or trajectory of biological strain that no amount of coping can relieve in the absence of larger-scale socio-behavioral or societal changes. An integrative approach that takes into consideration simultaneously social and biological determinants of stress may provide the best insights into the risk of preterm birth. The most successful computational approaches and the most predictive machine-learning models are likely to be those that combine information about the stressors and the biological strain (for example, as measured by different omics) experienced during pregnancy.",

Unlike other sports however, clothing for performance rather than fashion or cultural consumption remains under-researched. With increasing research on the gendered and sexualized nature of surfing alongside an increasing emphasis on female surfing as athletic performance, a paradox seems apparent. In warm-water competition, women deal with tensions associated with appearance, sponsorship driven by sexual objectification and functional surfwear that increases exposed body surface – while men's clothing epitomizes comfort, protection and ultimately a reduction in exposed body surface. Under the guise of athletic performance and celebrating female gains in the sport, a patriarchal thread seems to tie up a particular sex, gender and sexuality order that is neither new nor productive for high performance or full participation.",

      "title": "Family factors associated with conduct disorders in Children and Adolescents.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Conduct disorder is a disorder initially diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and\r\nrefers to a persistent pattern of antisocial behavior in which the individual repeatedly\r\nbreaks social rules and carries out aggressive acts that upset other people. Antisocial\r\nbehavior is a common problem in the course of development of children. Although\r\nconduct disorder has been widely studied, it still consumes much of the resources of\r\nmental health, juvenile justice and the special education system. DSM-IV mentions\r\nconduct disorder as one of the most frequently diagnosed conditions in outpatient and\r\ninpatient mental health facilities for children 1 DSM- IV specifies for conduct disorder,\r\ncriteria which includes symptoms from the following areas: aggression against people\r\nor animals, property destruction, lying or theft and serious rule violation. It defines\r\nconduct disorder as a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic\r\nrights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated 2. About a\r\nthird of those affected have antisocial personality disorder in adult life and a further\r\nthird experience other personality, psychiatric and psychosocial problems. The\r\nprevalence of conduct disorders varies from 6-20% in studies across different cultures\r\nand settings 3, 4. In the evolution of conduct disorders different risk factors are\r\nimplicated which includes “child biological factors,” “child functional factors,” and\r\n“psychosocial factors” 5. Even though the number of studies discussing the evolution of\r\nconduct disorders and factors associated with it are numerous, there is a lack of\r\ninformation on risk factors associated with conduct disorder in our Indian population.\r\nIn this study we aim to delineate the family factors like parenting style, parental\r\nseparation, parental psychopathology, family type and family functioning associated\r\nwith conduct disorders.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES : \r\nTo study the family factors associated with conduct disorder in a clinic-based\r\npopulation.\r\nTo study the family factors in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct\r\ndisorder, in comparison with a group of children without conduct disorder, but with\r\nother psychiatric disorders.\r\nThe following null hypothesis was postulated:\r\nThere is no significant difference between children and adolescents with conduct\r\ndisorder and those without conduct disorder, with respect to family factors.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS : The participants were recruited from the outpatient department of the Child and\r\nAdolescent Psychiatry Unit, Department of Psychiatry, Christian Medical College. This\r\nis a tertiary care centre, providing services to children and adolescents with various\r\nmental health needs, from different parts of the country and neighboring regions. The\r\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry unit of the Department has two divisions, one for\r\nchildren with emotional as well as behavioral disorders and the other one for children\r\nwith developmental disorders. The multidisciplinary treating team makes the clinical\r\ndiagnosis based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic system.\r\n Inclusion criteria:\r\n1. Children and adolescents between 5 - 18yrs.\r\n2. Diagnosed to have conduct disorder based on the ICD-10 clinical diagnostic criteria\r\nat initial presentation.\r\n3. Conduct disorder with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders\r\n4. Conversant in English, Tamil or Hindi.\r\n\r\nRESULTS : The acceptability of the study data for a parametric analysis was initially assessed and\r\nfound to be favourable as depicted in Table 1.\r\n164 children and adolescents were enrolled for the study between January 2010 and\r\nOctober 2010. As diagnostic data was missing for 5 participants, only 159 participants\r\nwere considered for further analysis. Table 2 shows the participant characteristics of the total sample. The sample consisted\r\nof children and adolescents between the ages of 5 to 18 years with a mean age of 11.61\r\nyears (SD 3.5). Approximately three fourth of the participants were male (74.2%). The\r\nmajority had completed at least a primary or high school education (91.2%).\r\nParticipants were predominantly Hindus and hailed from a upper middle socioeconomic\r\nbackground. There was a slightly larger representation from urban areas (56.6%). The\r\nmajority was from Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (79.3 %), therefore spoke Tamil and\r\nBengali respectively. All the participants included whose mother tongue was Bengali,\r\nwere also conversant in Hindi.\r\nThere were 63 participants with conduct disorder which accounted for 30.6% of the\r\ntotal disorders seen. Among children with conduct disorder, 33.3% had conduct\r\ndisorder in the family context, 15.9% had socialized conduct disorder and oppositional\r\ndefiant disorder was seen in 50.85%.The majority (40%) of other diagnosis present in\r\nthe total sample included mild mental retardation and ADHD. ‘Other’ disorders\r\nincluded nonspecific behaviour problems and enuresis.\r\nCONCLUSION : In conclusion, while this study failed to find a significant association of family factors\r\nwith conduct disorder when a multivariate analysis was done, male gender and more\r\nnumber of comorbidities had a significant association with conduct disorder.",

      "title": "Editorial: Wandering",
      "abstract": "The papers in this practice development section address a complex and confusing issue – that of wandering. There are many debates about wandering – perhaps most importantly the question of what wandering is. The term itself is an ambiguous one – wandering may be defined in many different ways. Constant and extensive walking may be seen as wandering by some, while others may see it even in comparatively infrequent and limited moving around. Here, the context seems to be important – extensive moving around could be seen as admirable and energetic, and there are many circumstances in which it is socially approved, for example walking clubs or exercise groups. This degree of activity, however, can also be defined as wandering if it is outside these social frameworks, and the context and circumstances do not support or approve it. Conversely, staying still can be seen as an indication of lethargy or laziness, or as a sign of discomfort or disability. From these viewpoints then, a lack of activity can be seen as a problem in some contexts, and only socially approved in contexts where activity is not desirable. The ambiguity of the term ‘wandering’, then, seems to be connected to the context in which it happens, rather than just the activity itself, and this is also where ideas about wandering as a problem arise. If an environment is crowded and complicated, for example, even limited movement may cause problems, as people encounter obstacles and difficulties. Even large spaces may cause problems, as people can lose direction and get lost. Key to this ‘problematizing’ of wandering is the relationship between the carer and the person who is seen as wandering. If the carer feels or has responsibility for safety and well-being, or maintenance of the environment, or the safety and well-being of others, then wandering presents a number of challenges, particularly how to reach a balance between supporting activity and minimizing risk. If resources and knowledge are limited, it is easy to see how this can move towards restrictive practice, trying to stop people moving around at all. As the papers in this practice development section show, trying to prevent wandering can have many untoward consequences, as people resent restrictions and try to counter them. In these situations, struggling against restrictions may lead to injuries and accidents. If there is no struggle, and people passively accept restrictions, then there may be consequences of inactivity, of joint and muscle weakness, and boredom and under-stimulation. The papers point to the advantages of developing a constructive practice strategy response to wandering. The first step towards this, however, is a critical reflection on what we mean when we use the term ‘wandering’. Thinking about this means that we must challenge some of our assumptions and stereotypes of older people and their behaviour. This means thinking about whether we are using the term as a reflection of our own concerns, rather than the behaviour of others, as discussed above. What it also suggests, however, is that we think about our ideas of older people and people with dementia. If we see wandering as pathological, perhaps a manifestation of the ageing process or the development of dementia, then we may not think clearly about wandering, but simply see it as an inevitable problem that needs to be solved. These assumptions are based on our ideas of ageing and dementia, and so need to be challenged, and we need to consider that the activity we see is simply a reflection of what people like to do. Wandering, then, can act as a spur to some useful thinking. This can involve thinking about the preferences and lifestyles of people in later life, the assumptions we have about them, and the ways in which our roles and responsibilities shape our practice. Moreover, this critical reflection can help us to go beyond our assumptions to look at the knowledge we have. This may also involve thinking about the knowledge that we need, and also how we may best use knowledge to inform our practice. As the papers in this practice development section show, then, the topic of wandering raises questions about our practice and activities, but also about our assumptions and knowledge, and how these may develop.",

      "abstract": "The issue of studying social health in the context of the older generation involvement in social relations is relevant. We analyze numerous foreign studies on the correlation of social relations involvement, physical and mental health. Foreign studies on mortality in many industrialized countries consistently show that people with the least involvement in social ties are more likely to die than those who are more involved. Social connections affect health through behavioral, psychosocial and physiological mechanisms. Behavioral mechanisms are revealed through involvement in formal (for example, religious organizations) and informal (for example, friends and relatives) social ties. A link has been established with more positive health behaviors over a ten-year period. Psychosocial mechanisms are manifested through social support that promotes mental and physical health. Physiological mechanisms act through psychosomatic manifestations. Studies show that conflicted relationships or lack of social support can exacerbate the symptoms of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The concept of “social health” as one of the possible dimensions of social support is practically not represented in academic publications. The foreign concept of social health has not acquired the status of an academic scientific theory to date. This requires further research, including a systematic analysis of the literature, the development of clear definitions and the operationalization of key constructs.",

Typically, the spouse, the in-laws, or even the woman's own parents will exert pressure to have her do this. Abortions are often performed because of an unwanted pregnancy. Yet, female foeticide is an even greater evil than the age-old practise of murdering an undesired kid, even before it is born. India, like many other cultures, is too patriarchal. All social strata adhere to a predetermined hierarchy. It's not like any other culture's fanatical fixation on the male sex. Men have been held in high esteem as the essential link in preserving the family name from ancient times. Unless she achieves her lifetime objective of becoming a breeding machine that produces male children according to the demands of the family, a girl is subjected to repeated pregnancies and (or) abortions.",

      "abstract": "Medieval persons showed nuanced awareness of human lifespan development. The familiar 'ages of man' texts generally followed one of three conceptual systems: the biologists' theory of three ages (youth, maturity, and old age); the physiologists' theory of four ages (childhood, youth, maturity, and old age), corresponding to the four humours, seasons, and elements; and the astrologers' theory of seven ages (infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth, maturity, old age, decrepitude) following the Ptolemaic structure of the universe. By the later Middle Ages a stable set of terms divided childhood into seven-year segments: infantia (infancy), pueritia (childhood), and adolescentia (adolescence). These demarcations were based primarily upon age but also considered the social, emotional, and mental development of the individual. Prior to the age of seven or infantia, an infant girl was not considered to be a fully rational and responsible agent. The transition to pueritia was marked by growing personal awareness and social accountability, and the move into adolescentia was marked by the onset of menarche and secondary sexual characteristics. At adolescentia, regarded as twelve for girls and fourteen for boys, young people could marry according to canon law or could break a marriage contract arranged in their childhood by paying a fine equivalent to the value of the marriage. Although remaining unmarried was a possibility, the life options available to most girls were limited to marriage, religious vocation, or some form of domestic employment or household management. The social ideal, of course, was for young medieval girls to marry and have children, for the normative course of secular life led a girl directly from her father’s house as a child and daughter to her husband’s house as a wife and mother.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung zeigen die gesamte Vielfalt sexueller Fantasien und sexuellen Verhaltens ebenso wie ihre nichtbetroffenen Peers. Dennoch finden sich auch einige Besonderheiten in sexuellem Erleben und Verhalten bei Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung, die größtenteils auf die störungsspezifischen Symptome zurückzuführen sind. Hierzu zählen eine höhere Diversität bezüglich der eigenen sexuellen Orientierung sowie des eigenen Geschlechtsrollenverständnisses, aber auch Probleme im Hinblick auf das Eingehen von festen Partnerschaften oder im Hinblick auf die eigene sexuelle Funktionsfähigkeit. Darüber hinaus finden sich bei manchen Personen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung (insbesondere bei Männern) Hinweise auf das Vorliegen hypersexueller Verhaltensweisen sowie paraphiler sexueller Fantasien und Verhaltensweisen. Bisher existieren keine empirischen Befunde, die nahelegen, dass eine Autismus-Spektrum-Störung einen Risikofaktor für allgemeine oder sexuelle Straffälligkeit darstellt. Basierend auf Fallstudien wurden jedoch einige Erklärungsansätze publiziert, die beschreiben, wie in einigen wenigen Fällen die autismusspezifische Symptomatik mit zu der Begehung einer Straftat beigetragen haben könnte, was auch bei der Schuldfähigkeitsbegutachtung Berücksichtigung finden könnte. Hierzu zählen eine fehlende Opferempathie, das Vorliegen kognitiver Verzerrungen oder defizitäre Kommunikations- und Interaktionsfertigkeiten. Straftäter mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-Störung sollten individuell auf sie zugeschnittenen psycho- und pharmakotherapeutischen Interventionen zugeführt werden, um eine erneute Straffälligkeit im besten Falle zu verhindern.",

      "title": "EVOLVING MASCULINITY: A STUDY OF BODY POSITIVITY IN MEN",
      "abstract": "If we are to understand why it is so rare and what the future holds, the topic of body positivity in males has evolved into a complex one that requires discussion. Men frequently encounter irrational expectations that result in body dissatisfaction and a low sense of self- worth in todays society, when media representations of the ideal male form and gender stereotypes predominate. The medias depiction of the ideal male body, which is characterized by muscular proportions and low body fat, is a major reason man are not positive about their bodies. These restrictive rules put pressure on men to conform, which can cause body dissatisfaction and a decrease in self- esteem. Furthermore, the traditional gender roles of men and women indicate the idea that men should be portrayed as strong, stoic, and emotionally controlled, which discourages open conversations about body image issues and the need for assistance. The psychological and mental toll it takes on a person can cause various issues in men, both physically and mentally. It may be caused by constant pressure to meet these standards. Feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction can also be a contributing factor. It can lead to chronic problems in life. The most important part of maintaining a healthy state of mind is managing these body image concerns. In men, theres a lot of ways to support positive body image. Through education and awareness programs, these programs challenge harmful beauty norms and promote positive body image. Resources and workshops to help men reject outdated ideas and accepting body positivity need to be provided by schools, organizations, and communities. Its critical that we dismantle obstacles when it comes to mens body image. The secret to building an environment where guys can talk about their issues and receive assistance without fear of judgment is to have open dialogues about topics like how they feel about their bodies and mental health. Social media can also be a useful tool for promoting campaigns that celebrate the diversity of peoples bodies and for sharing fascinating tales that people can relate to.",

      "title": "Factors that determine whether grazing animals will accept supplements.",
      "abstract": "When large groups of grazing livestock which appear, superficially, to come from similar genetic and environmental backgrounds are offered a food supplement, some may not consume it, while others exhibit a wide range of intakes. Such variability in acceptance of supplements creates many practical problems. An animal usually exhibits neophobia when confronted by a novel food or new surroundings. The baseline level of neophobia is probably innately determined but is modifiied by an animal’s experiences. Continued exposure, particularly with others that eat that supplement (mothers, other adults or conspecifics) increases the naive animal’s motivation to sample and thereby learn about the supplement. In this way, nutritional wisdom gained by individuals in herds or flocks may be passed from one generation to the next. Once ingested, a supplement may elicit positive or negative metabolic stimuli that are collated by the central nervous system (CNS) thereby generating conditioned associations between characteristics of the supplement, e.g. flavours or other cues, and its post-ingestive effects on the CNS. Positive post-ingestive effects and suitable food cues generate a high ‘hedonic rating’ for that food in the animal. This rating is subject to modification whenever the supplement is ingested, as the animal’s requirements change in line with its changing physiological state, and as other alternative foods in the pasture become more or less available or nutritious. Non-acceptance of supplements by individual animals is apparently partly genetically determined by innate baseline neophobia and avoidance of certain food cues. Non-acceptance or lower intakes of a previously ingested supplement may result from alterations in the animal’s own energy or nutrient requirements with changing physiological state, or the presence of newly available foods that can be selected by the animal to give an alternative diet which better optimises the ‘costbenefit’ relationship. Reductions in supplement intake may also be due to food aversions formed via nonspecific negative stimuli that inadvertently become associated with food ingestion (e.g. created by disease),",

They assert that this behaviour, which they label the early genital phase, arises with increasing specificity in body awareness and concomitant increasing self-definition and is not specifically linked to oedipal ideation. They hypothesise that severe early disturbances in body image formation such as resulting from illness and injury and/or early disturbances in object relatedness, particularly loss, will cause intense and observable gender-differentiated disturbances with important and lasting consequences. Their observations indeed provide us with a rich store of surprisingly highly differentiated sexual and gender-related responses of boys and girls during the crucial second half of the second year of life.",

      "title": "Personal identity",
      "abstract": "The ‘problem of personal identity’ as it is usually construed in philosophy is a special case of more general questions about the identity of objects over time. There are a variety of puzzles about how a single object can persist through change, and these puzzles run especially deep in the case of persons, due to their complexity and the number of dimensions along which they can alter. More concretely, those working on the problem of personal identity investigate the question of what makes a woman of 50 the same person as the girl she was at 15, despite the fact that she may resemble that girl in very few respects. This question is a metaphysical question about numerical identity, aimed at defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for the literal persistence of one and the same entity through time. It is thus distinguished from epistemological questions which ask what evidence we use to make judgements of personal identity, and also from psychological or sociological questions which ask about identity in the sense of the stability of a unique personality or character. Historically there have been three main answers to the problem of personal identity. One defines identity in terms of the continuation of a single immaterial substance or soul; one in terms of psychological continuity; and one in terms of biological continuity. All of these views have had their adherents, but it is now widely accepted that sameness-of-soul views have too many difficulties to provide a truly tenable account of personal identity, and most recent discussions of personal identity focus on the relative merits of psychological and biological accounts. For much of the latter half of the twentieth century psychological accounts represented by far the predominant approach to questions of personal identity. These views, inspired by John Locke’s claim that personal identity should be defined in terms of sameness of consciousness rather than sameness of substance, hold that a person at time t2 is the same as a person at earlier time t1 just in case there is an overlapping chain of psychological connections (memories, beliefs, desires, etc.) between the person at t2 and the person at t1. They have a great deal of intuitive appeal, capturing the widely held sense that if biological and psychological continuity were to diverge, the person would go where the psychological life goes, but they have also been subject to some important objections. Many of these are related to the fact that psychological continuity does not have the same logical form as identity. For instance, a person existing now could in principle be psychologically continuous with two people in the future, but cannot be identical to both of them since they are not identical to each other. Biological accounts of identity have recently re-emerged with new vigour, mounting a serious challenge to the dominance of psychological accounts. Defenders of the biological approach say that we are, most fundamentally, human animals who persist as long as a single human organism does. The biological approach allows that psychological continuity may be of tremendous importance to us, and that we may ‘identify’ with our psychological states, but insists this continuity is no part of what determines our literal persistence as single entities. Biological theorists point out that if we think of persons as entities distinct from human animals we will be left with a number of awkward questions about the relation between persons and animals, making psychological continuity theories deeply implausible. In response, defenders of the psychological approach have argued that biological accounts suffer from many of the same deficits with which they charge psychological theories. Also, constitution theorists have offered a new kind of psychological account that avoids the problems traditional psychological theorists face in explaining the relation of persons to human animals. The debate between these psychological and biological approaches to identity is ongoing. In addition, several new kinds of account of personal identity have been defended, including minimalist views that place identity in the continuation of rudimentary psychological capacities and narrative views that see persons as narrative in form and define the unity of a person’s life as a narrative unity. Recently, the problem of personal identity has also played an important role in bioethical debates. This has led to a more general investigation of the relation between metaphysical questions of personal identity and practical judgements.",

Family sex communication has been studied with a limited range of adolescent sexual behaviors but not sexual fantasy or desire. Two measures of family sex communication were compared and examined in relation to measures of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, and behavior among a sample of 522 females and males in their late adolescence. An expanded range of sexual behaviors was assessed. Family sex communication was not associated with level of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, or most sexual behaviors. Causal inferences cannot be made, but parents might consider talking openly with their children about sexual matters without fearing that such communication will ignite their sexual desire or prompt sexual behavior.

      "abstract": "When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them – such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock – can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements – such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or wellbeing of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‐choice and pro‐life movements, and of those advocating for and against same‐sex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly, other motivational factors – such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure – may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

      "title": "Deception in 3-year-olds.",
      "abstract": "Children's ability to deceive was examined in order to determine whether they are able to hide their emotional expression intentionally. Three-year-oids were instructed not to peek at a toy while the experimenter left the room. When asked, the great majority either denied that they peeked or would not answer the question. Facial and bodily activity did not differentiate the deceivers from the truth tellers. Boys were more likely than girls to admit their transgression. These results indicate that very young children have begun to learn how to mask their emotional expressions and support the role of socialization in this process. Deception is a frequent activity in the life of individuals. It may take the simple form of agreeing with someone with whose opinion, in fact, we do not agree (e.g., saying we like the color of a tie when we do not) or other forms such as lying about a serious transgression. Deception can be directed toward the self as well, as in the case where we deny that we have a certain feeling when, in fact, we do feel this way (Lewis, in press). Moreover, cultures may have display rules that encourage masking negative emotion (Ekman, Friesen, & Ellsworth, 1972; Izard, 1977). Deception can be observed in all age groups, but the questions of how old a child must be in order to be able to deceive and how well a child can succeed in the deception are largely unexplored.",

      "title": "Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence, and Mental Health Outcomes: Causal Inference with Ambiguous Exposures",
      "abstract": "Social exposures and their impact on mental health has proven hard to capture, partly owing to the complex and multifaceted nature of the social reality. Sexual harassment and sexual violence (SHV) are no exceptions. SHV can be conceptualized as a continuum of negative sexual experiences whose severity varies depending on multiple determinants (type of SHV, frequency, power relations, etc.). Further, exposure to SHV may be conceptualized either as discrete exposures (i.e., experiences of specific SHV events) or as exposure to a sexually hostile environment, often represented by a latent variable reflected by patters of SHV events. With any of these conceptualizations, SHV constitutes a broad construct containing many kinds of negative experiences. The ambiguity of SHV pose a challenge when attempting to determine its mental health consequences, as different forms of SHV may vary in terms of their mental health impact. In this article we use the potential outcomes framework to discuss the conceptualization of SHV in relation to mental health outcomes, focusing on the consistency condition. We discuss limitations and possible interpretations of estimates of the causal effect of SHV on mental health, both when SHV are conceptualized as discrete exposures and when conceptualized as one or several latent variables. We present the recently developed multiple versions of treatment theory and show how it can provide a formal interpretation of causal estimates under ambiguous exposures. Lastly, we provide suggestions on how the increase the clarity and interpretability of estimates of the effects of SHV on mental health, by increasing the precision of the causal questions and the use of more specific definitions of SHV exposures.",

These children show extreme and enduring forms of gender nonconforming/gender variant behaviours, preferences, and interests because they do not identify with their birthassigned gender. Because of the incongruence between their assigned gender and experienced gender, these children may experience clinically significant distress and are consequently often in need of clinical attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).",

      "title": "Psychology feminine holiness",
      "abstract": "Feminine holiness is a subject as complex as it is interesting–not least because of the very definition of the term–, in many occasions extraordinary and many others bitter, which has sparked interest throughout history, especially after the progress made on modernity. Objective The main objective is less to show whether there is a psychiatric, infectious, neurological or any other form of pathological disorder linked to the behaviour of female saints, rather to evaluate all the psychological and social aspects that result in holiness as a mental state being largely a female attribute. Material and methods For this, we have tested from birth to death, in what is possible, the lives of sixty religious women, through biographies and autobiographies since they were servants, pious or holy according to ecclesiastical terminology. This set was unavoidable to select twelve cases, which are set out exhaustively in this study. Results and discussion Limiting ourselves to a purely psychiatric view, we can show the presence of psychopathology associated with exceptional states of consciousness, as would be ecstatic and mystical experience itself, present in most cases. We also found common psychological profiles, out of the sixty biographies and autobiographies of religious women analyzed: e.g. pain is used as a means of atonement and a way of removing the guilt of sin. We rule out major psychiatric disorders in the Santas we have analyzed. The behaviors they presented, even sometimes excessive, cannot be included in any of the current major psychiatric disorders. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Sexual Responses Are Facilitated by High-Order Contextual Cues in Females but Not in Males",
      "abstract": "Sexual responses are thought to be controlled by a brain module called the sexual module. Sexual strategies of males and females vary to a great extent, and sexual responses of males and females may be affected by their sexual strategies. However, the current view of the sexual module is that of a unisex module. This might be questionable since brain modules are defined as evolved cognitive mechanisms to solve adaptive problems which are different for males and females. We hypothesize that the sexual module responds differently in the presence of complex (high-order) contextual cues that are related to gender-dimorphic sexual strategies in males and females. We conducted a priming experiment in which stimuli related to sexual strategies were disentangled from their sexual meaning. Nonsexual priming pictures related to either economic resources or social interactions preceded a sexual-target picture in order to test whether the primes were able to modulate the subjective sexual response to the sexual target. In a control condition, priming pictures without relation to mating preferences but with similar emotional impact were presented. In males, sexual responses were similar in the experimental and control conditions. In females, however, primes related to economic resources or social interactions modulated sexual arousal significantly more than the control primes. Our findings suggest that brain modules dedicated to process the experimental primes were functionally connected with the sexual module in females more than in males, making females’ sexual responses more prone to the impact of high-order cultural cues than males’ sexual responses. A gender-dimorphic connectivity of the sexual module may be the way in which gender-dimorphic sexual strategies are implemented in the human mind.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined whether sex differences in emotion are related to the social context and addressed differences between global, retrospective, and on-line, momentary self-descriptions of emotional experience and expression. Participants provided global, retrospective descriptions of their emotional characteristics at an initial session, and then provided momentary emotion ratings as well as details about the social context in which they experienced their emotions over a one-week period. We predicted and found that sex-related differences in emotion in global self-descriptions, but not in the averaged momentary ratings of emotion. Furthermore, only sex of the interaction partner elicited sex differences in emotionality; participants experienced and expressed more emotion when in opposite-sex dyads. Although most of the other context variables were themselves associated with emotional experience or expression, suggesting that they were emotionally evocative, none emerged as elicitors of sex differences in emotional experience; felt intimacy in the interaction was associated with sex differences in ratings of emotional expression. Together, the findings present certain caveats to the widely held belief that women are the ''more emotional'' sex.",

      "abstract": "Sex determination in mammals is different, as a single bipotential gonad can develop either into a testes or an ovary. If this genetic process which is largely complex gets disrupted during development of a human being it can lead to disorders of sex development. There are two separate processes by which sex development takes place namely i) sex determination whereby the bipotential gonad forms either a testes or ovaries and sex differentiation of internal and external genitalia along with extragonadal tissues like the brain. DSD’s may occur due to different genetic lesion pathways. In this review we have concentrated in details of various genetic pathways causing DSD’s and signal transduction pathways by which various manifestations of gonadal forms like gonadal dysgenesis to ovotestis and genital forms from mild hypospadias or clitoromegaly to ambiguous genitalia phenotype may result. Here we do not touch on sex differentiation of internal genitalia and external genitalia. Keywords: DSD’s; Genetics; Signal Transduction System; Ambiguous Genitalia; Gonadal Dysgenesis; Ovotestis; SRY related high mobility group box (Sox) transcription factors have emerged in the animal kingdom to help cells maintain stemness, commit to a specific lineage, proliferate or die. Encoded by 20 genes in humans and mice they show a highly conserved high-mobility group boxdomain, which was originally identified in SRY, the sex determining region on the Y chromosome. This has derived from a high mobility group domain characterized of chromatin associated proteins. HMG (high mobility group) non histone chromosomal proteins include the AT hook, HMGN, and HMG domain families . Members of the Sox SRY (Sex determining region on the Y chromosome) related HMG box family of chromatin remodelling factors play important development roles. SRY plays a key role in mammalian sex determination as determined by the fact that 15% of all XY sex reversal individuals carry mutations in SRY.",

      "title": "[Sexual differentiation of the human brain].",
      "abstract": "Normal human development requires the compatibility between genetic sex (sex chromosomes), sex of gonades (tests or ovaries), genitalia (external and internal sex organs), somatic features (body characteristics) and psychic sex. The psychic sex, called frequently gender, consist of gender identity (self-estimation), gender role (objective estimation) and sexual orientation (hetero- or homosexual). It was believed that the psychic gender depends only on socio-environmental influences such as rearing, learning and individual choice. Although, the process of sexual differentiation of human brain is not completely elucidated, it has became recently evident that endogenous hormones more then socio-environmental factors influence gender differences. Experimental studies on animals revealed that transient action of sex steroids during perinatal period of life is crucial for the dymorphism of sexual behavior (male or female) in adulthood. It seems, that also in the human male neonates testosterone produced by testes perinatally takes the main role in the irreversible masculinization of the brain i.e. creation of the differences vs. female brain. The evaluation of patients with disturbances of sexual differentiation of external genitalia (the lack of the testosterone transformation into 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone in peripheral tissues of men or the inborn excess of androgens in women with the congenital adrenal hyperplasia) has served as a useful clinical model for understanding factors, affecting the formation of gender. In these individuals the formal sex established according to genetic sex and somatic sex may be incompatible with gender identity and role. However, it has been found that the female gender identity is most frequently associated with the presence of ovaries or the lack of gonads (gonadal dysgenesis), while the male gender identity appear most frequently in the presence of testicular tissue irrespective of female or hermaphrodite (intersex) phenotype. In genetic men with the absence of male genitalia formation, caused by the aberrant function of androgen receptor, the gender identity depends on the severity of the disorder: female gender identity in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and female or male gender identity in the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and female or male in the partial androgen insensitivity. These clinical observations confirm the experimental data indicating androgen role in the male gender identity creation. This knowledge is necessary for the decision of the direction of surgical correction of sex organs in children with ambiguous genitalia, which should not depend on the expected efficiency to perform sexual intercourse, but mostly on the expected or already present individual gender identity.",

      "title": "Gender and Family Status Across the Life Course: Constraints on Five Types of Leisure",
      "abstract": "Abstract The family context is considered as it impacts involvement in culturally defined categories of leisure: active, passive, entertainment, social leisure and TV-viewing as well as total leisure are considered. How does family context, which varies across the life course, constrain leisure? Does family context have the same impact for men and women and for married and unmarried? These issues are examined for a subset of a national sample of adults (N=782) who provided behavioral data through multi-day time budget diaries. Using comparable samples of time from each individual, analysis of variance is used to test for differences in means. Family structure is examined as it constrains and facilitates various types of leisure. Women, and in particular, single mothers, are expected to be disadvantaged in terms of leisure time and involvement. Results indicate a more complex interplay of family context, gender-and-marital status and types of leisure. Women in general are not disadvantaged in terms of leisure time, although involvement in types of leisure vary for men and women. Family context often leads to higher or lower amounts of leisure. Post hoc explanations are often necessary, since predictions of differences between those not currently parents and parents were too simple. Models that take family development context and gender into account seem necessary to understand the constraints and opportunities for leisure participation. Résumé Comment le contexte familial, qui varie avec les années, influe-t-il sur la participation aux catégories de loisir définies culturellement comme suit: loisir actif, loisir passif, spectacles, loisir social et écoute de la télévision, et loisir total? Quelles contraintes impose-t-il au loisir? A-t-il le même impact sur les femmes et les hommes, ou sur les personnes mariées et célibataires? La présente étude analyse ces questions à partir du sous-ensemble d'un échantillon national d'adultes (N=782) dont les données comportementales proviennent de compte rendus d'emploi du temps effectués quotidiennement à plusieurs reprises. L'analyse porte sur la structure familiale compte tenu de ses nombreux éléments contraignant ou facilitant la pratique de divers types de loisir. Les auteures font l'hypothèse que les femmes, et plus particulièrement les mères de familles monoparentales, sont désavantagées quant à la participation aux activités de loisir et au temps de pratique de ces activités. Les résultats font ressortir un lien plus complexe que prévu entre le contexte familial, le statut sexuel et conjugal et les types de loisir. Les femmes en général ne sont pas désavantagées relativement au temps de loisir, bien que la participation à diverses activités de loisir varie en fonction du sexe. Le contexte familial modifie souvent à la hausse ou à la baisse la quantité de loisir. Les auteures ont souvent dû recourir à des explications postérieures à l'analyse, puisque les prédictions relatives aux différences entre les parents et ceux qui ne le sont pas étaient trop élémentaires. Des modèles permettant de tenir compte du contexte de développement familial et du sexe s'avèrent nécessaires à la compréhension des éléments contraires ou favorables à la participation au loisir. Resumen ¿ Cómo el contexto familiar, que varía según los años, influencia la participación en las categorias de tiempo libre definidas culturalmente como sigue: tiempo libre activo, liempo libre pasivo, espectáculos, tiempo libre social y escucha de la televisión como distracción total? ¿ Qué dificultades impone al tiempo libre? ¿ Tiene el mismo impacto en las mujeres que en los hombres, o en las personas casadas como en las solteras? El presente estudio analiza estas preguntas desde el punto de vista de conjunto de una muestra nacional en los adultos (N=782) en la que los resultados de comportamiento provienen del tiempo dedicado diariamente en varias ocasiones. El análisis porta sobre la estructura familiar teniendo cuenta de los numerosos elementos que dificultan o facilitan la práctica de diversos tipos de tiempo libre. Las autoras defienden la hipótesis que las mujeres, y particularmente las madres de familias monoparentales, están desaventajadas cuanto a la participación en las actividades de tiempo libre y al tiempo de práctica de estas actividades. Los resultados resaltan un lazo más complejo que previsto entre el contexto familiar, el estatuto sexual y matrimonial y los tipos de tiempo libre. Las mujeres en general no están desaventajadas en relación al tiempo libre, apesar de que la participación a diversas actividades de tiempo libre variá en función del sexo. El contexto familiar modifica con frecuencia a más o a menos la cantidad de tiempo libre. Las autoras han debido recurrir con frecuencia a explicaciones subsecuentes al análisis, puesto que las predicciones relativas a las diferencias entre los que son padres y los que no lo son eran demasiado elementales. Los modelos que permiten tener cuenta del contexto de desarrollo familiar y del sexo son necesarios para la comprensión de los elementos contrarios o favorables a la participación del tiempo libre.",

The new conceptualization of the female orgasm, however, was but formulation of a more radical eighteenth-century reinterpretation of the female body in relation to that of the male. Neither advances in reproductive biology nor anatomical discoveries seem sufficient to explain the dramatic revaluation of the female orgasm that occurred in the late eighteenth century and the even more dramatic reinterpretation of the female body in relation to that of the male. Rather, a new model of incommensurability triumphed over the old hierarchical model in the wake of new political agendas. Men and women are, in this model, not different in kind but in the configuration of their organs; the male is a hotter version of the female, or to use the teleologically more appropriate order, the female is the cooler, less perfect version of the male.",

They affect the family everyday functioning, require greater demands on adaptation and re-evaluation of the existing habits of family members and consequently may result in family dysfunction due to anxiety disorders, especially in marital relationship or partnership. However, the knowledge about the impact of anxiety disorders on one or both partners in marital or partner life is still limited.The relevant studies were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, within the period 1990-2017. Additional references were found using reviews of relevant articles. The search terms included \"anxiety disorders,\"\"marital problems,\" \"marital conflicts,\" \"partnership,\" \"family functioning,\" and \"communication.\"Dissatisfaction in a relationship can act as a trigger for the development of anxiety disorders and could also be responsible for the modulation and maintenance of these disorders. However, this dissatisfaction may also be the consequence of manifestation of the anxiety disorders. The individuals with the anxiety may feel guilty about their partners because of the tolerance and help (does not matter what kind and quality of the help he/she provides), sometimes they are submissively grateful because of the support, they may feel inferior, tend to serve him /her. On the other hand, he/she begins to rebuke partner's supposed negative attitudes; the patient may start to use his psychological problems as an excuse and expects others to help him and solve the situation. Consequently, he /she starts to check and criticize the partner and this tense situation may lead to problems in marriage and disturbs family functioning.Distress elements that contribute to the development of anxiety disorders can be diverse and sometimes it is not easy to identify so-called precipitating factors. The link between anxiety disorders and family relationships is bi-directional: psychological problems adversely affect patient relationships and attitudes of the partner towards the patient significantly affect his/her anxiety.",

Holistic care for persons with disabilities means the rehabilitation nurse intervenes when problems of sexual function are discovered, observed, or expressed. However, most people with chronic illnesses and disabilities must confront prevalent myths about their sexual nature and abilities. These myths often have their basis in the notion, common in our society, that the only people who are sexual are those who are young and beautiful. People who are obese, old, or do not conform to current standards of sexual attractiveness are usually deemed as asexual or undesirable. These narrow sterotypes have been particularly damaging to physically or mentally disabled people. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities often have special needs regarding their sexual behavior. Most of us will confront chronic illness or disability in our own lives to some degree. In addition, illnss or disability can occur at any age. In this study, I discuss some of the special needs of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities and the methods of coping with those needs. I also discuss some of the sexual concerns that people with chronic illnesses and disabilities have in common, and the assessment of sexual function and nursing strategies through literature review.",

      "title": "Guest Editors' Introduction",
      "abstract": "Xenophobia, \"the fear or hatred of the foreign(er) or strange(r),\" has some distinct, categorical presence in most discussions of some other pervasive modes of sociopolitical discrimination, such as sexism, racism, ethnocentrism, and homophobia. Yet that presence is often rendered antique, faded, or overgeneralized, if not entirely invisible. Yet again, if these \"xenophobic\" sentiments, attitudes, or practices that are vaguely anachronized or naturalized by political discourses do appear to have more currency today, why is that? One could treat xenophobia as some negligible background noise that has been there all along, or one could invert it to a kind of master concept that purportedly unites and explains all or most of the impulses or forms of discriminatory or exclusionary practices. While immediately relevant to the line of inquiry pursued in the articles in this issue, still lost in the standard accounts—including those of the second variety noted, which might appear more robust than the first—are the nuanced specificities and manifestations of xenophobia in the United States and its critical, practical edges: how xenophobia targets specific groups with the assumption or assertion that they do not or cannot have legal-political membership, nor have they ever belonged in some nation-state—this is typically an internal accusation aimed at national-outsiders or auslanders.The papers presented in this special issue, \"Xenophobia and Racism,\" set out to articulate the conceptual and contextual significance of xenophobia vis-à-vis that of racism, along with the affective and discursive dynamic between the two. The essays address, from various perspectives, a series of questions key to this inquiry: What is xenophobia? What is its relation to racism? How does contemporary psychological research on prejudice and bias help to conceptualize xenophobia? How does the explication of the meaning of xenophobia and its prominence, or lack thereof, as a conceptual checkpoint at national sites and borders impact debates in the justice or ethics of immigration, and social inclusion more broadly?Inspired by the contemporary debate on racism in both \"analytic\" and \"Continental\" philosophy, also with a view to contributing such philosophical reflections to the wider discursive communities that form around this globally pressing issue today, namely, of the \"foreign other,\" this project seeks to promote thematically anchored, border-crossing, genre-bending discussions on xenophobia from within and beyond the racism debate in both areas of philosophical discourses in the United States and beyond. With that in mind, we have organized the innovative pieces gathered in this issue into two parts, the first advancing conceptual articulations and historical backgrounds of xenophobia and racism, and the second offering analyses of their sociocultural and political embodiments in the United States today.Part 1 opens with Robert Bernasconi's \"Where Is Xenophobia in the Fight against Racism?,\" in which he argues for ever more vigilant, conceptual distinctions, if not disconnections, between xenophobia and racism, with a view to keeping the institutional structural force of racism critically disclosed; that is, not having it obscured by certain psycho-biologizing languages. To that end, he explores the origin of the term racism in the Nazi anti-Semitic discourse along with its early articulation by UNESCO, which names and condemns biologically based racial ideology. As Bernasconi goes on to note, this framing of racism in terms of biologically focused ideology and not an institutional system met with resistance in the United States and in the French colonies from antiracist intellectuals such as Cox, Sartre, and Fanon, and yet the association of xenophobia with a natural psychological predisposition remains. Thus, the paper warns that \"those who want to blur increasingly the difference between the two terms should be on their guard against, perhaps unwittingly, reinforcing the narrow use of the term racism.\" In a similar vein, David Haekwon Kim and Ronald R. Sundstrom's paper, \"Xenophobia and Racism,\" contends that xenophobia, not prominent enough or properly understood in the contemporary debate, is distinct from racism and even nativism. The claim is concretized by the pointed observation that at the core of xenophobia is civic exclusion. Focusing on the finely scaled categorical watermarks left by differential interplays between xenophobia and racism, the third selection in part 1, Kyoo Lees \"Xenoracism and Double Whiteness: How Ben Franklin, 'True-blue English/First American,' Still Confuses Us,\" offers an interstitial articulation of some transhistorical and transatlantic resonances between Arizona's xenophobic, border-cultural politics today and the repressed exemplarity of Franklin's (post-)colonial identity disorder back then, which, together in turn, illustrate the compound concept she introduces here, namely, \"xenoracism\" the amalgamated categorical interactions of xenophobia and racism, a porous sub(terranean) genre rather than sealed subset of xenophobia or racism, where the foreign is racialized and particular \"aliens\" become further alienized at once with catalytic, categorical reciprocity, through this double lens of whiteness that is both racial and ethno-cultural.In part 2 of the issue, José Jorge Mendoza in \"Discrimination and the Presumptive Rights of Immigrants\" turns to the discussion on public policy and the contemporary debate over immigrant rights, to show the thorny irreducibility of xenophobia in such discursive scenes how the immigration debate in both analytic ethics and political philosophy all quickly agrees that racism is not grounds from the exclusion of immigrants and then dismisses the problem. Confronting xenophobia for what it is then entails arguing for more immigrant rights as well as more extensive and deeper consciousness-raising across the board. For such xenophobic encounters unfold on various registers both macro and micro, as observed in Cynthia Willett and Julie Willett on laughter, \"Going to Bed White and Waking up Arab On Xenophobia, Affect Theories of Laughter, and the Social Contagion of the Comic Stage.\" The Willetts show how politicized affects such as xenophobia, appearing in the form of fear convertible to laughter, become contagious during times of national crises such as the post-9/11 United States, where the rhetoric of anti-Arab fear also readily receives comic twists that critique, confront, and convert the phobia itself.These essays inaugurate a categorically focused, contextually informed discussion about xenophobia, and we are delighted that it is taking place in the pages of Critical Philosophy of Race, an integral part of a long movement in philosophy in the United States to investigate race, racism, and its interconnections to sexism, homophobia, classism, and other forms of exclusion, oppression, and domination. Critical in its spirit and orientation, the journal also stands in the tradition of critical social theory in which unjust social practices and structures are theorized and critiqued. It is fitting that this progressive philosophical venue considers topics such as xenophobia not only in relation to race and racism but also in view of its inseparable, topical connection to transnational global issues, with which contemporary philosophy has shown increasing concern. Here it is vital that philosophical inquiries remain not only intellectually dynamic but also critically transformative.We would like to thank the contributors for their work and patience as this project was developed over the last few years; we owe each of you many and many more thanks. Also, we very much appreciate all the feedback from the host of anonymous reviewers who read, commented, and criticized each paper with extraordinary care and expertise, which helped not only sharpen and enrich each contribution but also fine-tune and enrich the issue as a whole. So again, thank you: know who you are. Finally, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the editors of Critical Philosophy of Race for so generously inviting us to edit this special issue, and for offering invaluable editorial insights that improved each paper and the collective project itself.",

The symbolism, significance, and meaning of the phallus or penis has varied historically and across disciplines. In the psychoanalytic tradition, “the subject…can only assume its identity through the adoption of a sexed identity, and the subject can only take up a sexed identity with reference to the phallus, for ‘the phallus is the privileged signifier’” (Segal 2007: 85). Jacques Lacan’s work has inspired feminist critiques of “phallocentrism” in high and popular cultural texts since the 1970s (Segal 2007). Elizabeth Stephens (2007) describes the ancient Greek ideal of small penises as indexing self-control and rationality, while the Romans celebrated virility and power, which they associated with a large penis. Other scholarship has explored the racialization of penis size, such as the stereotype of Black men as possessing large penises, indexing hypersexuality and often depicted in racist terms as representing aggression or lack of civility (Lehman 2006).",

      "abstract": "Up to the present, the phenomenon of equality–and thus its consolidation into an autonomous right, namely the human right of or treatment–manifests serious problems in theory and practice. \nAs Leibniz exhibited, equality is not purely understandable on its own terms. In order to not confuse the phenomena's quality with a substantive (judgmental) corrective is required. If one does not want to confuse with identity, the determination of always requires a further evaluative element. \nLegal professionals solve this requirement in legal systems pragmatically by implementing positivistic criterions, such as age, sex, race, that constitute their conception of in law. However, even this pragmatic positivist approach has its shortcomings. The question arises, if the criterions, that are not part of the above mentioned positivistic catalogue [e.g.: physical ugliness, low property or financial position, low educational level] open the possibility to legally discriminate affected people. Such non-listed 'discriminations' already drop out of the scope of the catalogue. Hence, they do structurally not meet the requirement of equality/non-discrimination. \nAs this kind of discrimination does not fulfil the element of the non-discrimination norm, legitimation does even not require a legal examination or justification of its legitimacy by a justification test. \nThis contribution raises a number of questions that are still unanswered or sufficiently discussed. They could be solved, amongst others, by opening up equal treatment for a variety of elements of discrimination. In addition the open social questions about the justification of such characteristics, a number of aspects of the compatibility of national rights with other, possibly higher-ranked, legal norms – e.g. Human Rights – must be considered in this legal context. Considering that the granting of of one person regularly implies the loss of the freedom of another person, a more differentiated view of – oriented towards the rights of freedom – seems to be beneficial.",

Fourth, women's sexuality tends to be more malleable and capable of change over time.

      "abstract": "This work aims to reflect on the configuration of the male and female archetypes, which began to outline a list of characteristics and values marked with the sign of good or evil. The opposition between Nature and Culture led to the legitimation of the attributes of the masculine archetype\nover the feminine one, prescribing a relation of dominion over Nature/feminine/Woman. Patriarchy versus Matriarchy: archetypal phases that contributed to the configuration of radically different if not opposed cultural imaginaries. This archetypal transition corresponds to the transition from the myth of nature to the myth of Reason, dominated by the masculine and its symbols. Women are denied access to knowledge and above all self-knowledge in a repressive attempt to preserve her from erotic events or social adventures. However, The sexual revolution that has been going on\nfor more than fifty years seems to have run its course because sexual liberation without emotional involvement has turned out to be more convenient for men, but it does not correspond to the most intimate aspirations of women. At present, eroticism, exhibitionism, the cult of the body converted into consumer values are nothing more than substitute satisfactions, useful\nto the system. We would therefore be facing a new phase of alienation denounced by Marx and Simmel that affects the woman again, because in the end the female body remains “a body for others”.",

      "abstract": "The characteristics of sleep during puberty are discussed from the physiological aspect of hormone secretion and from the social aspect of reduced sleep time. Many types of hormones show an increased rate of secretion during sleep at night. Thus, sleep cannot simply be said to represent a stoppage of activities, and rather it comprises another form of 'activity.' During puberty, in par- ticular, the secretion of sexual hormones increases during sleep. Sleep is therefore assumed to play a role in promoting the maturation of sexual function. However, in Japan, the amount of sleep time that junior-high school students get has been on the decline. One of the factors contributing to this decline is that students are going to bed at increasingly later times. Students who go to sleep at late hours at night show a high incidence of problems, such as feeling unwell when they awake in the morning, being unable to consume breakfast, having irregular bowel movements, feeling drowsy during the day, and physically feeling they didn't get a sufficient amount of sleep at night, as well as other problems. Because the same group tends to show similar symptoms even during summer vacation when the number of hours of sleep increases, it is clear that this is not simply due to reduced sleep time. Accordingly, the increasingly later times at which they go to sleep must be recog- nized as a major problem.",

The definition of sexuality is given as \"the quality of being sexual or having sex; the possession of sexual powers or capability of sexual feelings; the recognition of or preoccupation with what is sexual\"; this is a rather bland if clear formulation. The Freudian conception of sexuality is extremely comprehensive. It disagrees with common psychological accounts of the sexual instinct as a predetermined behaviour, typifying a species, having a relatively fixed object, and with an obvious aim. Infantile sexuality is significant only after the move from unintegration to integration has been effected. In the extensive historical, sociological and anthropological scholarship on the \"family\", families always involve relationships that extend, possibly with different meanings and forms, across the generations and across the sexes.",

In the normal being, male or female, all characteristics are expected to be of one gender, harmonious with the chromosomal pattern established in the zygote at the time of fertilization. However, the bisexual potential inherent in everyone may result in the emergence of abnormalities both physical and psychological. Aberrations at any of the stages of development may thus result in the incomplete or faulty differentiation of the particular component and sexual ambiguity. Ambiguous external genitalia is not a syndrome per se, but manifestation of abnormal development common to many disorders. The occurrence is approximately one in every 30,000 newborns.

For mental traits like personality, greater male variability has been partly attributed to biology, underpinned by claims that there is generally greater variation among males than females in non-human animals due to stronger sexual selection on males. However, evidence for greater male variability is limited to morphological traits, and there is little information regarding sex differences in personality-like behaviours for non-human animals. Here, we meta-analysed sex differences in means and variances for over 2100 effects (204 studies) from 220 species (covering five broad taxonomic groups) across five personality traits: boldness, aggression, activity, sociality and exploration. We also tested if sexual size dimorphism, a proxy for sex-specific sexual selection, explains variation in the magnitude of sex differences in personality. We found no significant differences in personality between the sexes. In addition, sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in the magnitude of the observed sex differences in the mean or variance in personality for any taxonomic group. In sum, we find no evidence for widespread sex differences in variability in non-human animal personality.",

Fifty-nine couples completed 21-day diary tasks during pregnancy, 2 weeks after childbirth, and 15 weeks after childbirth (i.e., up to 63 diary days). Both mothers and fathers experienced increased appearance insecurity and decreased sexual frequency and sexual satisfaction across the transition. Moreover, at times when new parents reported higher appearance insecurity or lower sexual satisfaction, they underestimated their partner’s physical attraction to them, but were not more likely to notice day-to-day fluctuations in their partner’s attraction.

The new are more persuasive than the old because of the technological changes in the means of production and dissemination, because the line be tween the real and the fictional is blurred, and because, for eco nomic reasons, the formation of habit, as well as a dulling of the critical faculties, has become desirable, especially in com mercial broadcasting. The patron of the entertainment likes what he gets, without question, and certain of his wants are satisfied. There is, however, little effort to enlarge the range of satisfactions, and so much is given that such wants as are more difficult to satisfy and such satisfaction as can stir intelli gence or criticism are generally neglected. By inducing in ertia, the mass entertainments may contribute to the specific abuses of which they are often accused, such as incitement to violence or indifference to a strict sexual code. But it is their failure to serve the independence of mind of their followers, to stir the critical faculties, that is more serious.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality, particularly during adolescence, involves personality as a whole. During puberty, which starts the process of adolescence, adolescents are faced with the fact they have not chosen their body which sends them back to the experience of passivity of childhood. It arouses in the most vulnerable adolescents what remains of expectations or affective dependence regarding their family circle, and thus they are confronted with that basic human paradox, i.e. to be oneself one has to accept to receive and to feed upon others and at the same time to be different from them. Such a fear of being dependent on others may lead adolescents to deprive themselves of what they expect to receive from others. Sexuality and the body, through the emotions they summon, are particularly subject to aggressive or rejection behaviours which characterize that age.",

The period of adolescence, a period in which an emotional and bihevioral\r\n independence from ones parents is established, as well as the time when some stonger bonds\r\n with peers are formed, is stated as the period of change and developmental tasks which is\r\n assumed to be the most suitable time for the occurence of loneliness. There are many\r\n classifications of loneliness, but the most famous one is considered to be Weisses. His\r\n classification of loneliness divides it into social (which occurs when a person is excluded from a\r\n social network) and emotional (caused by the lack of intimacy in interpersonal relationships).\r\n Loneliness can manifest in many ways, and in the most recent of times the most famous ones to\r\n be considered are affective manifestations which can lead to a state of anxiety, unrest and\r\n tension. In many situations it is very difficult to recognize the difference between the behaviours\r\n which directly led to the state of loneliness and behaviours which are the result of loneliness in\r\n adolescence. One of the potential problems in adolescence is stress which is conected to\r\n socializing with peers. Peers establish social relations, which then form a social network. Social\r\n network is important because it shows the quality and quantity of the relations of lonely and\r\n potentially lonely persons with others whom they are close to. This view puts into perspective\r\n the importance of reciprocity of closeness. In conclusion, loneliness can include some pshychic,\r\n bihevioural and cognitive problems which can be resolved with different types of therapy.",

      "abstract": "To date, the body image literature has largely ignored older men, as the bulk of the research has focused on young and middle-aged women. Where studies have been conducted with older men, they have tended to only consider the perspectives of men in their 50s and 60s or to include older men as part of mixed gender or diverse age samples. Thus, little is known about how older men perceive, experience, and feel about their aging and changing bodies, even as the body is central to older men’s understanding and practice of masculinity as well as their position in age- and gender-based systems of inequality. Addressing this gap in the research, we conducted in-depth interviews with 22 community-dwelling men aged 67–90 years (average age of 77 years). Drawing upon age relations and masculinities theorizing, we asked the men about how they evaluated and felt about their appearances, health, physical abilities, and sexual functioning. Our thematic analysis revealed that the men were largely satisfied with their appearances and physical functioning, particularly their approximation to masculine ideals of youthfulness, healthiness, and independence. Whereas half of the men identified their weight as a source of body satisfaction, all of the men disparaged obesity and stereotypical older men’s enlarged stomachs in particular. That said, the men discounted appearance as an unimportant and feminized concern. In contrast, they emphasized the salience of health and body functionality, expressing concern about how changes to their physical abilities and sexual functioning had already affected, and might in the future increasingly delimit, their daily lives, and hence they preferred social and physical pursuits. We consider our findings in light of age and masculinity ideals, which collectively privilege youthful bodies and subordinate older men.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In our society men are considered more impulsive than women, especially in the violent and sexual domain. This correlation of sex and impulsivity might trace back to enhanced male impulsivity in general or a domain specific effect of emotions on impulsivity. The evidence for sex differences in the interaction of emotional or sexual stimuli and impulsivity has been relatively inconclusive so far. In this study, we investigated the effects of various emotional stimuli on responsivity in a Go/No-Go task. Participants had to respond quickly to a visual cue and withhold their response to another visual cue, while different emotional pictures were presented in the background, including sexual stimuli, non-sexual positive stimuli and negative stimuli. Both men ( N = 37) and women ( N = 38) made most commission errors in the sexual condition, indicating a disinhibiting effect in both genders. On top of this, men made even more commission errors than women, specifically in the sexual condition and not in other conditions. Men rated sexual stimuli as more positive, but did not differ from women in arousal ratings and pupil dilation. These findings may partly indicate increased impulsive behavior under sexual arousal in men, most likely driven by enhanced approach motivation due to more positive value but not higher arousal of sexual stimuli. The results are consistent with the theory of evolutionarily based concealment of sexual interest in women.",

      "abstract": "Gender differences in experience of first intercourse are among the largest in sexuality research, with women recalling less pleasure and satisfaction than men. This \"enjoyment gap\" has not been considered in explanations of gender differences in sexual desire. Yet, reinforcement and incentive learning feature prominently in recent models of women's sexual desire, and nonhuman animal models demonstrate their impact at sexual debut. We examined whether women's lower sexual desire is explained by their gender or by gendered experience of enjoyment at sexual debut. Emerging adults (N = 838) provided retrospective accounts of physical (orgasm) and affective (satisfaction) enjoyment at (hetero)sexual debut. We replicated gender differences across behavioral, general, and multidimensional measures of trait sexual desire; however, they were contingent on experience and measurement method. When its cognitive multidimensional properties were appreciated, women's sexual desire varied with experience of orgasm at sexual debut and diverged from men's only when orgasm did not occur. Such effects were not observed for satisfaction, nor for men. Nor did effects of a control event - masturbatory debut - extend beyond solitary sexual desire. Findings underscore the importance of orgasm equality, and suggest its absence at sexual debut may play an unacknowledged role in differentiating sexual desire.",

The focus here is on oral sex within heterosexual relations, but oral sex plays an important part in homosexual relations. In some historical configurations of sexual practices in South Asia, for instance, the tasting of another man's semen was thought to stimulate the desire for heterosexual intercourse. In another configuration, fellatio was seen as a substitute for heterosexual intercourse, something to be received from a eunuch, but certainly not by a man from his wife. In the west, oral sex was often subject to legal prohibitions against “sodomy,” both hetero‐ and homosexual, and in some states in the United States it remains a criminal offense.",

This responsiveness can affect her focus on the performance, and in turn, inhibit the performance body. In other words, if the female actor is overly concerned about securing the wellbeing of her socio-cultural body by taming her performance body, she may not be able to reach her potential in the artistic treatment of the character. In most cases, the female actor attempts to defend her socio-cultural body during a performance and as a result of this, generate signs that are not congruent with the role/situation.",

      "abstract": "One of the developments in modern science today is a surgery to change genitals in humans.This has become an important issue in society because of the pros and cons. The mostopposed groups are religious groups. Some countries have legalized this action while othershave not. The backgrounds of people deciding to change their genitals are twofold: first,because they feel they are in the “wrong body” where their behavior is contrary to thegenitals they have. Second, the development of genital devices is not perfect. That is why anaxiology study needs to be made on the decision to change the genitals in humans. Axiologyitself means the science or theory of the nature of values which investigates values in terms oftheir nature, their size, and their metaphysical status relating to their usefulness. In axiology,Max Scheler gave four levels of value, namely: (1) The value of “enjoyment” or “pleasure”(agreeable) and “dislike” or “displeasure” (disagreeable); (2) The value of vitality or welfareor life (vital feeling); (3) Spiritual values; (4) Holiness or holy value. Of the four values ofMax Scheler, it was found that the decision to change the genitals in humans does not havethe essence of any value except just the value of enjoyment or pleasure. That is, this kind ofaction actually denies the nature of existing values. The value of enjoyment obtained throughsex change surgery is actually only “mortal” or for a moment enjoyment because it isprecisely the disappointment that appears at the end. It is just the lowest value out of four.Therefore, the author suggested that those who feel themselves trapped in the “wrong body”are better off doing psychiatric and religious therapy so that the nature of the values that theyhave can be developed rather than making changes to the genitals.",

Within this framework, “woman” is associated with characteristics such as passive, responsive, and inferior.

The cultural investment in binarization, particularly between the two sexes, also produces heterosexuality as the only normative form of desire, and privileges so‐called masculine values and experiences over so‐called feminine values.

Developmentally normal children possess an inherent biological drive for sucking, the explanation for which can be found in both psychoanalytic and learning theory. Psychoanalytic theory contends that non-nutritive sucking represents a biological drive resulting from pleasurable stimulation of the lips and mouth; learning theory proposes that the infant learns to associate sucking with pleasurable feelings such as satiety or being held. Whatever the theoretical basis, thumbsucking generally is viewed as a biological drive that develops into a habit, which in the majority of cases resolves by age 4 years, but can persist much longer.",

Besides the many factors, such as heredity, increased sensory conduction and reception, deficient muscular forces, etc., that influence childbirth, I believe there is a marked difference on the pelvis in the physiologic effect of the exercise performed.

Some argue that such a focus will divert family planning programs from their original mission and close off sources of funding. These arguments overlook the impossibility of isolating family planning from sexuality. An exclusive emphasis on contraception leads to the medicalization of the public aspect of sexuality and a dismissal of the intense emotions associated with sexual activity. A medical view of sexuality leads, in turn, to an emphasis on changing individual behaviors and blaming couples involved in unplanned pregnancies. An alternative approach is to help people to take control of and enjoy their sexuality, relationships, and fertility. Moreover, the same laws, institutions, and social values that prevent couples from controlling their fertility (through restrictions on abortion, for example) shape internal and external concepts of sexuality. The provision of contraceptives to adolescents is not sufficient in a social context where girls feed shame if they engage in premarital sex and guilty if they refuse and boys are not encouraged to assume co-responsibility for sexual encounters.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite increasing legal protections and supportive attitudes toward sexual minorities (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]) in recent decades, suicidality remains more common among this population than among heterosexuals. While barriers to societal integration have been widely theorized as determinants of suicidality for the general population, they have not been comprehensively explored to explain the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality and/or compared to more established contributors. Methods Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which randomly collected data from individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2010 to 2015 (1,281 (2.2%) self-identified as LGB). Analyses examined sexual orientation differences in suicidality (i.e., past-12-month ideation and attempts), and explored the role of barriers to societal integration (i.e., not living with a partner or children, unemployment, and lack of societal trust) in explaining this disparity over-and-above more commonly explored psychological (e.g., depression, substance use) and interpersonal (e.g., discrimination, victimization, lack of social support) suicidality risk factors. Results Compared to heterosexuals, suicidal ideation and attempts were more common among both gay men/lesbians (AORideation: 2.51; AORattempts: 4.66), and bisexuals (AORideation: 3.76; AORattempts: 6.06). Barriers to societal integration mediated the association between sexual orientation and suicidality even in models adjusting for established risk factors for suicidality. Conclusions The disproportionate barriers to societal integration that LGB individuals experience seem important contributors to the elevated risk of suicidality among sexual minorities. Preventive interventions should consider innovative ways to foster societal integration within sexual minority populations and to adjust hetero-centric social institutions to better include sexual minorities.",

      "abstract": "There are undeniably clear differences between women’s and men’s expectations, attitudes and behaviour in relation to work organisations, and these distinctions solidify as individuals rise up the hierarchy. Men push for career success, and achieve seniority, or they come to terms with having underachieved. Women’s experience is more complex. Socialisation into femininity is not as clear cut as masculinity and women do not have equivalent expectations of certain success. Women who do succeed in management or the professions are more likely to increase the problems and stress in their lives than if they opt out and the more senior a woman becomes the more she is likely to be stressed at work than a man of equivalent seniority. There are good social reasons why women find the high-flying life difficult, particularly if they are mothers. However, there are additional difficulties for senior women particularly in relation to the management of psychological boundaries between self, social context and in particular their sense of gendered subjectivity. The desire to achieve professionally does not preclude the desire to be feminine, enjoy being a woman and being seen as a woman with a sexual, intellectual and emotional presence that is feminine.",

After years of aversion gaze, the tabloid press have suddenly discovered child sexual abuse and have over-sensationalized a complex and painful subject. Sexual abuse is not confined to nubile daughters and their fathers. It can occur at birth and continue throughout a whole lifetime. The causes of sexually transmitted diseases in children should always be investigated as should excessive masturbation and sexually provocative behaviour. The sad thing is that abused children do not know the difference between affection and sexual behaviour. Thus their behaviour can subject them to further abuse. Sexually abused children feel betrayed and respond to being used as a sexual object. They feel spoilt, debased and violated. Bewildering feelings of guilt are mixed with anger and shame. Children can leave the household, marry, have their own children and still be lured back into the sexually abusing set-up.",

      "abstract": "Psychophysical, neurological and sociological dualisms between the sexes are the main causes of an incompatible male-female unions-communities (friendship, romantic relationship, marriage or extramarital community). As long as the woman's body (it's a different mechanism for men) does not get used to the \"hormones and substances of love\": phenyl ethylamine, nor ephedrine, dopamine, oxytocin, endorphin, etc. a woman does not initiate a struggle to free herself from a position of inferiority in relation to a man (emancipation), because the community between a man and a woman is dominated by love, which abstracts the inherited, constructed and socially accepted differences between the sexes. The emancipation of a woman within the formed man-woman community begins with the adaptation of the organism to the \"hormones and substances of love\", which is time-specific and determined by the personal character, temperament and structure of the formed community. The emancipation of women in community with men is initiated and then developed by the dualism of psychophysical, neurological, and then constructed sociological differences between the sexes. In the paper, the genesis of dualisms between the sexes, their social adoption, with corrections resulting from the process of women's emancipation, as well as the consequences suffered by incompatible formed male-female communities in today's contemporary industrial-technological society, are presented in a simplified manner.",

      "title": "Appearances deceive: female “resistance” behaviour in a sepsid fly is not a test of male ability to hold on",
      "abstract": "Female rejections of males are crucial events in sexual selection by female choice and sexually antagonistic coevolution, but there are few detailed studies of the process of rejection. Female struggles when mounted by males are often assumed to function to dislodge the male. But this study, in which female receptivity was manipulated by using females of different ages, showed that this \"dislodgement\" males. Mounts in Archisepsis diversiformis often failed, but males were nevertheless seldom thrown off; instead, they almost always dismounted while the female was quiet. Males also showed signs of being in control of dismounts, as they dismounted more quickly if the female had recently been mounted by another male. Predictions from two other hypotheses for the function of female resistance behaviour also either failed or were not consistently supported: (1) females resist in order to filter males with respect to their ability to hold on to the female or outlast her resistance, or to court while mounted (\"male endurance/female exhaustion\" hypothesis); (2) females resist in order to sense the male's grip on her wings and thus filter males with respect to their species-specific clamps or to elicit other male courtship (\"male screening\" hypothesis). Several predictions of a further possibility, that (3) females resist in order to communicate their lack of receptivity to the male, and to induce him to leave (\"communication\" hypothesis), hypothesis is incorrect in a group (sepsid flies) in which energetic female shaking behaviour was previously interpreted as female attempts to dislodge were confirmed. Although one type of data did not fit easily with the communication hypothesis, overall it was the most likely explanation for female shaking behaviour. Our results call into question conclusions from previous studies regarding male-female conflict in this and other groups, and suggest testable alternative hypotheses. A survey of behaviour in other flies (which are presumably indicative of other animals in this respect) indicates that female \"resistance\" behaviour probably has a variety of functions. In sum, facile interpretations of a forceful resistance function should not be accepted without careful analyses.",

      "title": "Is sexual craving a sign of sex addiction?",
      "abstract": "There is increasing recognition of the significance of craving in the addiction field; however, there are differences between substance and behavioural cravings, such as sexual cravings. Further research is needed to quantify and differentiate between egodystonic and egosyntonic cravings, and psychophysiological measures could provide a deeper understanding of behavioural cravings. Pleasure and its relevance to addiction has been overlooked in mental health research and requires more attention. Craving has a very long history in the addiction field. In the early days, many authors questioned the relevance of the craving concept for addictive behaviours [1, 2]. After decades of research into craving, however, studies have increasingly demonstrated the relevance of this concept for addictive behaviour. It is, for example, currently part of the DSM criteria [3, 4], and many studies have shown that craving is an important predictor of relapse [5, 6]. However, there are still many issues that are not fully understood or addressed. One such issue is whether craving for substances is similar in nature to craving associated with behavioural addictions. Miele and colleagues [7] ask an important but scarcely addressed question: what about behavioural cravings such as sexual cravings? Although, as Miele et al. show, there are many similarities between substance craving and sexual craving, there are also differences. Unlike alcohol and drug addiction, sexual addiction has different characteristics because sexual desire is also, at least for most people, a normal and healthy behaviour. The authors aptly introduce the term ‘egodystonic’ to address this issue. I assume they are referring to desires that conflict with an individual’s ideal self-concept. I would argue that future research should explore possible ways of further quantifying this construct. Is there really a difference between egodystonic or problematic cravings and egosyntonic or non-conflicting cravings? Are there mere quantitative differences in terms of frequency and intensity or are there also qualitative differences? I predict that it will be difficult to differentiate between egodystonic and egosyntonic sexual craving, especially in the field of sexual violence, where it is likely that craving will be presented as egodystonic. As sexual craving is still taboo and there are possible legal consequences, it will be unlikely that self-reports alone could reveal meaningful insights into this particular topic. For example, a sexual offender is likely to explain the offence by pointing towards an egodystonic (‘I was not myself’) rather than an egosyntonic mechanism. Psychophysiological measures, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), could be employed to gain a richer understanding of the nature of behavioural cravings, including sexual craving. Although it is tempting to look for similarities, there is work showing remarkable differences between the psychophysiology associated with sexual craving and that associated with alcohol and drug craving. One notable difference was found in a study by Prause and colleagues [8], who found opposite results to the addiction models. That is, participants with problematic and ‘excessive’ viewing of visual sexual stimuli, who were reported to have higher sexual desire, had lower EGG responses to sexual images compared to non-sexual images. This may indicate some kind of habituation to addictive sexual stimuli rather than a sensitization, as seen in other addictions. The similarities and dissimilarities between problematic substance use and sexual addiction clearly need to be clarified. Pleasure in general, including sexual pleasure, is poorly understood. Pleasure and pain play a fundamental role in motivating human behaviour. While pain and anxiety are extensively studied in psychology, pleasure is often neglected. The study of (lack of) pleasure has been largely overlooked in mental health research, including addiction. The challenge is to clearly define healthy/normal and distinguish it from unhealthy/problematic. Understanding these differences in the concept of pleasure is crucial to understanding complex human behaviours and disorders such as drug, alcohol and sexual addiction.

      "abstract": "Fifty years ago, craving was defined as an \"urgent and overpowering desire, or irresistible impulse\", but subsequently, craving definitions have been modified by many authors and no unique definition of this phenomena, or a consensus in regards to its manifestation and significance exists. This review discusses the contemporary views of alcohol craving. Issues such as definition and different types, dynamics of craving, its mediators and moderators and clinical correlations are explored.We focused on the literature search (MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, and EMBASE) and new findings in the addiction field, especially paying attention on the study of craving.There is growing evidence to suggest that craving is associated with different aspects of addiction (i.e. withdrawal, relapse) and clinical characteristics such as depression and anxiety. These different phenomena contribute individual differences in intensity, frequency and types of craving. At present, there are several different models to better describe the complexity of craving.Craving is not an exact, precisely measurable value but it is rather an uncertain, descriptive phenomenon. Further research (biological, sociological and psychological) should be orientated primarily toward exploration of the relationship between environmental factors and personality variables and craving and its maintenance, with special attention to gender differences.",

      "abstract": "For a long time, newborns, and especially premature newborns, were thought to “feel nothing”. Nowadays, there is clear evidence that they are aware of their environment and that numerous sensory stimulations can positively or negatively impact them. The aim of the present communication is to 1) review the current knowledge on the fetuses and newborns' perceptual world from the first weeks post-conception to the first days after birth. Indeed, newborns are able to perceive subtle information through different sensory modalities (tactile, visual, olfactory, gustatory and auditory), but also to associate these different types of information providing them with a multimodal knowledge of their environment. 2) to highlight and explain the remaining issues and divergences existing in the literature. Thus, we identify a series of internal (sex, age) and external (environmental, including care practices) factors as well as methodological aspects that could explain discrepancies or even lead to controversies. Finally, we propose lines of research and highlight the interest of ethological approaches for improving our knowledge of the newborns' perceptual world. Examples of animal studies illustrate the interest of taking into account aspects that may have been overlooked such as for example the importance of sensory laterality and the impact of inappropriate postpartum stimulations on long-term social and emotional development. Finally, examples of the use of our ethological approaches to study premature and at term newborn sensory perception will be given.",

They are not. Ethics is concerned with the human person in relation to the good, as a matter of judgement and action (see, for example, Aristotle 2000, esp. Book I). Ethical discourses, as they are repetitively (yet variably) articulated in society, produce the human individual conceptually and socially as a physical and ethical subject. This is done through the construction of stereotypes (which are of course never fully realised by any one individual) and the elision of 'difficult' or 'intermediate' types (through marginalisation, erasure or 'forgetting'). Any ethical subject also has a 'constitutive outside', a set of overt and contrasting categories and stereotypes through which 'others' are understood as different from the ethical subject itself (but without which the ethical subject is not fully intelligible). These may be human others, distinguished by age, sex, race/ethnicity, religion, language, class or any other set of markers, to which an ethical authority or discourse may appeal (see, for example, Aristotle 1996, esp. Books I–III). Or indeed these others may be animals, divinities or spirits (which resemble animals or humans in various ways), or mythological or cult entities of ambiguous status.",

      "abstract": "L'omofobia e una forma di violenza basata sulla vulnerabilita di un certo gruppo di persone a causa del loro (vero o presunto) orientamento sessuale che produce non solo discriminazione ma anche invisibilita. Cerchero di articolare, nel tempo assegnato, il fenomeno dell'omofobia con questi tre elementi. In anzi tutto, cominciamo per cercare da definire l'omofobia la quale e caratterizzata dall'atteggiamento di ostilita nei confronti degli omosessuali, uomini o donne che siano. Se la componente primaria dell'omofobia e effettivamente un rifiuto irrazionale o addirittura un odio verso gay e lesbiche, essa non puo tuttavia essere ridotta solo a questo. Come la xenofobia, il razzismo o l'antisemitismo, l'omofobia e una manifestazione arbitraria che consiste nel designare l'altro in quanto contrario, inferiore o anomalo. Nella sua irriducibile differenza, l'altro viene situato altrove, al di fuori dell'ambito comune degli esseri umani. Crimine abominevole, amori vergognosi, gusti depravati, costumi infami, passione ignominiosa, peccato contro natura, sodomitico, sono altrettante designazioni che per secoli hanno definito il desiderio e le relazioni sessuali o affettive tra persone dello stesso sesso. Relegato a emarginato o ad eccentrico, l'omosessuale viene designato dalla norma sociale come un essere bizzarro, strano o strambo. E siccome il male viene sempre da fuori, in Francia l'omosessualita e stata chiamata vizio italiano, costume arabo o coloniale. Come il nero, l'arabo o lo straniero, l'omosessuale e sempre l'altro, il differente, quello con cui qualunque identificazione resta impensabile. La recente preoccupazione per questa ostilita nei confronti dei gay e delle lesbiche modifica il modo in cui la questione e stata finora affrontata. Invece di concentrarsi come in passato allo studio del comportamento omosessuale in quanto deviante, l'attenzione viene ormai posta sulle ragioni che hanno portato a considerare come deviante proprio questa forma di sessualita: lo spostamento dell'oggetto d'analisi verso l'omofobia corrisponde ad un cambiamento tanto epistemologico che politico. Epistemologico, dal momento che non si tratta tanto di conoscere o di comprendere l'origine e il funzionamento dell'omosessualita, quanto di analizzare l'ostilita suscitata da questa specifica forma di orientamento sessuale.",

      "title": "Male infertility and its effect on male sexuality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Male infertility may occur as a consequence of psychological or physical problems or a combination thereof. On learning of their infertility patients usually go through an initial emotional crisis. The male response thereafter varies depending on the aetiology of the infertility. Male factor infertility threatens the traditional male/father role and results in a feeling of personal and sexual inadequacy. This may resolve itself in extramarital affairs or by the sufferer throwing himself into his work. Unfortunately treatment for infertility often has transient negative effects on male sexuality, and is frequently believed by the recipient to be more successful than in fact it is.",

Of the sterilized women, 90% report better health and marital or socioeconomic adjustment. The type and time of operation affects the final attitude. Hysterectomy, not so traumatic as believed except in insecure women, prevents future pathology or dissatisfaction with minor discomfort such as menstruation. Unsatisfied maternal feelings or changed family circumstances can be tolerated with adjustment unless the woman is unstable. Nearly all vasectomized men report some or better health and sexual satisfaction. Some studies find increased \"masculine role behavior\" in compensation for infertility; others note stigma of deviancy in some societies. Other factors that affect acceptance are coersion, motivation, social class, adequate briefing, and sympathetic handling by significant persons during decision.",

      "title": "Feminist Bioethics",
      "abstract": "Bioethics emerged as an academic discipline in the 1960s and 1970s, largely in response to social and technological changes that challenged established attitudes and practices. Feminist bioethics is premised upon the notion that both the focus of traditional bioethics, and its very concepts, are imbued with unacknowledged androcentric bias, thereby marginalising gender as a significant category when considering the ethical issues that arise in the biological and life sciences. Feminists are particularly concerned about the asocial and self-interested nature attributed to the universal agent. Despite differences between theorists, feminist ethics and bioethics generally assumes that gender is a morally salient feature of individuals. Relational autonomy is the term used to describe feminist approaches to understanding and analyzing autonomy. Relational theory has been hugely influential in feminist bioethics. Feminist bioethics has moved far beyond an early focus on reproduction, although aspects of reproduction such as surrogacy, uterus transplantation, gender selection and genetic technologies continue to attract attention.",

      "abstract": "The role of ‘naming’ and what we commonly call ‘memory’ has become a\nhighly contested space in debates around sexual violence across many\nparts of the world. Feminist activism and cultural changes during the last\nthirty years have allowed women to address or reconstruct events in their\nlives in unprecedented ways. Experiences of sexual violence have been redefined, re-called, re-membered and re-constituted as ideas about what is\npossible, acceptable or normal have been transformed. Alongside this, the\nline between knowing and not knowing, forgetting and remembering,\navoiding and confronting, has become a dynamic and often explicitly\nnegotiated one. Nowhere has this been more marked than in the field of\nchildhood sexual abuse. As the philosopher, Ian Hacking, comments:You might think that the experiences speak for themselves, at least for\nthe victims. Yes – and yet events, no matter how painful or terrifying,\nhave been experienced or recalled as child abuse only after\nconsciousness-raising. That requires inventing new descriptions, providing new ways to see old acts – and a great deal of social agitation.",

      "title": "Evaluating performance costs of sexually selected traits",
      "abstract": "Summary Aspects of locomotor performance are thought to be important in a variety of natural contexts, including foraging and escaping from predators. The role of locomotor abilities in sexual selection is less well documented, but is probably of wide importance. Sexual selection may exaggerate traits beyond their optimum with respect to biomechanical or physiological function, thus imposing ‘costs’ of various types. Locomotor performance, in conjunction with its lower‐level determinants and its behavioural and ecological consequences, constitutes an ideal set of phenotypes with which to study such costs. Organisms may possess traits that compensate for the negative effects of sexually selected traits on performance abilities. Ignoring these may lead to erroneous conclusions about the cost of a putatively sexually selected trait. At the same time, ignoring the effects of sexual selection on functionally important traits may lead us to underestimate their functional significance. Many properties of organisms are affected by, or at least correlate with, overall body size, so this must be considered in any study of adaptation or sexual selection. For interspecific or interpopulation comparative studies, phylogeny must also be considered in statistical analyses. We present a hypothetical data set that illustrates the perils of ignoring potential compensatory mechanisms when studying the costs of a sexually selected trait. We also discuss different ways of studying costs, including analyses of a single sex and of the differences between the sexes.",

      "abstract": "When we ask what causes people to commit crimes, there are always two important factors: the dispositional and situational determinants of anti-social behavior, Each hum an being is a biological organism Jiving in a social con text, and thus this behavier is always the joint outcome of hereditary and environmental influences.\r\n When we speak of hereditary factors playing a role in anti-social behavior, it is always understood that such factors alone do not cause deviant actions, but, rather, that :they increase the likelihood of such actions taking place under certain environmental conditions.\r\n Possible causes of aberrations are gene mutation, radiation, nondisjunction, drugs, viruses and geographic and possibly economic factors (Grossman, 1973)\r\n Chromosomal abnormality provides an interesting case of the possibility of a close relationship between heredity and personality. There is a higher than normal frequency. of abnormal chromosomal combinations among criminals. That is, instead of the normal female xx chromosome or the normal male xy chromosome there are supernumerary y’s such as xyy, xy yy, or xxx, of course, xyy / xyyy, xy /xyy Or xI/xyy and xo/xyy occur.\r\n Adult male prisoners who have the xyy chromosome are unusually tall, are below normal in intelligence, and. have had excessive acne during adolescence. But an abnormal chromosome does not make a criminal-some who are not criminal have the abnormal chromosome and vice versa (Moritagn. 1968)\r\n The resort to brawn rather than brain is not limited to individuals endowed with an extra y chromosome. Most violent crimes arecommitted by chromosomally normal individuals However, the high frequency with which individuals with xyy chromosomes commit crimes of violence leaves little doubt that in some cases the additional y chromo¬some exerts a preponderantly powerful influence in the genesis of oppressive behavior, (Montagu, A., 1968)\r\n Although we are in no positron to control, the genetic inheritance of an individual, we can do a great deal to change certain environmental conditions that may encourage the xyy individual to commit criminal acts.\r\n A society does not properly acquit itself of its responsibilities if it places the entire burden of caring for abnormal individual upon the parent. What we are talking about here is not a program of engenic control, but a program of social therapy.\r\n The discovery of chromosomal abnormalityas being related to criminal tendencies is fortunate if society is warned to provide an especially healthful environment for the unfortunates-but then such should be the birthright of all children.",

      "title": "Early Life and the Development of Resilience",
      "abstract": "Can J Psychiatry. 2011;56(8):445-446. Resilience involves resistance to the negative effects of tragic loss, serious failure or insult, or disturbance of the available social frame. Such experiences may be brought on by loss of valued relationships, abilities or functional level, or sources of support, and is likely to be reflected in symptomatic increase in mental disorder. Thus resilience as an issue is critical at one time or another in a probable large majority of human lives; it refers to the ability to cope with life's nontrivially difficult or unpleasant tasks, situations, or experiences with attitudes and actions that minimize or overcome their negative effects. Such coping involves strategies that include reasonable evaluation of the situation, weighing alternative actions, mechanisms of self-control and confidence, obtaining interpersonal comfort and collaboration, and other help seeking. Abilities to employ such strategies vary among individuals, as does the sensitivity to different kinds of negative experiences. Although these differences are likely influenced by genetic variation, social interactions that shape their development begin in the immediate postnatal period,' when the neonate seeks comfort, warmth, and nourishment. Neonatal offspring of depressed mothers are less responsive to social stimuli2 and biological indicators of these early behaviours1 may be early signs of nonresilient patterns of processing social-behavioural options. In the pre-school period, and increasingly thereafter, children need to understand the origins of their own emotional reactions to positive and negative experiences, as well as those of their peers.4 This understanding will arise from frequent and positive interaction with parents, siblings, and (or) other caretakers, and, normatively, will develop into skills for communicating appropriately with peers. Such understanding and skills may well serve as a basis for resilience in the face of a range of problematic experiences, peers, or negative environments. The papers in this section5,6 provide evidence regarding environmental and developmental processes in later childhood that may promote such resilience. In the first paper, by Dr Jeffrey G Johnson and colleagues,5 substantial and positive parenting during the developmental years, by either or both parents in a general population sample, is shown to be related to a much lower rate not only of the DSM Axis I disorders into young adulthood but also of the personality disorders, which themselves indicate problems in likely resilience skills. The second study, by Dr Stephanie D Stepp and colleagues,6 shows that social competence among inner-city boys as they begin adolescence serves as a protection over time to ongoing exposure to the problematic behaviour and minimized academic efforts that characterize many of their peers in low-income neighbourhoods. Again, this study6 suggests the importance of early training in the understanding of the emotional reactions of peers, as well as one's own, and reinforcement of constructive responses both to peer and to adult expectations. It is likely that these relatively resilient children may also have experienced more positive parenting than those in the same study who failed to show resilient outcomes, but such data were not part of these analyses. …",

An adapted life story interview was conducted with seven participants between the ages of 20 and 47 years. Life stories were analysed using content analysis. \r\nThe study found that non-masculinity was defined in different ways and that social context, including threat, impacted on gender expression. Non-masculinity was strongly associated with male homosexuality. Homophobic verbal and physical abuse was portrayed alongside negative appraisals of non-masculinity. This may be indicative of internalised anti-effeminacy values.\r\nMarginalisation in gay communities was also portrayed, including romantic rejection. Intersections of gender-expression and ethnicity or age were important in evaluations of sexual attractiveness. Conversely, masculinity was often eroticised or regarded as aspirational. Positive qualities associated with non-masculinity included expressiveness, humour and flexibility in working with power demonstrations of others. These reinforce the assertion that effeminate and androgynous men bypass facets of gender-role conflict.",

Additionally, the roles of masculinity and physical body traits (e.g., penis size, muscularity, height, hairiness, and weight) were tested as correlates of anal penetrative identity and identity-behavior concordance. Tops and bottoms showed a high degree of concordance between identity and enacted behavior; however, only half of versatiles reported concordant identity and behavior (i.e., wanting to be versatile and actually reporting versatile behavior). Generally, tops reported larger penises than bottoms. They also reported being comparatively more masculine than bottoms. Versatiles fell somewhat between the tops and bottoms on these traits. Of the six independent variables, penis size and masculinity were the only two factors to influence concordance or discordance between identity and penetrative behavior. Our study suggests that the correlates of gay men’s sexual self-labels may depend on objective traits in addition to the subjective pleasure associated with receptive or insertive anal intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;",

The empirical data consist of 15 interviews with women who have been subjected to incest by their biological fathers or stepfathers.The study provides an alternative kind of understanding of incest. The chosen perspective has made possible an understanding of incest as process, where sexual abuse does not consist of isolated events but is part of continuous incestuous process. In this process, of informants becomes that of victim. The perpetrators are categorized as the tyrants and the janus faces. The sexual abuse was experienced by some of informants in such painful way that they had to situation. Since they, because of their subordinate position, cannot take their bodies with them, they leave in psychological sense. Using terminology of symbolic interactionism, I disappears while me remains. A result of this is that no interaction, role-taking nor definition of situation is possible. This means that black holes and lapses of memory occur in victims´ trajactories. The role of victim becomes a bridge of identity which carries over black holes. This study has also served to further develop concepts within field of symbolic interactionism. Some concepts have been defined and used in somewhat different way than usual; e.g. by way of linking them to gender- and power relations.",

This central role of sexuality in a person's life is affected by health or illness and by many psychologic factors.

Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited.

      "abstract": "Peoples sexuality and contraceptive needs are examined at 2 important periods of life -- adolescence and middle age. Human sexuality as much psychological as it is physical involves the mind and the body. Contraceptive and sexuality must be linked. When choosing methods of contraception couples must consider the facts and select what appeals to them in view of their needs fertility moral or religious habits and their cultural and individual attitudes towards sexual relationships and male and female roles. Another important principle is that the contraceptive needs of a person will vary throughout his/her life. With physical and psychological maturity occurring progressively earlier and the age of marriage becoming later it is inevitable that an increasing number of adolescents experiment with sex or have sexual relations outside marriage. The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) implies a premeditated intention to be sexually involved which many young women do not have as well as the ability and motivation to take pills regularly. The insertion of an IUD reduces the problem of poor motivation but the complication rates tend to be increased in young nulliparae which requires followup visits. 1 problem with the diaphragm is that nulliparous teenagers frequently find the procedure of fitting a diaphragm rather offputting. It also requires preparation for each act of intercourse. Condoms appear particularly suitable for unmarried teenagers because their use does not require any preparation or long-term planning and they are available from many retail outlets. Postcoital contraception is of use after a single episode of unprotected midcycle intercourse. The sexual potential of the human female is at its greatest between the ages of 35-45. By the time women reach the 40-45 year age group the fertility rate drops by more than 1/2. Barrier methods which are related specifically to each act of intercourse are particularly suitable for the older couple. The IUD requires no daily motivation and gives an overall failure rate of 3-5 pregnancies/100 women years. This is lower among older women. Many older women who have completed their families and want to stop taking the OC seek sterilization as the best method of fertility control.",

      "abstract": "Homosexuality, or inversion, is defined by medical discourses since the middle of the XIXth century, as a condition which radically marks individuals so labelled. Through those discourses, a figure, a character, is built. It is no longer precise sexual acts which are at stake, but the totality of the person, who has salient features, biological, psychological as well as behavioral. Those salient features are built on gender mixing, even on sexual characteristics mixing. The inverts, in such a definition, stress the bipolarity of sexes because they embody an intermediate state, the 'third sex'. But this conceptualisation implies also a reinforcement of the two poles of categorisation. Homosexuals do not follow 'the natural law' which defines men and women. Third part excluded from bicategorisation, indifferentiate freaks, those characters are analysers for social definitions of sexes, genders and their evolution.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Adolescent and adult cross-dressing or “transvestism” is the most common antecedent behavioral pattern among those who request sex reassignment surgery. Transvestites are actually a diverse group of men who differ in their gender identities, orientation, and intention. They do, however, have in common a soothing image of themselves as women. Because of this, whether cross-dressing occurs among masculine or feminine males or heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, or asexuals, or among those with paraphilia, the behavior should be considered the expression of their consciously felt femininity. The confusing differences among cross-dressing males may be explained by their diversity along three dimensions: 1) the ambition for heterosexual intercourse; 2) the natural history of their sexual arousal to female clothing; 3) their current capacity to integrate their masculine and feminine strivings into separate compartments. When cross-dressers give up all vestiges of male gender role behaviors and successfully live and work full time as women, the appropriate descriptive term for them becomes “transsexual.”",

The most commonly reported positive sentiment was by far interest/curiosity. Negative emotions were much more varied, but anxiety was the most common. Only about a third of participants selected disgust or repugnance as something they felt, and an even smaller portion had this emotion come to mind prior to seeing a list of options.Participants felt primarily interested and anxious about human reproductive cloning. They did not primarily feel disgust or repugnance. This provides initial empirical evidence that such a reaction is not appropriately widespread.",

Women's preferences for sexually dimorphic characteristics in male faces (facial masculinity) have recently been reported to covary with self-reported attractiveness. As women's attractiveness has been proposed to signal reproductive condition, the findings in human (Homo sapiens) and other species may reflect similar processes. The current study investigated whether the covariation between condition and preferences for masculinity would generalize to 2 further measures of female attractiveness: other-rated facial attractiveness and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Women with high (unattractive) WHR and/or relatively low other-rated facial attractiveness preferred more \"feminine\" male faces when choosing faces for a long-term relationship than when choosing for a short-term relationship, possibly reflecting diverse tactics in female mate choice.",

Physically mature 12-year-old girls may have to cope with confusing sexual feelings and experiences for which they privately feel emotionally unready, despite their apparent outward sophistication. Small 14-year-old boys who are late developers suffer agonies wondering if their bodies will ever change into those of men. The sense of being unable to control the body's physical destiny can bring enormous anxiety, frustration, anger, and distress, as acne takes a hold or breasts become too obvious a feature on a shy girl's body. This is the age of puberty, which can be protracted or rapid, during which young adolescents reach sexual maturity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disclosure: X. Xu: None. Y. Lin: None. B. Shivanna: None. A. Lee: None. J.C. Hakim: None. D.G. Mann: None. L.M. Noll: None. P. Georgiadis: None. S.K. Gunn: None. L.P. Karaviti: None. Background: Our case provides the identification and management of a newborn baby with ovotesticular syndrome, which was formerly known as true hermaphroditism. The term was classically derived from Greek mythology in which the deity 'Hermaphroditus', merging with the nymph Salamis, embodied both male and female attributes. The term 'true hermaphroditism' is now avoided due to its stigmatizing connotations. Ovotesticular difference of sex development (DSD) is an exceedingly rare condition, occurring in fewer than 1 in 20,000 births. This condition involves the coexistence of functional ovarian and testicular tissue within one individual, presenting a challenge in sex assignment due to unpredictable gender development. Clinical Case: This is a single case of the presence of ovarian and testicular differentiation on one side and a transitional zone of mixed pattern. Prenatal genetic testing consistent 46,XX karyotype. Initial ultrasound at the outside hospital revealed a uterus and right testicle. The baby exhibited Prader stage 4 genitalia, with a palpable gonad in the right labioscrotal area and the left gonad not palpable. Prophylactic hydrocortisone was started due to concerns regarding NR5A1/SF1 mutation. Further evaluations, including genetic tests, hormonal assessments, urinalysis and kidney ultrasound for the WT1 mutation, and scrotal and pelvic ultrasounds, were conducted. The high-dose ACTH stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency. The testosterone level was in the male range, and the HCG stimulation test further confirmed functioning Leydig cells. The postnatal karyotype was 46,XX, and chromosome microarray analysis showed no abnormalities. Our approach to this case was multidisciplinary, including our endocrine experts, urologist, gynecologist, ethicist, and psychologist. We discussed the fluidity of sex assignment and addressed the degree of virilization, nature of the gonadal tissue, and emphasized the necessity of regular clinical follow-up. Our main concern was to educate the parents and protect the choices of the child. In this case, the child assumed a male sex assignment, as a result of the decision-making process between our team and the parents. In this context we did emphasize the fluidity of sex assignment. Clinical Lesson: Long-term outcomes for ovotesticular DSD remain understudied. Existing reports highlight varying rates of gender dysphoria, sexual function, and psychological well-being. Our approach to managing ovotesticular DSD involved a framework emphasizing ethical considerations and parental involvement. We advocated for and practiced a shared decision-making model involving healthcare providers, parents, and ultimately the patient. Presentation: 6/3/2024",

      "abstract": "Turner's syndrome and variations of Turner's syndrome including “mixed” gonadal dysgcnesis may be viewed as members of a single group of disorders, the gonadal dysgeneses. Seven patients are described whose various clinical and cytogenetic features make them represcntative of the many individuals with one of the gonadal dysgeneses reported from other clinics. The developmental abnormalities which occur, including dysgenetic gonadal tissue, may be traced to the presence during embryonic life of a monosomic (45, X) or a genetically deficient (e.g., 46, XXqi) cell line, whereas a degree of normal gonadal development in some individuals may he traced to the presence also of normal female or male cells. A unifying explanation for these disorders is presented in terms of a single erroneous chromosomal event occurring after fertilization. Such an event may well be an intrachromosomal rearrangement affecting either an X or a Y, from which may derive a cell line containing a structurally abnormal sex chromosome, a monosomic cell line, or both. The preponderance of affected individuals showing non‐mosaic monosomy (45, X), or the mosaic combination of monosomic cells with cells having a structurally rearranged X or Y chromosome, points to the zygote as the cell in which the disruptive event occurs most often. The less frequent co‐existence of normal diploid cells with abnormal (monosomic or deficient) cells indicates that the disruptive event sometimes occurs in an early postzygotic cell.",

      "abstract": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) or simply endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) refer to any substance which may mimic or interfere with the normal functions of the endocrine system. They are found in everyday products like plastic bottles and containers, liners of metal food cans, detergents, flame retardants, food, toys, cosmetics, pesticides, and virtually every available human consumables. Due to the fact that most of them are slow in degradation or even completely non- biodegradable, they constitute great risk to the ecosystem. It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this current review therefore is to identify and peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDCs on adult male and female fertility during the critical preconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. Finally, it will highlight future research focus as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity.",

Our research aimed at complex recognition of sexual functioning, usual behaviour in all revealing spheres, normal aspects: dreams, imagining, masturbation, foreplay, coitus and sexual attitudes. 200 persons were sample in this research: 100 alcohol addicts and 100 persons of the control group. Following results were obtained: • dreams of sexual contents are rare both with addicts and other population, but significantly larger percent of alcoholics has “wet or orgasmic” dreams, • day-dreaming is less noticed with alcoholics, meaning that the need for raising sexual vigilance is reduced, • alcoholics masturbate more, they start to masturbate in later stage, • addicts rarely have foreplay and its duration is shorter, as a consequence of disturbed intimacy and impossibility of total harmony and exchange with a partner, • alcoholics have less sexual intercourses and feel different during them • there are no great differences in opinions about sex, • structural personal characteristics also have effect on sexual behaviour and alcoholism. Alcoholics have certain personal characteristics that clearly define them and which, because of their nature, influence addiction development and sexual behaviour. We can conclude from the research that a tendency in behaviour is evidenced, and for which can be said that it is \"pattern of sexual functioning of alcoholics\". Except difficulties in genital response, \"pattern\" refers to emotional component, meaning closeness or a level of intimacy with partner, as well as modification of \"normal” sexual aspects.",

      "title": "Third Gender Politics: Hijra Identity Construction in India and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Indian law has only recently stopped criminalizing what was perceived as deviant homosexual behavior and started extending full citizenship rights to its queer populace. The government’s attempts to regulate sexual behavior was often steeped in antiquated Orientalist colonial practices that rendered non-binary subjects voiceless. Indian youth who identify as hijras, a third gender who are usually born male but present as female, often experience alienation and stigmatization both at home and in diaspora. This leads to what I call ideological diaspora – internal diaspora founded in cultural and physical exile even at home. Systematic marginalization makes hijras subaltern subjects, which affects the lives of diasporic youth trying to create dialogic identities. While hijras are usually either absent or objects of ridicule in Western media portrayals, looking at rather than through the third-gender subject is one way to allow the assertion of identity. This may take place through sensitive portrayals of hijras in film and novels, or through publications and autobiographic texts that allow for complex narratives and voice. Third-gender youth growing up in ideological and/or literal diaspora need these representations to feel a sense of community and move from being seen as Other to “another.”",

      "abstract": "In the 21st century, men is expressing the femininity instead of the muscularity. And a boundary line between a man and a woman is not clear any more. A man is interested in the lifestyle of a woman, and he imitates her fashion styles, hairstyles, accessories, make-up, and plastic surgery. He is called as Metrosexual or Crossexual. Nowadays, men as well as women can satisfy the wants for beauty. The beautiful appearance of a man has a good impact on the social relationships. The feminizing trends are generally accepted and are shown in the silhouettes, details, colors, fabrics and accessories. The feminizing trends in men's knitwear are shown in the various items. They have slim silhouettes and feminine details. Also they are made of bulky yarns or fancy yarns, and various stitches for texture effects. The most outstanding changes in men's knitwear are the vivid colors and flower patterns.",

      "abstract": "This paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis on sexual orientation identity development milestones among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another sexual minority identity (LGB+). Common milestones measured in the 30 studies reviewed were becoming aware of queer attractions, questioning one’s sexual orientation, self-identifying as LGB+, coming out to others, engaging in sexual activity, and initiating a romantic relationship. Milestones occurred in different sequences, although attraction was almost always first, often followed by self-identification and/or sexual activity; coming out and initiating a romantic relationship often followed these milestones. Meta-analysis results showed that the mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals varied by milestone: attraction [ M age =12.7 (10.1, 15.3)], questioning one’s orientation [ M age =13.2 [12.8, 13.6]), self-identifying [ M age =17.8 (11.6, 24.0)], sexual activity [ M age =18.1 (17.6, 18.6)], coming out [ M age =19.6 (17.2, 22.0)], and romantic relationship [ M age =20.9 (13.2, 28.6)]. Nonetheless, results also showed substantial heterogeneity in the mean effect sizes. Additional meta-analyses showed that milestone timing varied by sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort. Although patterns were found in LGB+ identity development, there was considerable diversity in milestone trajectories.",

      "title": "“The perfunctory vagina”: exploring the experiential discourses of sexuality and self-regulatory performances to invoke the appearance of ‘well-being’ with Karen, a mental health service user",
      "abstract": "“When you’re married well people suppose you want to do it and I don’t and I never have really. It must be like shagging a bag of potatoes really and I can’t even see what he gets out of it”. Here Karen, a 53 year old mental health service user, talks about her emotional and bodily indifference to vaginal penetration in terms of sexual relations with her husband. From a prima facie perspective, we are presented with the dominant cultural discourses of heterosexual marital rights and one woman’s lack of sexual desire, or frigidity. Nevertheless, Karen’s narratives are more complex than this and weave between the self-regulation of outward appearance to avoid the familial ‘gaze’ of certain behaviours imbued within her diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder and the submissive, ritualised bodily performance of allowing unwanted sexual intercourse to occur. Compliancy within the hegemonic parameters of sexuality and appearance however afford Karen to seek her own ways of achieving sexual satisfaction namely, in her secret acts of self-harming. In this way, her vagina functions as an apparatus to both stabilise her physical and emotional position of well-being as well as mediating her subversive hidden pleasures.",

This complex psychical process explores, among other things, the quality of the father’s gaze which follows the evolution of the organization of genital sexuality in his adolescent daughter. This work deals with a rather neglected aspect of the relation between daughter and father. In the analytic treatment of adolescents weak fathers, absent or even violent,can often be the object of huge protective movements and positive judgments on the part of their daughters, who’ll do anything to place the paternal image on a pedestal. In these cases, the Œdipal father seems to have to be kept alive and promoted in order to fulfil his function sufficiently. Indeed, it is only under such conditions that the parricidal fantasy may be fully recognized, its symbolic value fully elaborated, and the Œdipal father can disappear over the horizon.",

      "abstract": "n every society there are some acts considered beyond the pale.They are deemed so inherently harmful that they must be criminalized with severe sanctions. 1Such acts typically include violent deeds like murder, torture, and sexual assault.These core offences are held to have \"manifest criminality\" 2 ; they are so wrong that it seems absurd to consider the moral legitimacy or practical merits of their prohibition.The legitimacy and/or efficiacy of their criminalization is not a matter up for debate.Imagine if someone argued that the act of killing another human should be decriminalized because it unduly restricts the freedom of murderers or because it is too difficult or expensive to enforce or because it does not successfully deter future killings.Most of us would consider such a claim morally repugnant, not worthy of serious consideration.Illicit-drug trafficking (that is, the production, transport, wholesale, and retail sale of psychoactive substances such as cannabis, opiates, coca, and amphetamines) 3 is often considered to be one of these core criminal offences.The seri-* B.A. (Laurentian), LL.B.

It can be used more loosely to denote sexualities that differ from heterosexual normativity. The action of coming out is not a singular event but an ongoing process that happens throughout one's life. The revealing of sexuality does not need to be done in a uniform or linear way and involves a spectrum of choices about how much to disclose, to which people, and in what contexts. The act of coming out is of personal and also political significance. On a personal level it can signify a need to be true to oneself as well as to brave external judgement. Politically, it represents the importance of acknowledging the need to convey difference as a collective action.",

During puberty, the body grows to reach adult stature and physical maturation, the reproductive organs mature to become fully functional in producing mature ova and spermatozoa, and psychological changes occur related to both reproductive ability and body growth. Development of the secondary sexual characteristics, rapid skeletal growth to final adult stature, and changes in both lean body mass and fat distribution all occur. These must be precisely controlled and co-ordinated.",

In industrial and postindustrial societies this passage depends less and less on the onset of old age and all that this entails-less physically able, a reduced intellectual capacity, and is increasingly linked to an economic and social value attributed to the individual on the basis of a change in occupational status following retirement. This change is usually classified according to outdated rules, which are no longer acceptable, so that the age at which one ‘s working life ends can often coincide with a stage when the individual concerned is by no means old (Livi Bacci, 1987; Egidi, 1990).",

      "title": "The human-animal relationship in higher scientific education and its ethical implications",
      "abstract": "Biology and animal production manuals have in common to tackle animals from an instrumental viewpoint and to exclude the ethical issues raised by the use of animals (for experimentation or production). A study conducted in our university reveals that the students’ representation of animals consists in assuming that the more an animal is perceived as “intelligent” (which is related to its symbolic representation), the more concern has to be granted to its suffering. Most of scientific manuals refer to animals as valid models of humans’ emotional processes (i.e. stress, anxiety, depression). However, little or nothing is said about animal suffering and ethical issues of animal experimentation. Moreover, some French animal production manuals deal with welfare or with animal’s emotions, but as above, animal ethics remains considered under an instrumental standpoint. The lack of training in ethics contributes to settle-down such pre-formed representations. Moreover, procedures involving animals are often transmitted as a set of “customs” and “habits” conditioning the integration of young professional. This takes to consider ethics as superfluous external constraints to which “experts” have to submit to meet the “naïve” demands of public. In conclusion, we point out our own difficulties as scientists to construct another relationship with animals, and about the interest of including these difficulties into educational practices.",

Bisexual men are less likely to disclose, and more likely to conceal (i.e., a desire to hide), their sexual orientation than gay men. Theory suggests that this may adversely impact their mental health. This report examined the factors associated with disclosure and with concealment of sexual orientation, the association of disclosure and concealment with mental health, and the potential mediators (i.e., internalized homophobia, social support) of this association with mental health.An ethnically diverse sample of 203 non-gay-identified, behaviorally bisexual men who do not disclose their same-sex behavior to their female partners were recruited in New York City to complete a single set of self-report measures.Concealment was associated with higher income, a heterosexual identification, living with a wife or girlfriend, more frequent sex with women, and less frequent sex with men. Greater concealment, but not disclosure to friends and family, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that both internalized homophobia and general emotional support significantly mediated the association between concealment and mental health.The findings demonstrate that concealment and disclosure are independent constructs among bisexual men. Further, they suggest that interventions addressing concerns about concealment, emotional support, and internalized homophobia may be more beneficial for increasing the mental health of bisexual men than those focused on promoting disclosure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This is the first of three chapters that consider paradigms of rape under which nonconsent is presumed on the basis of certain kinds of background conditions. The particular focus here is on cases in which complainants are said to lack the capacity to consent. Persons who are asleep, unconscious, or in a persistent vegetative state can be categorically and uniformly held to be incapable of consenting, without much risk of overinclusiveness. But the situation presented by persons suffering from intellectual or communicative deficits or who are intoxicated is more variegated and complex. There is a danger that if incapacity in these spheres is defined too broadly, some people who suffer from mental disabilities or who drink for the purpose of making themselves less inhibited might be denied the opportunity to have genuinely consensual sex.",

      "title": "Why is absent/low sexual desire a mental disorder (except when patients identify as asexual)?",
      "abstract": "This analytic essay challenges the psychiatric practice of treating absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal as a mental disorder. It does so by calling attention to the fact that asexuality is treated differently than other non-heterosexual orientations. The current DSM contains no psychiatric diagnosis which has, as its primary symptom, same-sex sexual desire. Yet, the same DSM offers diagnoses such as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual interest/arousal disorder which have, as their primary symptom, absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal. One of the unfortunate consequences of treating absent/low sexual desire as a mental disorder is that it perpetuates the false belief that those who experience their sexuality differently than the heterosexual ‘sexusociety’ norm are less healthy and more dysfunctional. It is also troubling because of the implied gender bias: women are more likely to experience absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal than men and more likely to be diagnosed with a sexual interest/desire/arousal disorder. Women’s sexual desires, or the absence thereof, are, thus, more likely to be seen as abnormal. Since that judgment has long been used to pressure women to engage in sex they do not want, the unavoidable inference is that the psychiatric tradition of diagnosing absent/low sexual desire as pathological has placed, and continues to place, women at greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. The remedy: stop treating absent/low sexual desire as pathological. Recognize that people are sexually different and are entitled to desire sex a lot, a little, or not at all—whatever feels right for them.",

      "abstract": "The question of the role of prenatal sex hormones in human psychosexual differentiation originated in the clinical context of intersexuality and its management problems. Sex hormones affect the size of certain cell clusters, shapes of dendritic trees, and types of synapses; such sex-dimorphic structures have been localized in several areas of the brain, particularly in the hypothalamus and the preoptic area. The use of sex hormones in the treatment of problem pregnancies was first introduced in the 1940s, after it had become known that successful initiation as well as maintenance of pregnancy depended, on hormones produced by the mother as well as by the feto-placental unit. Thus, the available observations suggest that prenatal sex hormones contribute to the development of behavioral differences between the sexes in general as it has been demonstrated in animal research. The tendencies are likely to facilitate or inhibit certain behavior effects of the sex-typing pressures that the developing individual encounters in the social environment.",

The data analysed here consist of anonymous responses to a questionnaire on sexual behaviour and attitudes obtained from a large community-based sample of Australian male twins aged 18-52. Significant heritabilities were observed for a range of psychological and behavioural measures (orientation of present sexual feelings and fantasies, ever having been sexually attracted to a man, attitude to homosexual sex, number of male and female sexual partners), with approximately 42 to 60 per cent of observed variance estimated to be due to genetic influences in these variables. Familial aggregation was also observed in other measures (sexual behaviour in the past twelve months, attitude to heterosexual sex) but it was not possible to determine whether this was due to genetic or shared environmental influences.",

      "title": "Overview of infertility",
      "abstract": "Having a child is an innate trait in animals, including humans, and is required for the continued existence of all animal species. Therefore, for most women, the inability to conceive or to do so in a timely fashion - termed infertility - to enable the continuation of the family line can be emotionally distressing. The definition of infertility is controversial because of its separation into primary and secondary. This is further complicated by the loosely used term subfertility, which relates to couples who have reduced ability because they take longer than the natural time to conceive, as opposed to those who are infertile and are entirely unable to conceive after 6 to 12 months, depending on age. Infertility evaluation requires a thorough male and female history, physical examination of both partners, and targeted investigation to determine the cause of infertility in a particular couple. Various treatments apply to infertile couples depending on the age of the female partner, the results of investigations, the reason for infertility, the presence of inheritance of abnormal genes, the pregnancy rates the couple is happy with, the resources available, how desperate the couple is to achieve a live birth, and how much they want to commit to treatment. Infertility treatment could include counseling and expectant management only, intrauterine insemination in a natural or stimulated cycle, and IVF and or ICSI. Men with azoospermia will need surgical options to retrieve sperm for IVF/ ICSI, but rarely for IUI. This review overviews infertility's etiology, diagnosis, investigations, and treatment.",

These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

Il loro bisogno di nascondersi viene rinforzato dall’umiliazione pubblica traumatizzante che fa seguito sia all’espressione aperta del loro desiderio omosessuale, che dei loro comportamenti non conformi alle aspettative di genere. L’esperienza di essere scoperti, puniti e umiliati per aver mostrato o per aver agito tali sentimenti o comportamenti puo portare allo sviluppo di attivita finalizzate al nascondimento, che persistono a lungo anche dopo che il trauma reale e stato dimenticato. Quando le espressioni aperte di intimita nei confronti di una persona dello stesso sesso vengono tenute cosi nascoste, le attivita sessuali clandestine e proibite, pesantemente tinte da uno stato di angoscia interpersonale, possono divenire una modalita relazionale significativa per la persona.

      "title": "Pornography and Erotica",
      "abstract": "The terms “pornography” and “erotica” are often defined in opposition to each other. As a minimal definition both refer to mediated communication that depicts sexually explicit subject matter, but beyond that the two terms part company in a variety of ways. “Erotica” was coined in the 1950s to designate something more elevated and exclusive than pornography. Social scientists have drawn up typologies for categorizing sexually explicit material. These usually oppose the “ideal” character of erotica, in which no power relations are discerned, with the degrading and sexist nature of “standard” or “violent” pornography. Today the term “erotica” is often used in reference to material produced by and for women as opposed to (male) pornography. There are also a range of distinctions made in terms of intentions and outcomes; pornography is designed to sexually arouse the producer and/or audience, whereas erotica is whatever the individual finds arousing; pornography induces a purely sexual response, whereas erotica combines sexual with emotional and aesthetic responses; pornography stimulates solitary masturbation whereas erotica provides an aphrodisiac for interpersonal sex. Another approach is to see the category of pornography as a function of censorship: that to which the social elite restrict access by means of administrative or legal exclusion. Here we must introduce another important distinction: that between “hard core” and “soft core.” What must be excluded is the pornographic hard core – namely, whatever is left once erotic material with any artistic or scientific value has been redeemed. Another way of drawing the distinction between soft core and hard core is to class the former as the creative representation of sexual subject matter, using literary, graphic, photographic and filmic techniques; and the latter, as the direct documentation of sexual acts, which by definition is confined to photography and especially to the moving image. There is, in short, no universally accepted way of defining either term.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are various ways of classifying sexual desire, and even more ways of attempting to measure it. Intrapsychically it is manifest by a sensitivity to sexual stimuli, preoccupation with sexual fantasies, and/or a longing to be with the preferred partner. Physiologically there is a lowered threshold for genital engorgement which may only be relieved by orgasm. The relation between physical and psychological changes is complex, which prevents one making any clear assessments of the libido from physical arousal. Certainly the physical and psychological changes react with each other in the manner of a feedback loop, the feeling of genital engorgement leading to psychic arousal and vice versa. There are several difficulties in assessing sexual desire.",

      "title": "Defective Social Intelligence as a Factor in Crime",
      "abstract": "STUDIES OF causal factors in criminal behavior have multiplied rapidly in the last half century. We cannot review the major or the more recent of these studies. Suffice it to say that many of them have suffered from a too heterogeneous selection of cases. The endless complexities entering into the behavior patterns of varied age groups, of varied nationalities, of varied cultures, of different stages of criminal behavior, almost preclude scientific findings. A second serious limitation is that the different determinants of criminal behavior almost invariably have been studied as unitary, e.g., such factors as lack of home restraint, or urban conditions of life, or the thwarting of the social wishes, or emotional imbalance, have been listed with little or no reference to the cultural world nor to the changes in the role of personality which influence the behavior pattern. This situation does not mean that students of criminology do not fully appreciate the intricate complexities of criminal behavior. There is considerable intellectual appreciation and much profound academic discussion, but there has been little actual collection and use of facts on a large scale under controlled conditions. The obstacles encountered in studies of closely interrelated multiple factors, viewed as a Gestalt, even of a more or less homogeneous group of offenders, are numerous and complex. The writer, therefore, offers the following preliminary study in a series of other studies of adult offenders, with considerable hesitancy. Two thousand consecutive probation records of men who had applied for probation at the Los Angeles County Probation Department during I933 were taken for study.' These records revealed the following facts: 57 percent were under 30 years of age; 75 percent were native-born; 86 percent were non-transients; 59 percent were reared by both parents and 83 percent were reared at home by one or both parents; 45 percent had completed at least grammar school and 63 percent had more than eighth but less than twelfth grade education; 65 percent were Protestants; go percent were of normal intelligence; 95 percent were in good health at the time of arrest; 56 percent had committed crimes against property, that is, they were charged with burglary, robbery, grand larceny, auto theft, forgery, and embezzlement. Ninety percent admitted the use of intoxicants, and 30 percent admitted the use of alcohol to excess; only 2 percent admitted the use of drugs.",

However, an alternative approach might also be useful-the point of view of the women themselves, as they go through the experience of learning, assuming, practicing, and discarding roles and functions. I would like to explore the possibility of revealing such functions through a look at the life cycle of women, particularly those transitional points in the life cycle that become recognized, culturally defined crises. Life crises may be taken to mean those periods in the life span at which there is some interruption in continuity-a transition from one culturally defined stage of life to another, and at which there is regularly expected individual stress. Such crises are frequently but not necessarily ritualized; they may coincide with but are not the same as rites de passage.",

In some cultures, these individuals identify as (trans) women. Many of these individuals undergo medical treatments to feminize their bodies (e.g., breast augmentation), but most do not undergo vaginoplasties and therefore have penises. In many non-Western cultures, feminine trans individuals identify as a non-binary gender (i.e., neither man, nor woman). Many of these individuals do not surgically augment their bodies. Across cultures, some men express sexual interest in feminine trans individuals. Are manifestations of sexual interest in feminine trans individuals consistent across Western and non-Western cultural settings? Our review suggests that, across cultures, most of these men are also sexually attracted to cisgender individuals. Many are sexually attracted to cisgender women or to cisgender members of both sexes. A small subset is sexually attracted to cisgender men. Men who are sexually interested in feminine trans individuals commonly report being primarily insertive during anal sex. Additionally, they tend to report that their sexual interest in these individuals is motivated by attraction to femininity or to the combination female- and male-typical characteristics.",

The Gabonese woman, generally resorts to the etiology of witchcraft to order to justify, on one hand, illegal abortion, often presented as an involuntary supernatural and malefic fact, when the latter is known to those around her and, on the other hand, to explain some secondary sterility that has resulted from unsafe abortions. The purpose of this work is to examine, in the case of <i>Mufune</i>, the archaic level of the psychic investment of the fetus or the embryo as an imaginary object in utero, articulated with the discourse of family persecution because of the difficulties inherent in reproduction for a woman. Abortion, even unsecured, thus refers to feelings and the lived experience of women all of which are part of a specific psychic space. The latter is born with the joint emergence of the desire to have a child, the desire of pregnancy and the desire for maternity which take shape at the moment when the question of the continuation or not of the pregnancy arises, and is instituted with the act of abortion together with all of the psychic effects.",

They received information about a male or female, heterosexual or homosexual applicant (randomly assigned).

As for the object referred to in Article 156 which becomes the object of the offense is a person or ethnicity, ethnicity or population group. The research method used is normative research. The results of the study show that in the case of the statement where the genie disposes of the child, even though the words are demeaning, the statement cannot be applied as an offense against a tribe, race or class, because the statement is addressed to a region or region not to a particular community.

Esto puede representar una autorizacion para desplazarse fuera del mundo de las mujeres, o un deseo de crear una familia y tener hijos.

It is a social construct – an ideal image of manhood that is culturally specific and historically variable, but is generally situated in relation to, and characterized by, an absence of femininity. Central to sociological discussions of masculinity is the theorization of men's power, and how this is asserted, enacted against, or obtained at the expense of women, other men, and people of all genders. Accordingly, the study of masculinity is a key component of social research that aims to explain and tackle, among other things, gendered family violence, unequal divisions of labor, gendered workplace outcomes in pay and status, homophobia, and the physical and mental health effects of men's valorization of toughness, stoicism, heterosexism, (economic) self‐sufficiency, and constrained emotionality. Understanding how masculinity changes over time is also a key ambition for sociologists.",

      "abstract": "Development does not take place in isolation; close others form an important dyad for exploring interrelationships. To examine spousal interrelations in level and change of cognitive functioning in old age, the authors applied dynamic models to 11-year longitudinal data of, initially, 304 married couples from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (aged 64-98 years at Time 1; M = 76 years). Findings revealed that perceptual speed for husbands predicted subsequent perceptual speed decline for wives (time lags of 1 year). There was little evidence for the opposite unidirectional effect or a bidirectional association between husbands and wives. Potential covariates (age, education, medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms) did not account for differential lead-lag associations. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern was found for memory, which held except when functional limitations were controlled. Findings suggest that late-life cognitive development is not solely a product of intraindividual resources and are consistent with conceptual notions that development actively influences, and is influenced by, contextual factors such as close relationships. The authors discuss possible underlying mechanisms and further steps to substantiate the findings.",

      "title": "Marginalization through social ostracism: Effects of being ignored and excluded",
      "abstract": "Humans rely on social interactions with others to fulfill fundamental social, psychological, and survival needs. These interactions provide basic survival needs for mating, food, and protection, but also provide the higher-order socioeconomic advantages of cooperation and reciprocity. Perhaps most importantly, however, social interactions provide individuals with a sense of belonging and recognition from their mates. Not all social interactions are pleasant, yet they still provide a sense of recognition, and in some cases belonging. For instance, aversive forms of interpersonal interaction such as bullying and overt forms of rejection still provide the individual with a sense of recognition and importance. Others must go out of their ways to bully, to overtly reject, and this expended effort alone is substantiation that one deserves recognition. However, another aversive interpersonal behavior deprives the individual of the sense of recognition and meaning: ostracism. We define ostracism as being ignored and excluded (Williams, 1997, 2001, 2007, 2009). Ostracism can occur through the physical banishment or exile of an individual or group to venues that are separate from the others. In this sense, extreme forms of segregation could be viewed as physical ostracism. Ostracism can also occur without physical separation. When society's actions communicate to individuals or groups that they are psychologically invisible and inaudible to the larger society, they become socially ostracized. By being marginalized in this way, they have no measurable impact on their society. They are not recognized, nor do they have voice.",

For example, they judge killing as worse than letting die, and harm caused as a necessary means to a greater good as worse than harm caused as a side-effect (Cushman, Young, & Hauser, 2006). Are these patterns of judgment produced by mechanisms specific to the moral domain, or do they derive from other psychological domains? We show that the action/omission and means/side-effect distinctions affect nonmoral representations and provide evidence that their role in moral judgment is mediated by these nonmoral psychological representations. Specifically, the action/omission distinction affects moral judgment primarily via causal attribution, while the means/side-effect distinction affects moral judgment via intentional attribution. We suggest that many of the specific patterns evident in our moral judgments in fact derive from nonmoral psychological mechanisms, and especially from the processes of causal and intentional attribution.",

Pseudo-desire, promulgated by envy, achieves a semblance of satisfaction, as shown in the phallic attitudes of some women, who are immersed in imitation of the other sex, or at least of the image they have of it. Penis envy will disappear by itself the day the patient no longer has that painful feeling of deficiency which caused it. If one agrees to abandon an object-oriented view of the envied penis— and to defer all questions concerning the sociocultural legitimacy of the envy—then one can undertake a truly psychoanalytical approach. The association of penis envy with conscious or unconscious hatred toward the mother is frequently observed.",

      "abstract": "Imaginative pretend play is often thought of as the domain of young children, yet adults regularly engage in elaborated, fantastical, social-mediated pretend play. We describe imaginative play in adults via the term “pretensive shared reality;” Shared Pretensive Reality describes the ability of a group of individuals to employ a range of higher-order cognitive functions to explicitly and implicitly share representations of a bounded fictional reality in predictable and coherent ways, such that this constructed reality may be explored and invented/embellished with shared intentionality in an ad hoc manner. Pretensive Shared Reality facilitates multiple individual and social outcomes, including generating personal and group-level enjoyment or mirth, the creation or maintenance of social groups, or the safe exploration of individual self-concepts (such as alternative expression of a players sexual or gender identity). Importantly, Pretensive Shared Reality (both within the specific context of table-top role-playing games, and other instances) are primarily co-operative and co-creative. We draw on multiple examples, and focus on Table-Top Role Playing games (TTRPG) – and specifically, the most popular and enduring table-top role-playing games, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons (D&amp;amp;D) – as a primary example of such play. Our conception of “pretensive shared reality” links the widespread existence and forms of adult imaginative play to childhood pretense, places it within a developmental and evolutionary context, and argues that pretensive shared realities – which underpin many forms of imaginative culture – are an important topic of study unto themselves, and may be utilized to provide methodological insight into a variety of psychological domains.",

      "abstract": "In the framework of Western democracies, the movement for the prevention of cruelty to animals has been seen, ever since it dawned, as a lobby-a pressure group born to defend some spiritual inclinations, or subsidiary preferences, of some members of the political community. In the first case, the most suitable comparison is with a religious sect, or with a moralizing organization; in the second one, with some association of a more or less corporate nature. Still now, every time an opportunity for debate arises, people take care to present impartially the relevant views; here the animals' advocates, there the butchers, the furriers, the experimenters. In the democratic game, every lobby must get its due. This does not happen by accident. There is in our societies a particular class of criminal actions called It has been noticed l that, since murder, e. g., is also an offense against morals, such a definition cannot be interpreted but in a restrictive sense, and that offenses are therefore only those which impair nothing but morals. In fact, it is to the absence of an injured party that the other relevant expression, is related. Adultery, sodomy, incest and prostitution are the main examples; yet, the class also includes nonsexual offenses. One of these is cruelty to animals. The view that the rationale of the law could be, in addition to the protection ofone individual from another, also the punishment of moral wickedness, has been called moralism.2 Henceforth, I shall use the term morality to refer to the corpus of beliefs and customs that are allegedly impaired by the crimes and that legal moralism aims to defend; and the term morals to mean what is covered by the laws intended to protect one individual from another. In this sense, rape can be defined as a crime against morals, while homosexual relations between consenting adults can be-and often is-considered a crime against morality. Legal moralism, usually endorsed by conservatives, is criticized by liberals. The view that it may be possible to defend by legal, or else social, sanctions the conformity to a particular code ofbehavior that is shared by the majority at a certain time seems unacceptable to those for whom the memory of the Inquisition is raised by the contemporary revival of religious fanaticism. Thus, if the against animals fall within the victimless crimes, i. e., the against morality, the reaction against the movement for the defense of animals becomes explainable. The tolerance of the lobby is acceptable, or better, right, in a liberal society. If, however, the new sect becomes too aggressive, and",

Si ce processus a permis de constituer des imaginaires urbains autour de corps de prostituées féminines, et donc d’exalter une apparence physique spécifique consacrée au plaisir, en revanche, il semblerait que peu à peu, cette représentation de la femme sexuée se transfigure en mise en perspective du mâle féminisé, ou du moins réduit à des attributs/codes de séduction appartenant aux deux sexes : soit un homme-objet sportif, à la limite du gigolo, fait pour attirer les convoitises féminines, soit un homosexuel ou bisexuel, soit, paroxysme du borderline, le travesti ou vestida, encore plus beau et féminin qu’une femme, sorte de figure érotique par antonomase. Dès lors, il convient de nous interroger sur les représentations qu’engendrent ces êtres autant à la limite que l’univers dans lequel ils vivent, les désirs qu’ils suscitent et les constructions diégétiques qu’ils appellent. Sont-ils la métaphore d’une identité déjà mouvante ou le symbole de la disparition de l’archétype du macho latino ? Ou bien sont-ils encore une forme altérée du personnage postmoderne ?L’étude porte principalement sur trois ouvrages narratifs : la nouvelle « Marcos » du recueil Desnudamente Roja (2010) de Rosina Conde, et les romans 41 closets (2005) de Heriberto Yépez et Travesti (2009) de Carlos Reyes Ávila.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Forensic anthropologists who work in the medicolegal area are frequently requested to examine the partial or complete remains of individuals, with the goal generally being the identification of the individual in regard to age, sex, race, and stature. These data may then be used in an attempt to learn the identity of the individual or individuals. The condition of the material available for analysis varies tremendously. Complete skeletons with or without soft tissue should present the fewest problems. Those bodies which are less complete, consisting of parts of a skeleton only, present more problems in identification and in many instances may not be identifiable at all, although there are instances on record of individuals being identified on the basis of a few teeth and fragments of a mandible or maxilla.",

      "abstract": "Data from the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) Masculinity and Femininity scales have led to the hypothesis that androgynous individuals are more “behaviorally flexible” than others, manifesting both masculine and feminine role behaviors. Sex-role androgyny is also said to have other beneficial consequences such as high self esteem. The content of these instruments, however, is largely confined to socially desirable instrumental (masculine) and expressive (feminine) personality traits. A review of the literature indicates that these abstract trait dimensions have only minimal relationships with sex-role attitudes and sex-role behaviors not tapping instrumentality and expressiveness, and provide little support for the general behavioral flexibility hypothesis. Although PAQ and BSRI findings cannot be generalized to sex-role behaviors in general, the literature suggests that instrumentality and expressiveness per se have important implications. Appreciation of their contributions may be advanced more rapidly if these trait dimensions are disentangled from global concepts of sex-roles or masculinity, femininity, and androgyny.",

Through the use of glory holes, however, an even greater level of anonymity can be attained: sex with faceless partners. Analysis of glory hole use focuses on gay bathhouses and draws on Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of assemblages and machines. Poststructuralism represents a mode of enquiry that was developed chiefly by French philosophers in the 1960s and 1970s. Assemblages are collections of desires: the mouth is an assemblage, the penis is as well. In public health the glory hole user is defined as risky, and this is less for what he does than for who he is.",

      "abstract": "Cross-cultural and individual variation in erotic taste indicate that what we find sexually attractive depends on experience. Partner and other environmental cues can acquire sexually arousing (or inhibiting) properties through a variety of different types of learning processes, including imprinting, mere exposure, social learning, verbal relational learning, and operant conditioning. Most laboratory research on sexual learning, however, has employed classical conditioning procedures. Numerous studies demonstrate the impact of such conditioning on a wide range of sexual behaviors in non-humans, yet relatively few studies have shown such effects in humans. The chapter reviews the experimental research on classical conditioning of sexual arousal in humans, highlighting newer studies that use women participants and more diverse paradigms. Individual differences in conditionability and a distinction between signal versus evaluative learning are also considered. Such research has the potential to contribute to the literature on (human) learning theory as well as to enhance learning-based therapies used to alter problematic sexual responding, for example, in the case of sexual risk taking and/or sexual compulsivity.",

Respecting cultural differences as well as the need for sexual sensitivity can be daunting. For the clinicians, the suspicion or diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) is not about sex and relationships, but it is about disease. The patient's concerns are the opposite. STIs have always been part of the human condition. In most cultures, sex and sexual relationships are considered private and personal. However, when there is a diagnosis of an STI, that privacy is laid open to physical examination, inquiry, reporting, and expectations of disclosure. Complex feelings of betrayal, confusion, embarrassment, vulnerability, or shame are common when a patient is told he or she has an STI. These feelings transcend all cultures.",

      "title": "“No more a child, not yet an adult”: studying social cognition in adolescence",
      "abstract": "There are several reasons why adolescence is interesting. It is in this phase that an individual finds herself fully facing the external world: basically equipped with the kind of social cognition that s/he has acquired at home, at school and through the media during childhood, s/he has now to meet a host of other, diverse views of what \"reasonable\", \"appropriate\" or \"expected\" courses of thought and emotions are, in the wild with friends and peers, romantic or sexual partners, teachers and employers, and the society at large. Furthermore, she is also expected, both at home and in the external world, to have a wholly new degree of control over such courses. While the idea that the development of social cognition still progresses after infancy (and possibly throughout the life span) is clearly gaining consensus in the field, the literature building on it is still scarce. One of the reasons for this probably is that most tests used to study it focus on its basic component, namely ToM, and have been mostly devised for us with children; therefore, they are not suitable to deal with the hugely increasing complexity of social and mental life during adolescence and adulthood. Starting from a review of the literatuer available, we will argue that the development of social cognition should be viewed as a largely yet-to-be-understood mix of biological and cultural factors. While it is widely agreed upon that the very initial manifestations of social life in the newborn are largely driven by an innate engine with which all humans are equally endowed, it is also evident that each culture, and each individual within it, develops specific adult versions of social cognition.",

      "title": "Against the Ugliness of Age: Towards an Erotics of the Aging Sexual Body",
      "abstract": "Within the heteronormative construction, older people are positioned as asexual, post-sexual or predatory on young bodies. Ageist assumptions deny their sexual desires exist at all or, if they are acknowledged, frame them within pathological medical, sexological and cultural discourses that characterize older sexual agency as grotesque, ugly, unattractive and sexually undesirable. These normative constructions have a negative impact on older sexual subjectivities. This article begins to develop a constructive representational form – or erotics - of aging sex and sexuality. Queer, as a deconstructionist, anti-foundational and anti-essential perspective, would seem the most prominent means by which to challenge pathologies of the ageing body and ageing sexuality. However, this discussion will suggest that there is both scope and limitations with regards to the ability of Queer critiques to undermine ageist erotophobia. Whilst queer proposes that we are free to construct and reconstruct our sexuality in multiple ways, our changing subjectivities are not just experienced emotionally and intra-psychically but are also bounded by our physicality. Our ageing corporeality prevents a constant and continuous reinvention of the sexual self. This does not preclude an erotics of age that -moves away from genito-centric and heteronormative/ homonormative constructions of sexuality and open up the potential for an erotic aged sex and sexual intimacy.",

      "title": "Deviance, Medicalization of",
      "abstract": "Medicalization is the process whereby previously nonmedical aspects of life come to be seen in medical terms, usually as disorders or illnesses. A wide range of phenomena have been medicalized, including normal life events (birth, death), biological processes (aging, menstruation), common human problems (learning and sexual difficulties), and forms of deviance. The medicalization of deviance thus refers to the process whereby non‐normative or morally condemned appearance (obesity, unattractiveness, shortness), belief (mental disorder, racism), and conduct (drinking, gambling, sexual practices) come under medical jurisdiction. The tendency to see badness – whether immoral, sinful, or criminal – as illness is part of a broader historical trend from overtly punitive to ostensibly more humanitarian responses to deviance. Within this trend most scholars agree that medicalization has been on the increase, though they disagree as to why, to what degree, and with what consequences this is the case. It is clear, however, that medicalization processes are caught up in and complicate struggles to define and respond to deviance. Constructing deviance as illness confers a moral status that is different from crime or sin. As such, medicalization has implications for social control, power, knowledge, authority, and personal liberty.",

Intersexuality describes a wide range of conditions in which individuals' primary sex characteristics, secondary sex characteristics, and/or chromosomal makeup do not match in expected ways. Intersexuality can be caused by a wide variety of factors including abnormal prenatal developmental and chromosomal anomalies (e.g., XXY or XXX). There is considerable diversity in how it is evaluated and treated. Central to this diversity of response are foundational arguments and assumptions about the relationship between gender (femininity/masculinity) and sex (female/male), as well as whether nature (e.g., chromosomes and hormones) or nurture (e.g., socialization processes) determine gender identity. Many medical professionals adhere to a concealment‐centered approach of treating intersexuality, whereas intersex advocates adhere to a patient‐centered model.",

There are two main types; gestational surrogacy and traditional surrogacy.

In the traditional form, the surrogate mother is impregnated naturally or artificially, and the child is genetically related to the surrogate. In either case the intended parent(s) may seek such arrangements when pregnancy may be difficult, or because they are male. If the surrogate mother is paid (other than out-of-pocket expenses), the arrangement is commercial surrogacy; otherwise it is ‘altruistic' surrogacy. Legal situations and costs vary, and if possible at all, usually requires specific arrangements between countries.

The prefix “bi” in bisexual also implicates a binary, which has become a contentious issue in an era when the gender binary itself has come to be questioned, and has proven problematic in lesbian and gay politics. Owing to the influence of early sexuality research conducted in Western Europe, the term bisexuality has spread and come to be employed in various cultural contexts.

The latest studies on homosexuality in fact relate to the manner in which people construct their homosexual identity in the social context and family. The aim of this thesis is to identify the influence that family semantic exercise over the whole coming out process. It was noted that family semantic identified by Ugazio (2012) bring in specific trajectories effects and different from each other, as shown by the fantasies and erotic behavior, from the definition that the individual gives himself over to their sexuality, the degree of consistency between these two variables, the level of homophobia, from the expected reactions from parents at the time of the unveiling at home and the parents' concern after the son's statement. The semantics of freedom, with its values and emotions, seems to make the process of coming out easier than other semantic. Significant results also emerge in relation to the assumption of a positioning closer and similar to the father, who instead make it more difficult the process from awareness of his homosexuality to the unveiling family. Future studies, with a more extensive sample, will corroborate this argument and thus provide important contributions in the clinical field.",

      "title": "How to Relate Two Specific Concepts: Sexual Health and Sexual Minority?",
      "abstract": "Introduction WHO defines Sexual Health as “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality… and requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence”. OCD-10 defines Transsexualism as “the desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by the wish to make his or her body as congruent as possible with the preferred sex through surgery and hormone treatment. The transsexual identity has been present persistently for at least two years. The disorder is not a symptom of another mental disorder or a chromosomal abnormality”. Objective We developed an integrative model in 4 axes to approach Sexual Health concept and Transsexualism. Aims Holistic and integrative model of transsexualism gives a better understanding of this disorder and ameliorates global treatment. Moreover, this model should be applied to each sexual minority. Results 1. Etiology integrates psychological, biological and neuro-developmental aspects. 2. Clinical features for treatment imply large and multidisciplinary approach. 3. Scientific literature includes more than thousand papers on Transsexualism and numerous expertises as endocrinology, psychiatry, cardiology, sleep… 4. Social networks are developed in hospitals, associations… as well as between patients themselves. Conclusions Holistic and integrative approach of Sexual Minority as Transsexualism could reach Sexual Health concept defined by WHO.

      "title": "Cultural services and related goods",
      "abstract": "Cultural services and related goods are mostly related to the pleasure, inspiration, or spiritual or religious enrichment people derive from spending time in nature, particularly PAs (Table 8.1). The drivers behind these (often intangible) benefits are as manifold as the motivations of people visiting PAs. The benefits derived can relate to enjoying nature's amenities and tranquillity, observing different habitats and species, and gaining a deeper understanding of nature's functions. Nature is also often used as a destination for religious pilgrimages or as a 'medium' for building social relations. Some visitors may be driven by educational reasons, others in search of artistic inspiration – or even for technological innovations. In practice, the visits to PAs often combine and interlink several different benefits. Recreation and tourism are among the key ecosystem services from PAs. These benefits are frequently used interchangeably, with several valuation studies assessing the two together. Arguably the main difference between the two is that tourism generally refers to activities (also recreational) occurring outside people's usual everyday environment, often including travelling (day trips or overnight stays) (UNWTO, 2008). The same recreational opportunities can be available within the usual environment and local communities, though then they are not considered touristic (Bio Intelligence Service, 2011). PAs can be important destinations within the fast growing sector of nature tourism (Bell et al., 2007), i.e. tourism relying primarily on the natural environment as an attraction to visitors. Tourism related benefits can be based on both use and non-use values (Chapter 3) with the former including fishing and hunting and the latter being focused on bird and nature watching or more sporting activities such as biking, swimming, horse riding, and mountain biking (Bell et al., 2007).",

      "abstract": "Labeling certain developments which occurred in the 1960s and 1970s as a \"sexual revolution\" may make us believe that needed changes have already happened and that we can now direct our attention to other matters. Forthcoming changes in human sexuality are complex and multifaceted issues. Our control over the outcomes of sexual relating--with contraceptives, artificial insemination, germinal banks, and in vitro fertilization--have already altered many aspects of both sexual and human relating, and will alter them even more in the future. Another development offering greater control over the consequences of sexual relating comes from shifting from 1 discipline as an authority for moral sexual decision-making to another, and later still another. The locus of control has shifted from Christianity to medicine to a more human acceptance of sex and a more rational process of decision making. The integration of sexuality into a broader concept of thinking is moving us away from a concentration on the genitals and genital activity toward an awareness that we all are sexual persons. Judgments relating to suitable criteria for determining the rightness and wrongness of sexual behavior have experienced a marked change. There are, however, 4 factors which may lead in diametrically opposite directions: 1)the militaristic buildup which, if it continues, threatens to divide the world into armed camps; 2) dealing with certain environmental elements or technological developments--such as Chernobly--that may in the end exert so much power over our lives that we will be reduced to a struggle simply to remain alive; 3) our fragmented personal relationships and the often confusing and antagonistic attitude of 1 group to another; and 4) the spread of AIDS which is decreasing our present level of sexual activity and curtailing our freedom.",

      "abstract": "Very little research has examined what goes on in the minds of young men during sex. Such an exploration might reveal gender-normative discourses as well as challenges to such. This discourse analysis understands internal speech as that which both instantiates status quo ideals of masculinity and which challenges them. We use theories of hegemonic masculinity and Vygotskyan notions of “others in the head” to understand how hegemonic masculinity is reproduced during the act of having sex. This study is based on qualitative interviews with thirteen heterosexual young adult US men asking what goes through their mind during sex. Young heterosexual men produce a masculinity discourse that supports dominant constructions of heterosexuality, monitoring their sexual behaviors based on imagined and expected reactions of abstract and very real male reference groups. The analysis shows men describing thoughts during sex that make sex like work, keeps in mind a variety of other people, some literally awaiting news of the sex, and some abstract representations of masculinity. Men report a constant self-evaluation based on women’s performances of pleasure, for example, screaming, never construed as inauthentic, or as a performance at all. Thoughts about masculinity were not present in intimate moments when men described a “letting go of masculinity” in order to be intimate.",

As a story about sex it is (possibly) salacious and will reveal things about me that some may regard as private, better left unsaid and unsuitable in an academic essay. Except that I am not an academic and this is not an academic essay but a story of someone usually identified as a (transsexual) woman. Except I don’t identify myself as a binary transsexual woman but as a non-binary assigned male at birth (AMAB) person. In writing about my sex life I want to ask a few questions about (my) gender, sexuality, identity and deception. \r\nSex, at least for me, can be risky in more ways than one. I’m anally receptive but sexual risk for me is not all about possible exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is also whether a sexual encounter might leave me as a victim of “trans panic”: will the next person who fucks me perhaps beat me senseless before claiming I deceived them and they didn’t know I was AMAB until it was too late? Am I at more risk, and also more deceptive, if a partner thinks I’m a cis-gender woman or a binary transsexual woman? Just where does the line between being “out and proud”, passing and deception lie for me as a non-binary AMAB surviving in a largely binary world? \r\nIn this essay, I thus wish to explore how issues of sex and deception might interact and raise questions for me as a non-binary, AMAB person. In doing so I will attempt to interweave a critical analysis of some media stories of sexual deception with an autoethnographic account of sex. I am not wise enough to have answers to my questions, however, but instead hope that others may do so.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Exploitation",
      "abstract": "Child sexual exploitation (CSE) is a broad term that refers to a form of child sexual abuse (CSA) involving some combination of particular elements including power imbalance, grooming, manipulation, coercion, deception, fraud, force, threats, exchange, or status. Definitions, research, and resources are inconsistent and often conflate different kinds of CSE and CSA, making the concept difficult to generalize and questioning the utility of separating CSE from CSA. There are also persistent misunderstandings and myths that continue to pervade society, including “stranger danger” and the notion that CSE cannot happen in one’s own community, which have potential to negatively impact community protective behaviors. There are multiple kinds of CSE, both offline and online, and demarcating offline and online is not always possible or advisable. More than one type of CSE may be present in a single case because they are not mutually exclusive. These include child sexual exploitation material (CSEM), livestreaming, capping, online sexual solicitation and child luring, sextortion, commercial sexual exploitation, CSA tourism, human trafficking, and forced marriage. Common among these, although potentially in different forms, is a process of grooming. Because CSE is diverse, it is difficult to generalize about offenders and victims. However, victims are more likely to be female, whereas offenders are more likely to be male. Also common across crime types are a host of social, emotional, personal, and physical effects on and consequences for victims, some of which may be exacerbated if there are online elements such as images or videos. Current best practice suggests that responding to victims should be done through a trauma-informed approach that avoids victim-blaming. For offenders, risk management is done through assessments, post-release laws, and treatment, all of which have their own limitations. Because CSE is complex and includes a range of crimes, different theoretical and conceptual perspectives can be applied to the topic. Some of these focus on sexual offending against children generally, whereas others situate CSE within more macro structures. These theories and perspectives include Lanning’s situational versus preferential offender typology, the psychological concept of “cognitive distortions,” Finkelhor’s model of preconditions to CSA, the Good Lives Model of offending and rehabilitation, ecological systems theory, criminological perspectives that emphasize situational and environmental factors, and anthropological perspectives on the internet. Prevention of CSE victimization should be evidence-based and not founded on misconceptions or myths; however, not all prevention programs have engaged with realistic and accurate understandings of CSE. Overall, CSE is complex, and nuance is required in research, practice, and policy to reflect this complexity.",

      "abstract": "Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults may be more vulnerable to elder abuse (EA) due to prior marginalization and trauma, lifelong discrimination, and health disparities. While characteristics of both victims and perpetrators can modify the risk for EA, few studies have focused on perpetrators. This study examined the number and type of perpetrator-victim relationships and perpetrator profiles for EA experienced in the prior year, by abuse type and sexual orientation and gender identity of the abused. Data are from community-dwelling Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 65 or older at follow-up 1 (n = 23,466). Heterosexual men and women reported being abused psychologically and physically most often by spouses or partners. Gay and bisexual (GB) men reported being abused psychologically most often by non-family, non-friend “others”. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women reported psychological and financial abuse most often by siblings or other family members, and physical abuse by non-family, non-friend “others”. Heterosexual women were abused financially most often by their children, and both heterosexual and GB men reported more financial abuse by “others” or friends. Overall, 15% and 5% of participants reported abuse by multiple perpetrators of psychological and financial abuse respectively. LB women experienced more EA overall (18.8%), by multiple perpetrators (31% for psychological abuse, 66.5% for financial abuse) including by their siblings and other family members. These results have important implications for mitigation and preventive measures. They also highlight the need for further research concerning sexual minorities experiencing multiple abuse types and/or abuse by multiple perpetrators.",

Rehabilitation interventions are aimed to return the individual to full health by either restoration of past physical, cognitive or social capabilities or strengthening aspects of self to counter such loss. However, rehabilitation interventions do not result in a complete return to past physical, mental or social health. Does this mean that people with disability can never be healthy? Or does it indicate that our perception and definition of health does not reflect the essence of health? We argue that when people with disability redefine themselves in terms other than levels of physical, social and cognitive functioning, good health is an attainable goal. We discuss evidence that suggests why spirituality could be a primary determinant of health.",

The importance of the capacity to adapt and adjust to the changes and losses of old age and to sustain intimacy is highlighted in research that shows that marital closeness moderates the negative psychological impact of functional disability in later life in terms of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. The couple were just entering later life, and facing depression as lifelong defences were wearing thin, he having had affairs throughout the marriage and confronted by impotence as a consequence of treatment for prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are socially connected are happier and healthier than their more isolated counterparts. Over the past few decades, researchers have established that both the quantity and quality of our social relationships are unequivocally important when it comes to our physical and mental health, and our risk of mortality. Although the link between social relationships and mental health is well established in a couple, we have only just begun to identify explanations for this link. Recently, social scientists have discovered that the link between social relationships and health is explained by our behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet), various psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, mental health, cultural norms), and physiological processes. Aggression in marital relationship is defined as a manipulative, physical or non-physical form of aggression meant to negatively impact the development of relationship by social exclusion or harming the social status of a victim by spreading or behaving negatively. Research findings suggest that even infrequent experiences with relational aggression victimization are associated with lower subjective well-being such as depression, loneliness, and positive affect. This case study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a couple and the relationship between relational aggression and own subjective well-being. The participant in the study is married and from nuclear family. The study tries to investigate aggression level through the case study method and relaxation, yoga, meditation techniques used which was used to resolve the aggression and helps to achieve well being.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Refugees and asylum seekers are individuals who are seeking to settle elsewhere other than their country of origin largely due to persecution due to their political, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation. The definitions are often complicated and dictated by the legal system of the new country. Never before has culture, race, and ethnicity been so relevant and important in the mental health field and/or in psychiatric practice, as it is at the present time, and in this chapter we propose to set the scene.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Childhood is a vital period of life undergoing process of socialization involving transmission of attitudes, customs and behaviors through in uence of family and community on the adult for all needs .A discerning adults can understand and meet these needs and help the child to a make a smooth transition through journey into adulthood . India is a home to almost 19% of world’s children. More than one third of the country population around 440 million is below 18 years However in India, which has the largest number of child population in the world, nearly 40% of the its population 69% of Indian children are victims of child abuse .According to WHO: ‘’Child abuse or maltreatment Constitutes all forms of physical and/or emo- tional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent Treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child’s health . Child abuse includes, physical violence 75%, sex- ual molestation 20%, mental and emotional 5%, maltreatment with negligence, deprivation and lack of opportunity . A recently conducted survey revealed shocking facts pertaining to child abuse in India. More than 53% su ered with sexual abuse, while 54% with physical and 48% with emotional abuse at the hands of par- ents and family members. Sexual abuse is one of the most devastat- ing type of child maltreatment and estimates that it has increased significantly during past decade. According to a 2007 survey sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development over 53% of the children have been sexually abused . Children between 5 and 12 years old are the most vulnerable age group and boys out number girls with 52.94% reporting abuse. In February 2011, the times of India re- ported that every 2.5 hours a child below 16 years of age and every 13 hours a child below 10 years of age is raped in India making it the country with the highest number of child sexual abuse of any country. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males according to a 2009 study pub- lished in Clinical Psychology .According to the study done by Chithra M (2011), regarding mothers knowledge regarding child abuse re- vealed that majority of mothers (82%) have inadequate knowledge child abuse. The mother is the primary care giver for the child hence has a major role to play in this arena. This prompted the researcher to undertake this study focusing on mothers. Language: en",

Some of these causes are visible, such as addictions, where alcohol and drugs is higher for men; or violence, as in the case of terrorist suicide or after episodes of domestic violence. Other causes are more hidden as failing to fulfill their role as providers, or helplessness and depression to which men are confronted with difficulty because of their problems more trouble for help or show their emotions.

      "abstract": "Social scientists often examine events, for example, the occurrence of a militarized dispute, unemployment, or adoption. Events like these connote change or represent a transition from one state to another. Frequently, this concern with events is tied to an interest in the history preceding the event, for example, the number of years leading up to a war or the number of months a child is in foster care before adoption. History, thought of in this way, involves timing, and for many research questions, the timing of social change is at least as interesting as understanding the event culminating the history. Such questions naturally lend themselves to an examination of both the occurrence of an event and the history leading up to the event's occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse is not uncommon and not restricted to any one socioeconomic group. Sexual activity between adults and children within the same family has been taboo throughout the world and throughout time. Unfortunately, this taboo has not been enough to protect children from the great harm that such activity causes them. Both within the family and in society at large, the child has been thought culpable of dishonesty and worthy of blame in the situations where disclosure has been attempted. Symptoms experienced by adults who were victims of childhood sexual abuse are those of a chronic or delayed post-traumatic stress disorder, as described by C. Courtois. It is vitally important that victims who disclose the abuse are met with acceptance, belief and hope for healing from their physicians. The patients need to understand that their dreams, nightmares and symptoms are a natural response to the trauma that they have suffered.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For children as well as adults, object categories (e.g., dog, animal, car, vehicle) serve as a rich base for inductive inferences. Here, we examine children's inferences regarding categories of people. We showed 4‐year‐old children a picture of an individual (e.g., a white woman), taught them a novel property of the individual (e.g., is good at a new game called zaggit), and examined children's projections of that property to other individuals. Experiment 1 revealed that children used the broad category person as an inductive base: they extended the novel property to other people, regardless of their race or gender, but not to non‐human animals or artifacts. However, naming prompted children to use more specific social categories as an inductive base. When the target individual was identified as a member of a named, novel social category, children were more likely to extend the property to members of the same race‐based (Experiment 2) or gender‐based (Experiment 3) category as the target. Implications of naming in children's formation of social categories based on race or gender are discussed, and the consequences on the emergence of stereotypes are considered.

      "title": "Beyond the given and the all-giving: extraneous speculations on women and the gift",
      "abstract": "There needs to be a recognition that the phenomenon of the gift and the fascination it exerts for contemporary thinkers is a measure of dissatisfaction with prevailing norms. As a test case, the phenomenon of the gift needs to be perceived as an instance of heterogeneity in a culture that, despite its convoluted escape mechanisms, cannot honestly confront its repressive controlling impulses. The gift is thus a symptom par excellence of Western tendencies to distort for its own purposes (whether benign, malevolent or simply ignorant) whatever is viewed as alien, exotic or excluded. This has largely been (non-Western) cultures, women and those of other racial, class or ethnic varieties. Such behaviour is evident not just in anthropology and literature, but in philosophy, and especially in religious studies where the prevailing norm has been the cliché of the neutral male scholar. Insofar as this propensity is unacknowledged, the gift will remain an enigma to a society such as ours that refuses to admit not just its blind-spots (whether cultural, racial or sexual), but the mechanisms that continue to produce them. It will thus compensate by demonizing or idealizing uncritically, the other as bearer of those repressions that make its continued flourishing possible. These examples of selective reading of questionable data and utopian improvisations highlight a common predicament as the Eurocentric mindset is confronted by otherness — be it its former colonized peoples or its own internalized forms of exclusion.",

Se pretende profundizar en la vinculacion existente entre la vejez y el proceso de envejecer desde un enfoque de genero y, en algunos casos, su vision del feminismo. El prisma de genero resulta fundamental para analizar el envejecimiento, ya que aun hoy, no es lo mismo envejecer siendo hombre o mujer. En los resultados iniciales, parece que el feminismo/s (e incluso el constructo genero o vejez) solo forma parte del discurso de algunas entrevistadas que muestran un perfil muy concreto. Esta ausencia puede interpretarse como indicador de que la perspectiva de genero (y/o feminismo) aplicada al envejecimiento activo y a la vejez, aun no ha calado de manera clara en las organizaciones sociales mas implicadas en las personas mayores.",

Paternal behavior is often characterized as being indirect, such as construction of shelter and resource defense—behaviors that might benefit offspring but do not require male–offspring interaction—or direct, such as carrying and grooming—behaviors that involve physical interaction and immediately benefit young. Mammalian males rarely invest in their young and particularly engage in few substantive direct interactions with their offspring. Among primates, including humans, indirect forms of paternal behavior are more common than direct forms. Recent phylogenetic analyses have shed light on potential socioecological pressures and benefits of male care that might select for intensive levels of paternal behavior.",

      "title": "Effects of social experience on the behaviour of male guinea pigs and rats",
      "abstract": "Most animals have some social experience, and in non-solitary species social experiences may be frequent and various. Evolutionary theory predicts this experience should lead to changes in behaviour which maximise inclusive fitness. However, the effects of such experience on subsequent behaviour are largely unknown. Investigation of the effects of social experience on behaviour requires examination of the nature, causes and functions of social behaviour and organisation under natural and experimental conditions. In a semi-natural colony of guinea pigs, a male dominance hierarchy was found. Comparison of dominance status with social behaviour suggested that agonistic experience determined subsequent agonism and (to a lesser extent) courtship. Both sexes apparently responded to males according to physical and behavioural cues indicative of resource holding power (Parker, 1974). Early experience has often been studied in attempts to find critical periods for socialization. Isolation of rats during the post-weaning period of social play has long-term effects on some non-social and agonistic behaviours (Einon et al, 1981; Wahlstrand et al, 1983). Early isolation of non-playing rodents (including guinea pigs) has no long-term effects on non-social behaviour (Einon et al, 1981). This suggests that social play might be important in the socialisation of playing species. The effects of both isolation and experience of females on male rat behaviour was examined. Early-isolated rats showed abnormalities in intra-group social behaviour, but no increase in aggressiveness. No group studied had a consistent social organisation. Parallel experiments with guinea pigs showed increased intra-group aggressive intensity, but no other differences in social behaviour or organisation. Prolonged grouping increased individual differences in aggressiveness under all conditions, but dominance hierarchies were only formed when females were present. Reduced courtship by subordinates was apparently due to both direct and indirect effects of agonistic experience. These findings are discussed in terms both of the causes and functions of behaviour, and of the social ecologies of the two species.",
