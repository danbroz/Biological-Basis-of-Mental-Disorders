      "abstract": "The word “delirium” is synonymous with these terms: acute confusional state, encephalopathy, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, organic mental syndrome, organic psychosis, and toxic psychosis. Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "abstract": "of the forthcoming 10th revision of the International Classification ofDiseases contains a list of reactions to severe stress and adjustment disorders.3 Two examples provide sufficient illustration.Acute stress reaction comprises exposure to an exceptional medical or physical stress followed by the onset, within one hour, of generalised anxiety or any two of the following: social withdrawal, narrowing of attention, apparent disorientation, anger or verbal aggression, despair or hopelessness, inapprop- riate or purposeless overactivity, and uncontrollable and excessive grief.Treatment is supportive and non-specific and the prognosis is favourable.Post-traumatic stress disorder includes brief or prolonged exposure to an exceptional mental or physical stress followed within six months by persistent remembering or reliving of the stress; by intrusive flashbacks, vivid memories, recurring dreams; or by distress when exposed to (or avoiding) circumstances associated with the stressor.These features are accompanied by either psychogenic amnesia or persistent increased psychological sensitivity and arousal with at least two of the following: difficulty in falling or staying asleep, irritability, difficulty concentrating, distractibility or increased restlessness and apprehension.Again, treatment is supportive and non-specific, though the long term outlook is uncertain.Thus at a popular level stress is a vigorous concept that has engendered a prosperous industry dedicated to its relief, while in scientific and medical contexts the concept languishes with dubious reliability and validity.Fifty years ago the stress hypothesis began displacing obscure focuses of infection as an antecedent of a variety of life's ills.As Susser has remarked: \"Many excellent sets of teeth and many pairs of tonsils were sacrificed to that hypothesis.We can count ourselves fortunate that the stress hypothesis does not require surgical intervention.\"'14",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Diagnóstico y tratamiento del insomnio en el adulto mayor",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the diffi culty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

They consist of a vision of small people, occasionally accompanied by animals or by other objects of minute size. These phenomena have nothing to do with micropsy. The hallucinations are usually multiple, mobile and of bright color. The patient sometimes hears the small people speaking with a \"lilliputian\" voice. The hallucinations are usually associated with a pleasant state of mind, rarely having an unpleasant or terrifying effect on the patient. Lilliputian hallucinations have occurred in the most varied conditions: arteriosclerosis, senile psychosis, alcoholic psychosis and most of the toxic and toxi-infectious states (typhoid, cholera, erysipelas, pneumonia, purulent pluerisy, etc.). They are observed occasionally in dreams and in the hypnagogic state. Various drugs—ether, cocaine, alcohol, hashish, hyoscine,<sup>2</sup>caffeine citrate<sup>3</sup>—can produce lilliputian hallucinations. Few cases of lilliputian hallucinations have been reported in the literature on schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "A psychiatric emergency is acute behavioral disturbance requiring urgent intervention, manifesting with mood, thought disorder or behavioral signs and symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies can have a variety of presentations and occur in a variety of settings:. A psychiatric emergency can be conceptualized under following broad categories: Acute onset of illness in a person with no past background of a psychiatric illness Acute exacerbation of a chronic psychiatric illness or an acute relapse in a psychiatric illness of recurring nature Psychiatric symptoms resulting from an underlying medical illness or use of a psychoactive substance or prescription drug. Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "title": "Drugs Highly Associated with Infusion Reactions Reported using Two Different Data-mining Methodologies",
      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable.

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

In volunteer subjects, they have been known to produce a variety of intense and unusual psychic effects. These include bizarre visual phenomena, ranging from a heightening of the apparent brightness or beauty of colored objects in the environment, through distortions in the perceived nature or meaning of real objects (illusions) to true visual hallucinations of colors, shapes, or even of complex scenes or events. These visual phenomena are usually accompanied by intense and often rapidly shifting emotional experiences (ranging from mild apprehension to panic, severe depression or mystical elation) or by concurrent emotions (such as depression and joy) which are not experienced simultaneously under ordinary conditions. Subjects describe changes in body image, the body or its parts appearing larger or smaller, intense feelings of depersonalization, including states in which the subject believes he is",

Conditions associated with Amnestic Syndrome of either transient or persistent course include thiamine deficiency, head trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, subarachnoid hemorrhage, herpes simplex encephalitis, brain tumor, bilateral posterior cerebral arterial occlusion, and cerebral hypoxia. Management approaches are similar to those described for demented patients. The most commonly implicated substances are alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs. Several other drugs have been reported to produce amnestic disorders, including bromides, isoniazid, and anticholinergic agents.

Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12.

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

First, a case is presented of a 150-day delay period before the clinical manifestations of brain damage after a single brief (<1 day) exposure to dimethylmercury. The second example is taken from the Iraq outbreak of methylmercury poisoning in which the victims consumed contaminated bread for several weeks without any ill effects. Indeed, signs of poisoning did not appear until weeks or months after exposure stopped. The last example is drawn from observations on nonhuman primates and from the sequelae of the Minamata, Japan, outbreak in which low chronic doses of methylmercury may not have produced observable behavioral effects for periods of time measured in years. The mechanisms of these latency periods are discussed for both acute and chronic exposures. Parallels are drawn with other diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as Parkinson disease and post-polio syndrome, that also reflect the delayed appearance of central nervous system damage.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "abstract": "In previous papers (2, 3) we have set forth our neurophysiopathogenic theory of alcoholism, which is an amplification of Jellinek's hypothesis (1) that the gamma and delta types of alcoholism form an addictive disease. The physical dependence characterized by a state of distress and an overpowering desire to consume more ethanol, assumes three forms: ( a) “inability to stop” the ingestion (Jellinek's “loss of control”) noted moments after ingesting a small quantity of ethanol following a period of abstinence, which characterizes the gamma or intermittent clinical form of alcoholism; ( b) “inability to abstain” from ethanol hours after the last ingestion and after continuous drinking (each 4 to 8 hours during months or years), which characterizes the delta or inveterate clinical form of alcoholism, and ( c) primary physical dependence without ethanol having necessarily been ingested previously, which characterizes remittent, or epsilon alcoholism or dipsomania.",

Establish the onset of problem, and whether it is acute, subacute, or chronic. Vertigo is usually paroxysmal. Constant vertigo suggests psychogenic and not vestibular dysfunction. Chronic conditions such as acoustic neuroma rarely present with vertigo. Aggravating factors can be head or body position. Benign positional vertigo accounts for about half of all cases of vertigo. Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fullness of ears, hearing loss, tinnitus, all of which suggest otological etiologies; headaches, diplopia, blurred vision, ataxia, paresthesia, all suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) etiologies.

In this chapter, some classic histologic findings in acute and chronic poisoning (including substance abuse) are presented. The determination of cause and manner of death in a poisoning requires a careful summation of circumstance, toxicology, and autopsy. Toxicology results are usually necessary, but alone are not sufficient for forming an opinion on cause and manner. Many variables, including postmortem redistribution, post-exposure survival, and overlap between therapeutic and toxic ranges, introduce uncertainty in the interpretation of postmortem drug levels. Gross and microscopic findings at autopsy can be supportive of acute and/or chronic substance abuse or may show unexpected sequelae of chronic substance abuse (e.g., infective endocarditis). Sometimes histology may be the first clue in a case of poisoning. An example of this is finding oxalate crystals in the kidneys of an otherwise unremarkable autopsy, as ethylene glycol is not detected by most toxicology laboratories in routine screening.",

Acute symptoms include: dizziness, headache, disorientation, ataxia, foul breath, with conditions proceeding to nausea, slurred speech, belligerence, irritability, and delirium. Chronic conditions are characterized by a strong psychological, but weaker physical dependence, with a wide range of comorbid psychiatric and social disorders.

      "abstract": "Head injury is a common event occurring in 1–2 million people in the U.S. yearly. Head injuries may cause minor inconvenience or it may induce major cognitive changes such as memory loss, concentration difficulties, headache, hearing loss, and visual difficulties, associated with or without loss of consciousness. Two of the major events occurring after head injuries which are not commonly recognized but which significantly alter behavior are loss of smell acuity and subsequent onset of smell distortions or phantosmia. Most patients are unaware that these two events can occur but they are present in most patients who experience head injury of any severity. Initially, patients recognize that they cannot recognize any odors and subsequently recognize that they cannot obtain any flavor from any food or drink. Over time they recognize that they experience a peculiar, usually unpleasant, odor in their nose in absence of any external odor. These odors may be persistent or transient, usually unpleasant, and may be described as fecal‐like, burned, chemical‐like, or metallic. The phantom, if persistent, can be severe enough to initiate loss of appetite with subsequent weight loss and depression. We have evaluated over 200 patients with smell loss and phantosmia after a head injury at The Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC over the past 40 years attempting to understand their cognitive changes in smell function. We have found that the mechanism for these cognitive changes relate to metabolic changes mainly in biochemical changes in both sensory and brain function in which specific growth factors which maintain olfactory function have been diminished and specific brain neurotransmitters, mainly gamma‐aminobutyric acid, have also been diminished. Correction of these abnormalities commonly corrects the smell loss, inhibits the phantosmia and improves cognition.",

Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel \"normal,\" even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms.<sup>1</sup> Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "abstract": "Taking opiates for medical purposes without supervision of healthcare professionals and non-medical purposes can cause different consequences such as delirium or even injury, and may cause addiction over a longer period of time. The most common recreational opium is heroin, while opium is rarely used. Opiate groups include opium, morphine, heroin, methadone and codeine. Addiction is manifested through physical and psychological dependence. Physical or biological dependence refers to the change in the biological state of the organism, while psychic addiction implies the forced necessity of entering the substance into the organism in order to restore good mood and to avoid the suffering of certain substances. Addiction leads to acute intoxication characterized by euphoria, facial redness, pruritus, impaired breathing depth, hypotension and bradycardia. Apart from the symptoms of acute intoxication, the use of opiates can lead to serious and even lethal consequences such as neurological diseases, hepatitis, HIV and AIDS. Treatment of opiate dependence implies treatment with naloxone and clinical treatment. Very important for the treatment of overexpression is to determine tolerance to opiates to determine the required dose of the drug. In the Republic of Croatia, the legal framework for the fight against drug abuse is based on the Criminal Code and the Law on Combating Drug Abuse, while at the European Union level the National Strategy for the Suppression of Drug Abuse in the Republic of Croatia was adopted. This research was carried out in order to determine the existence of differences in urban and rural addicts with regard to social demographic characteristics.Research has shown that addicts in urban areas are equally to addicts in rural areas by the time of arrival to the drogs band that addicts in urban and rural areas relatively early start with addiction treatment. The study included 57 respondents divided by sex and area of residence.

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis.

Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan.

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "abstract": "1. IntroductionA lot many factors are available which contribute to this avoidable adventure. Out of these few which are highly relevant have been lineated as follows. Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "New psychoactive substances—Synthetic stimulants",
      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system.

      "abstract": "Abstract Many of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal are similar to those of other drug withdrawal syndromes: anxiety, awakening during sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, irritability/anger and restlessness. Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ).

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs, It is most commonly reported with combinations of serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

The subject sees, with closed eyes, with open eyes in a dark room or against the background of a screen, a wealth of visons characterized by lavish colors and more or less geometric forms, all of which are in perpetual movement. Among other symptoms, some of which are remarkably constant and occur in practically every case, are: a general passive attitude; a surprising disorientation as to the time that elapses during the experiment; a tendency to observe tiny details in the immediate environment, such as beginning fine cracks in the wall; an increased sensitiveness and attention to all colors in the environment; a feeling that the whole body is lighter; a pleasant",

      "abstract": "DiscussionThere has been an increase recently in the use of L.S.D. in this country on a casual basis and not under medical supervision.Use in this way as a \"mind-expanding\" drug has been extensively discussed in the press and on television, and has been advocated in non-medical journals.After a similar interest in the non-medical uses of the drug and extensive self-medication by fringe groups in New York therc was a sudden upsurge of admissions to Bellevue Hospital with acute reactions from its use (Frosch et al., 1965).These fell into three groups: (1) acute panic reactions; (2) recurrence of symptoms while abstaining from the drug, which was more likely to occur after multiple ingestion; and (3) prolonged psychosis.Cases 1, 2, and 5 reported here appeared to be acute panic reactions, and Cases 3 and 4 a recurrence of symptoms in a period of abstinence.Case 4 also showed signs of a prolonged psychosis.Case 6 may have been due to disordered judge- ment or a psychotic reaction.Prolonged adverse reactions, including chronic hallucinatory states, also occur (Rosenthal, 1964).Owing to the fashion of using sugar cubes as a vehicle for black market L.S.D. it can also be taken accidentally-for example, by children-and three such cases have been reported.One of these sustained a dissociative state, accom- panied by anxiety and visual illusions, that lasted for several weeks (Cohen, 1966).Cases 5 and 6 show the need to look for L.S.D. and amphetamines at necropsy in deaths of this type, lest some be wrongly attributed to suicide.Despite the statements of the protagonists of the use of this drug that it is safe, L.S.D. can be dangerous when taken casually-for example, when not taken by selected patients under strict medical supervision and with the use of proper safeguards.The incidence of adverse effects associated with controlled use of the drug by physicians suggested that in medical hands it was an exceptionally safe drug (Levine and Ludwig, 1964). SummaryRecently there has been an increase in the use of lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide; L.S.D.) obtained illicitly.Adverse reactions are not uncommon, and six (two fatal) cases are reported.I am grateful to Professor F.

      "abstract": "The major concepts presented in this review can be summarized as follows: 1. There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories.

He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment.

The toxic dose is in the rage of the used as recreational. The worst risk of these drugs is due to the ignorance of the substances that are being taken, the dose given and' the variability of the individual response to them.

Other factors that may cause an influence in the damage caused are the surround of consume (closed locals, high temperature...) and the particular characteristics of the consumer. To all this it has to be added the increased risk of traffic accidents related with changes in concentration and perception (visual mainly) under their effects.

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome Without Overdose: Polypharmacy-Induced Toxicity in a Medically Stable Young Adult",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

In the elderly, it is more often a prolonged state of multifactorial origin: common precipitants include unsatisfactory housing, poverty, immobility, lack of cold awareness (autonomic neuropathy, dementia), drugs (sedatives, antidepressants), alcohol, acute confusion, hypothyroidism and infections....",

      "abstract": "Under certain conditions or in an overdose setting, several classes of drugs can induce illusions, hallucinations, or delusions. However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

      "abstract": "Article AbstractWithdrawal symptoms commonly occur during tapering and/or after discontinuation of antidepressant drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

We report a 38‐year‐old male worker with chronic toluene exposure who developed symptoms such as palpitation, insomnia, dizziness with headache, memory impairment, euphoria while working, and depression during the weekend. Upon cessation of exposure, follow‐up neurobehavioural tests, including the cognitive ability screening instrument and the mini‐mental state examination, gradually improved and eventually became normal. Although no further toluene exposure was noted, non‐specific symptoms reappeared whenever the subject smelled automotive exhaust fumes or paint, or visited a petrol station, followed by anxiety with sleep disturbance. During hospitalization for a toluene provocation test, there was no difference between pre‐challenge and post‐challenge PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2 or pulmonary function tests, except some elevation of pulse rate. The clinical manifestations suggested that MCS was more relevant to psychophysiological than pathophysiological factors.",

It provides enjoyable feelings which results in creating a strong urge to use the substances again and again. These drugs can cause physical dependence or psychological dependence or both. Over time, drug tolerance is produced which means to get the same effect more quantity of the drug is needed. These substances are very harmful physically, mentally, financially and socially too. If someone suddenly terminates using these substances after heavy or long term use, the body needs time to recover and number of withdrawal symptoms arises. These withdrawal symptoms can’t be treated by medications only but it needs counselling and support as well.

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction.

The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial irritation caused by infection or allergies. The instrumental learning appears to be related to the conditioning of certain emotional reactions (e.g. fear of separation, feeling of rejection). A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local irritation of bronchial mucosa, general state of child's health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states. In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or irritation, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.",

      "title": "Schizoaffective Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Febrile reactions have been observed after the administration of arsenical drugs, bismuth and, more recently, penicillin. The literature contains only brief comments concerning the incidence and severity of fever after the use of these drugs. Symptomatic Herxheimer reactions occur not only after the administration of spirocheticidal drugs but also during fever therapy (especially induced malaria). The variety of manifestations observed is related to the type of neurosyphilis. For example, in patients with dementia paralytica there may occasionally occur exacerbations of the existing psychoses or the development of new symptoms.

One valuable aspect of a definition of alcoholism is that it enables us to answer by scientific enquiry the question of whether or not it is an illness. The kind of disease which those alcoholics who support the disease concept have in mind is something which would describe a condition preceding their drinking, something constitutional, that is to say, present from their earliest days, and therefore likely to be in the nature of a biochemical or psychological abnormality. Alcohol is a drug, which induces dependence when used in certain minimal quantities and with a certain frequency of ingestion.",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

Self-medication of mood disorders with legal or illicit substances is highly prevalent. Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment. Many depressive symptoms may resolve with treatment of the substance use disorder. Independent mood disorders can be treated with behavioral therapy and standard pharmacological therapy. Some mood disorder medications are also effective for substance use disorders.

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

In the other possible scenario, the individual experiences a negative reaction to the stressor. Herein, at some point the person begins to exhibit behavioral, mood, or emotional symptoms, the person is then described as manifesting an adjustment disorder, and there is then the need to initiate change in order to restore even functioning. It is important to emphasize that adjustment disorders differ from acute stress disorders in that the latter represent reactions to extraordinary traumatic stressors (i.e., life‐threatening events).",

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

(1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations.

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

As a mood state, depression is characterized by feeling despondent or unhappy, while depression as a mood disorder is a persistent set of symptoms as described in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV). Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "title": "Lifestyle medicine for depression",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

A second problem is the probable, suspected or proven disposition to malignant hyperthermia in patients with other neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, severe rhabdomyolysis can be induced in myopathic muscle by the application of succinylcholine alone or in combination with inhalational anesthetics resulting in hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria and CK-elevation, sometimes followed by cardiac arrest. Cardiomyopathy is a common feature in many neuromuscular diseases. All cardiodepressant agents must be avoided. Specific problems with muscle relaxants arise in myasthenia gravis and in the myotonias. In the later stages of severe neuromuscular diseases the main problem concerning anesthesia is respiratory failure. The individual risk of every patient has to be evaluated before anesthesia.

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use. As physiological and psychological dependence progresses, an individual experiences negative reinforcement where substances primarily relieve dysphoria and unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

Hallucinations may occur in any sensory realm: auditory (hearing), visual (sight), olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile/kinesthetic (touch or bodily sensations). A clinician may hypothesize that a patient is hallucinating based on observations or descriptions of the person's behavior. Hallucinations and illusions most commonly occur in the auditory domain. Visual hallucinations and illusions may take many forms, including these: flashing lights in all or part of the field of vision; geometric patterns in all or part of the visual field; and so on. Hallucinations of taste (gustatory) or hallucinations of smell (olfactory) are most often of unpleasant sensations. Gustatory and olfactory hallucinations often correspond to disease in the temporal lobes of the brain. Tactile or kinesthetic hallucinations can take many forms.",

These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. [1] When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug.

Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects.DefinitionThe American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To quickly diagnose migraine without aura in a busy practice clinical in India and other developing countries. Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Neurally mediated syncope",
      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "title": "Co‐factors for smoking and evolutionary psychobiology",
      "abstract": "Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated in people with co-factors such as depression, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and bulimia/bingeing. These behavioral or cognitive patterns may be adaptive or neutral in the conditions under which we evolved but maladaptive in environments requiring alertness for extended periods, where a fully mobilized fight-or-flight response is inappropriate, and where food availability makes lack of an \"appestat\" a liability. Such conditions are amenable to management by nicotine because of its ability to produce small but reliable adjustments in relevant cognitive and behavioral functions. Moreover, symptomatology may be unmasked or exacerbated by nicotine abstinence, persisting beyond the usual time-course for nicotine withdrawal, which may explain the particular attraction of smoking and the difficulty these individuals experience in quitting without necessarily requiring that they be more nicotine-dependent. The implications are: (1) a better understanding of the evolutionary psychobiology of smoking may promote development of tailored interventions for smokers with co-factors; (2) nicotine may have therapeutic applications for non-smokers with co-factors; (3) because smoking has a fairly high heritability index, and because of evidence of assortative mating, special prevention efforts targeting children of smokers with co-factors, as well as early identification of the co-factor itself, may be needed.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse consists of the use by a subject without a medical recommendation, in quantities or with nonrecommended methods. Substance abuse also refers to their use in order to increase intellectual or physical performance, against the rules established by society. Substance abuse involves the chronic use of non-medical chemicals for hedonistic or entheogenic purposes [1]. Drugs such as alcohol, antidepressants, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, glue, cocaine, hallucinogens, metacular, narcotics, opiates, sedatives, stimulants and some organic solvents can be named [2]. Substance abuse can cause criminal or antisocial behavior, may generate long-term changes in personality [3]. Cocaine has major toxic effects on the body. Treatment of cocaine poisoning is complex. The main sales are those that can lead to patient death. For the proper treatment of any inoculation, it is necessary to identify the xenobiotic that generated it. The presence of metabolites, in the case of cocaine - ethylbenzoylcogene (EBE), provides information on the time of administration of the xenobiotic. Gas chromatography or liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is an optoelectronic method that can identify the presence of cocaine and / or EBE from biological samples. In order to increase the sensitivity of the method, a special mass metrology technique - MS/MS can be used [4, 5].",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

Les propriétés intrinsèques des molécules peuvent expliquer certaines manifestations. Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

      "abstract": "The clinicopathological conference is a time honoured exercise in which a participant is given a clinical protocol and tries to make a diagnosis. It has been variously lauded as an instructive teaching exercise or derided as an unreal situation.\r\n\r\nThe cases are often puzzling. What, for example, is one to make of a wasted man, deathly pale, with web-like thin hair, exaggerated sensitivity to noise, odours, light, or touch, where the course of the disease fluctuates with intermittent agitation or depression?\r\n\r\nOr what sudden epidemic illness would cause high fever, profuse generalised bleeding, and death within half an hour?\r\n\r\nAnd what about a dishevelled 39 year old man with a history of alcohol and possibly opiate use, presenting with lethargy and confusion but remaining afebrile, becoming delirious and combative, and dying within four days.\r\n\r\nThe first two cases, products of Edgar Allan Poe's lugubrious imagination, defy diagnosis. The symptoms of the cadaverous looking man in The Fall of the House of Usher have been attributed, perhaps not too convincingly, to acute intermittent porphyria (JAMA 1989;261: 863-4 [PubMed]). One can only speculate what might have caused the hideous pestilence with “sharp pains, sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution... the incidents of half an hour” (The Mask of the Red Death).\r\n\r\nFor the third case, a Dr Michael Benitez at one time suggested rabies. It is a case unsolved since 1849, when the patient boarded a train in Richmond, disappeared for five days, was found confused in a Baltimore tavern, dishevelled, in someone else's clothes, then taken to a city hospital, where he died delirious after several days. Delirium tremens, encephalitis, and malaria have been considered, but some think he was robbed and mugged. Others postulated that this being during an election, Poe (for it was the author himself) was drugged by a “repeater” gang and taken to vote at different polling booths, then abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere are further mysteries: firstly, the body was exhumed in 1875 and relocated, but there is speculation that the gravediggers dug up the wrong body; and secondly, for several years after 1949 an anonymous visitor would come on Poe's birthday and place a half bottle of Martel cognac on his grave.",

The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

In comparison to sober individuals, intoxicated people have a greater generic risk for being involved in hazardous activities that may result in fatal injuries. However, it is not clear whether the biological effects of acute alcohol intoxication result in worse injuries than those sustained by sober individuals who are injured by identical mechanisms. Alcohol intoxication has a neuroprotective effect in experimental animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) but the evidence for a similar effect in humans is controversial. Earlier studies found such a protective effect, but more recent large epidemiological studies have not confirmed this finding; some studies also suggest a dose-related protective or exacerbating effect of alcohol intoxication on TBI. There are two apparent alcohol-associated syndromes in which an otherwise survivable blunt force impact to the head of an intoxicated individual is fatal at the scene. The first is a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest (the so-called alcohol concussion syndrome or “commotio medullaris”); the second is “traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage” (secondary to tears in the cerebral arteries, particularly the intracranial and extracranial vertebral arteries).",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

These phenomena can occur shortly after patients have started to take antipsychotics, for some time or even for a long time after. Patients who choke frequently or take rapid, irregular breaths interspersed with groans or sighs need to be observed closely. Risk factors are high doses of and long-term use of antipsychotics. Clinical examination of the gag reflex and the respiration contributes very little to an unequivocal diagnosis of swallowing disorders. However, swallowing disorders can be identified reliably by means of videofluoroscopy.

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect.

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Occupational stress was perceived to be a problem only in jobs with high pressure and low pay, such as teaching and social services. Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "title": "Exertional Heat Illness during Training and Competition",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Exertional heat illness can affect athletes during high-intensity or long-duration exercise and result in withdrawal from activity or collapse during or soon after activity. These maladies include exercise associated muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, or exertional heatstroke. While certain individuals are more prone to collapse from exhaustion in the heat (i.e., not acclimatized, using certain medications, dehydrated, or recently ill), exertional heatstroke (EHS) can affect seemingly healthy athletes even when the environment is relatively cool. EHS is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 40°C accompanied by symptoms or signs of organ system failure, most frequently central nervous system dysfunction. Early recognition and rapid cooling can reduce both the morbidity and mortality associated with EHS. The clinical changes associated with EHS can be subtle and easy to miss if coaches, medical personnel, and athletes do not maintain a high level of awareness and monitor at-risk athletes closely. Fatigue and exhaustion during exercise occur more rapidly as heat stress increases and are the most common causes of withdrawal from activity in hot conditions. When athletes collapse from exhaustion in hot conditions, the term heat exhaustion is often applied. In some cases, rectal temperature is the only discernable difference between severe heat exhaustion and EHS in on-site evaluations. Heat exhaustion will generally resolve with symptomatic care and oral fluid support. Exercise associated muscle cramping can occur with exhaustive work in any temperature range, but appears to be more prevalent in hot and humid conditions. Muscle cramping usually responds to rest and replacement of fluid and salt (sodium). Prevention strategies are essential to reducing the incidence of EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping. INTRODUCTION This document replaces, in part, the 1996 Position Stand titled \"Heat and Cold Illnesses during Distance Running\" (9) and considers selected heat related medical conditions (EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping) that may affect active people in warm or hot environments. These recommendations are intended to reduce the morbidity and mortality of exertional heat-related illness during physical activity, but individual physiologic responses to exercise and daily health status are variable, so compliance with these recommendations will not guarantee protection. Heat illness occurs world wide with prolonged intense activity in almost every venue (e.g., cycling, running races, American football, soccer). EHS (1,27,62,64,65,109,132,154,160,164) and heat exhaustion (54,71,149,150) occur most frequently in hot-humid conditions, but can occur in cool conditions, during intense or prolonged exercise (133). Heat exhaustion and exercise related muscle cramps do not typically involve excessive hyperthermia, but rather are a result of fatigue, body water and/or electrolyte depletion, and/or central regulatory changes that fail in the face of exhaustion. This document will address recognition, treatment, and incidence reduction for heat exhaustion, EHS, and exercise associated muscle cramping, but does not include anesthesia-induced malignant hyperthermia, sunburn, anhidrotic heat exhaustion, or sweat gland disorders that are classified in other disease categories, because these disorders may or may not involve exercise or be solely related to heat exposure. Hyponatremia also occurs more frequently during prolonged activity in hot conditions, but is usually associated with excessive fluid intake and is addressed in the ACSM Exercise and Fluid Replacement Position Stand. Evidence statements in this document are based on the strength of scientific evidence with regard to clinical outcomes. Because research ethics preclude the use of human subjects in the study of EHS and other exertional heat illnesses, this document employs the following criteria: A, recommendation based on consistent and good-quality patient- or subject-oriented evidence; B, recommendation based on inconsistent or limited-quality patient- or subject-oriented evidence; C, recommendation based on consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, or a case series for studies of diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or screening. General Background: Exhaustion, Hyperthermia, and Dehydration Exhaustion is a physiologic response to work defined as the inability to continue exercise and occurs with heavy exertion in all temperature ranges. As ambient temperature increases beyond 20°C (68°F) and heat stress rises, the time to exhaustion decreases (58). From a clinical perspective it is difficult to distinguish athletes with exhaustion in cool conditions from those who collapse in hot conditions. Exercise that must be stopped due to exhaustion is likely triggered by some combination of hyperthermia-induced reduction of peripheral muscle activation due to decreased central activation (brain fatigue) (110,118), hydration level, peripheral effect of hyperthermia on muscle fatigue, depletion of energy stores, electrolyte imbalance, and/or other factors. Some combination of central, spinal cord, and peripheral responses to hyperthermia factor into the etiology of withdrawal or collapse from exhaustion during activity; the exact mechanisms have yet to be explained (90,114-116,171). The exercise-related exhaustion that occurs in hot conditions may be an extension of this phenomenon, but it is more pronounced, because depletion of energy stores occurs faster in hotter conditions, especially when athletes are not acclimatized to exercise in the heat (71). When physiologic exhaustion results in collapse, the clinical syndrome is often referred to as heat exhaustion. In both hot and cool environments, postexercise collapse also may be due to postural hypotension rather than heat exhaustion and postural changes usually resolve with leg elevation and rest in less than 30 min. There are several variables that affect exhaustion in athletes including duration and intensity of exercise, environmental conditions, acclimatization to exercise-heat stress, innate work capacity (V˙O2max), physical conditioning, hydration status, and personal factors like medications, supplements, sleep, and recent illness. In human studies of exercise time to exhaustion at a fixed exercise load, both individuals and groups show a decrease in exercise capacity (time to exhaustion) and an increase in perceived exertion as environmental temperature and/or relative humidity increase and/or as total body water decreases. The combined effects of heat stress and dehydration reduce exercise capacity and performance to a greater degree than either alone. Compared to more moderate conditions, an athlete in hot conditions must either slow the pace to avoid collapse or maintain the pace and risk collapse before the task is completed. Evidence statement. Dehydration reduces endurance exercise performance, decreases time to exhaustion, increases heat storage (11,12,16,41,57,141). Evidence category A. Exertional hyperthermia, defined as a core body temperature above 40°C (104°F) (71,85,86,149,150), occurs during athletic or recreational activity and is influenced by exercise intensity, environmental conditions, clothing, equipment, and individual factors. Hyperthermia occurs during exercise when muscle-generated heat accumulates faster than heat dissipates via increased sweating and skin blood flow (3). Heat production during intense exercise is 15-20 times greater than at rest, and can raise core body temperature by 1°C (1.8°F) every 5 min if no heat is removed from the body (105). Prolonged hyperthermia may lead to EHS, a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not promptly recognized and treated with body cooling. The removal of body heat is controlled by central nervous system (CNS) centers in the hypothalamus and spinal cord, and peripheral centers in the skin and organs. Heat flow to maintain a functional core temperature requires a temperature gradient from the body core to the body shell. If the skin temperature remains constant, the gradient increases as the core temperature increases during exercise, augmenting heat removal. If the shell or skin temperature also rises during exercise, as a result of either the environment or internal heat production, the core to skin gradient may be lost (i.e., reducing heat dissipation) and the core temperature increases. Wide variations of heat tolerance exist among athletes. The extent to which elevated body temperature below 40°C diminishes exercise performance and contributes to heat exhaustion (110) is unknown, but there is considerable attrition from exercise when rectal temperatures reach 39-40°C (144). In controlled laboratory studies, precooling the body will extend the time to exhaustion and preheating will shorten the time to exhaustion, but in both circumstances athletes tend to terminate exercise due to fatigue at a rectal temperature of about 40°C (104°F) (61). In recent years, the importance of hyperthermia in fatigue and collapse has been investigated. These studies have shown that the brain temperature is always higher than core temperature and heat removal is decreased in the hyperthermic brain compared to control (119). Also, as brain temperature increases from 37 to 40°C during exercise, cerebral blood flow and maximal voluntary muscular force output decrease with concurrent changes in brain wave activity and perceived exertion (110,118). Brain hyperthermia may explain why some exercising individuals collapse with exhaustion, while others are able to override central nervous system controls and push themselves to continue exercising strenuously and develop life-threatening EHS. It is not unusual for some athletes to experience prolonged hyperthermia without noticeable medical impairment, especially during competition. Elevated rectal temperatures up to 41.9°C (107.4°F) have been noted in soccer players, American football lineman, road runners, and marathoners who show no symptoms or signs of heat related physical changes (21,42,46,98,125,129,130,132,161,165,176). This is significant because some athletes tolerate rectal temperatures well above the widely accepted threshold for EHS of >40°C without obvious clinical sequelae (71,85,86,104,149,150). Dehydration occurs during prolonged exercise, more rapidly in hot environments when participants lose considerably more sweat than can be replaced by fluid intake (3,72,126). When fluid deficits exceed 3-5% of body weight, sweat production and skin blood flow begin to decline (19) reducing heat dissipation. Water deficits of 6-10% of body weight occur in hot weather, with or without clinically significant losses of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) (25,45,71,100,102,155,173) and reduce exercise tolerance by decreasing cardiac output, sweat production, and skin and muscle blood flow (12,41,57,71,101,141,142). Dehydration may be either a direct (i.e., heat exhaustion, exercise associated muscle cramps) or indirect (i.e., heatstroke) factor in heat illness (10). Excessive sweating also results in salt loss, which has been implicated in exercise associated muscle cramps and in salt loss hyponatremia during long-duration (>8 h) endurance events in the heat. In one study illustrating the cumulative affects of heat stress, a male soldier (32 yr, 180 cm, 110.47 kg, 41.4 mL·kg−1·min−1) participating in monitored, multiday, high-intensity exercise regimen at 41.2°C (106.0°F), 39% RH was asymptomatic with a postexercise rectal temperature of 38.3-38.9°C on days 3-7 (16). From the morning of day 5 to day 8, he lost 5.4 kg of body weight (4.8%) and had an increase of baseline heart rate, skin temperature and rectal temperature during days 6 and 7. On day 8, he developed heat exhaustion with unusual fatigue, muscular weakness, abdominal cramps, and vomiting with a rectal temperature of 39.6°C (103.3°F). His blood endorphin and cortisol levels were 6 and 2 times greater, respectively, than the other study subjects on day 8, indicating severe exercise-heat intolerance. Thirteen other males who maintained body weight near their prestudy baseline completed this protocol without incident. Because day-to-day dehydration affects heat tolerance, physical signs and hydration status should be monitored to reduce the incidence of heat exhaustion in hot environments. When humans exercise near maximal levels, splanchnic and skin blood flow decrease as skeletal muscle blood flow increases to provide plasma glucose, remove heat, and remove metabolic products from working muscles (70). As the central controls for blood flow distribution fatigue due to a core temperature increase, the loss of compensatory splanchnic and skin vasoconstriction results in reduction of the total vascular resistance and worsens cardiac insufficiency (71,84). The loss of splanchnic vasoconstriction during exhaustion has been reproduced in a laboratory rat model and supports the assertion that loss of splanchnic vasoconstriction plays a role in heat exhaustion in athletes (70,73,84). This mechanism partially explains why exertional collapse is less likely to occur in cool environments, where cool, vasoconstricted skin helps maintain both cardiac filling and mean arterial pressure, and prolongs the time to exhaustion. How EHS and heat exhaustion evolve, and in what sequence, are not completely understood (106). Some athletes tolerate hot conditions, dehydration, and hyperthermia well and are seemingly unaffected, while others discontinue activity in relatively less stressful conditions. The path that leads to EHS has been assumed to pass through heat exhaustion, however anecdotal and case study data seem to refute that notion as EHS can occur in relatively fresh athletes who develop symptomatic hyperthermia in 30-60 min of road racing in hot, humid conditions with no real signs of dehydration or heat exhaustion. If these athletes have heat exhaustion, then the duration and transition must be very short. Heat exhaustion should be protective for athletes in that, once exercise is stopped, the risk of developing exertional heat stroke is reduced because exercise-induced metabolic heat production decreases and heat dissipation to the environment increases. A program of prudent exercise in the heat along with acclimatization, improved cardiorespiratory physical fitness, and reasonable fluid replacement during exercise reduce the risk and incidence of both problems. Evidence statement. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is defined in the field by rectal temperature >40°C at collapse and by central nervous system changes. Evidence category B. EXERTIONAL HEAT ILLNESSES Exertional Heatstroke Etiology. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is defined by hyperthermia (core body temperature >40°C) associated with central nervous system disturbances and multiple organ system failure. When the metabolic heat produced by muscle during activity outpaces body heat transfer to the surroundings, the core temperature rises to levels that disrupt organ function. Almost all EHS patients exhibit sweat-soaked and pale skin at the time of collapse, as opposed to the dry, hot, and flushed skin that is described in the presentation of non-exertion-related (classic) heatstroke (162). Predisposing factors. Although strenuous exercise in a hot-humid environment, lack of heat acclimatization, and poor physical fitness are widely accepted as the primary factors leading to EHS, even highly trained and heat-acclimatized athletes develop EHS while exercising at a high intensity if heat dissipation is inadequate relative to metabolic heat production (18,34,71). The greatest risk for EHS exists when the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) exceeds 28°C (82°F) (20,81,156) during high-intensity exercise (>75% V˙O2max) and/or strenuous exercise that lasts longer than 1 h as outlined below in \"Monitoring the Environment.\" EHS also can occur in cool (8-18°C [45-65°F]) to moderate (18-28°C [65-82°F]) environments (14,56,132,133), suggesting that individual variations in susceptibility (14,22,55,56,66) may be due to inadequate physical fitness, incomplete heat acclimatization, or other temporary factors like viral illness or medications (81,133). Evidence statement. Ten to 14 days of exercise training in the heat will improve heat acclimatization and reduce the risk of EHS. Evidence category C. The risk of EHS rises substantially when athletes experience multiple stressors such as a sudden increase in physical training, lengthy initial exposure to heat, vapor barrier protective clothing, sleep deprivation (14), inadequate hydration, and poor nutrition. The cumulative effect of heat exposure on previous days raises the risk of EHS, especially if the ambient temperature remains elevated overnight (14,168). Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements containing ephedrine, synephrine, ma huang and other sympathomimetic compounds may increase heat production (23,121), but require verification as a cause of hyperthermia by controlled laboratory studies or field trials. Appropriate fluid ingestion before and during exercise minimizes dehydration and reduces the rate at which core body temperature rises (46,60). However, hyperthermia may occur in the absence of significant dehydration when a fast pace or high-intensity exercise generates more metabolic heat than the body can remove (18,34,165). Skin disease (i.e., miliaria rubra), sunburn, alcohol use, drug abuse (i.e., ecstasy), antidepressant medications (69), obesity, age >40 yr, genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia, and a history of heat illness also have been linked to an increased risk of EHS in athletes (14,55,85,150). Athletes should not exercise in a hot environment if they have a fever, respiratory infection, diarrhea, or vomiting (14,81). A study of 179 heat casualties at a 14-km race over 9 yr showed that 23% reported a recent gastrointestinal or respiratory illness (128). A similar study of 10 military patients with EHS reported that three had a fever and six recalled at least one warning sign of impending illness prior to collapse (14). In American football, EHS usually occurs during the initial 4 d of preseason practice, which for most players takes place during the hottest and most humid time of the summer when athletes are the least fit. This emphasizes the importance of gradually introducing activity to induce acclimatization, carefully monitoring changes in behavior or performance during practices, and selectively modifying exercise (i.e., intensity, duration, rest periods) in high-risk conditions. Three factors may influence the early season EHS risk in American football players: (a) failure of coaches to adjust the intensity of the practice to the current environmental conditions, following the advice of the sports medicine staff; (b) unfit and unacclimatized players practicing intensely in the heat; and (c) vapor barrier equipment introduced before acclimatization. One study of 10 EHS cases (14) reported that eight incidents occurred during group running at a 12.1-13.8 km·h−1 pace in environmental temperatures of ≥25°C (77°F), suggesting that some host factor altered exercise-heat tolerance on the day that EHS occurred. Heat tolerance is often less in individuals who have the lowest maximal aerobic power (i.e., V˙O2max ≤ 40 mL·kg−1·min−1) (14,64,96). To maintain pace when running in a group, these less fit individuals must function at higher exercise intensities to maintain the group's pace and are likely to have higher rectal temperatures at the end of a run compared to individuals with a higher V˙O2max. Air flow and heat dissipation also are reduced for runners in a pack. More clinical and scientific reports of EHS involve males, and some hypotheses have been advanced (14). First, men may simply be in more EHS prone situations (i.e., military combat and American football). Second, men may be predisposed because of gender-specific hormonal, physiological, psychological, or morphological (i.e., muscle mass, body surface area-to-mass ratio) differences. Women, however, are not immune to the disorder, and the number of women who experience EHS may rise with the increased participation of women in strenuous sports. Evidence statement. The following conditions increase the risk of EHS: obesity, low physical fitness level, lack of heat acclimatization, dehydration, a previous history of EHS, sleep deprivation, sweat gland dysfunction, sunburn, viral illness, diarrhea, or certain medications. Evidence category B. Physical training, cardiorespiratory fitness, and heat acclimatization reduce the risk of EHS. Evidence category C. Pathophysiology. The underlying pathophysiology of EHS occurs when internal organ tissue temperatures rise above critical levels, cell membranes are damaged, and cell energy systems are disrupted, giving rise to a characteristic clinical syndrome (56,149). As a cell is heated beyond its thermal threshold (i.e., about 40°C), a cascade of events occurs that disrupts cell volume, metabolism, acid-base balance, and membrane permeability leading initially to cell and organ dysfunction and finally to cell death and organ failure (71,91,175). This complex cascade of events explains the variable onset of brain, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and muscle dysfunction among EHS patients. The extent of multisystem tissue morbidity and the mortality rate are directly related to the area in degree-minutes under the body core temperature vs. time graph and the length of time required to cool central organs to <40°C (14,20,47,48). Tissue thresholds and the duration of temperature elevation, rather than the peak core body temperature, determine the degree of injury (72). When cooling is rapidly initiated and both the body temperature and cognitive function return to the normal range within an hour of onset of symptoms, most EHS patients recover fully (47,48). EHS victims who are recognized and cooled immediately theoretically tolerate about 60°C·min (120°F·min; area under the cooling curve) above 40.5°C without lasting sequelae (see Fig. 1). Conversely, athletes with EHS who go unrecognized or are not cooled quickly, and have more than 60°C·min of temperature elevation above 40.5°C, tend to have increased morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of 20 \"light\" and 16 \"severe\" cases of EHS during military training (150) showed that coma was relatively brief in light cases when hyperthermia was limited to <1 h, despite evidence of multiple organ involvement that was confirmed with elevated serum muscle and liver enzymes (74,172). Severe EHS cases were moribund at the time of admission and died early with evident central nervous system damage (150). The primary difference between light and severe EHS cases appears to be the length of time between collapse and the initiation of cooling therapy (14,20,47,48).FIGURE 1: Cooling curves for early and late cooling interventions. The area under the early intervention curve above 40.5°C (the dashed line) in degree-minutes is approximately 60 while the area under the late intervention curve (cooling at 50 min) is >145. The prognosis based on area under the cooling curve for the late intervention is poor. Cooling can be delayed when heat stoke is not recognized early in the evaluation or if the athlete is transported before cooling is initiated. The arrow marks the start of cooling at 10 min for early intervention and 50 min for late intervention.Hyperthermia of heart muscle tissue directly suppresses cardiac function, but the dysfunction is reversible with body cooling, as demonstrated by echocardiography (133). Cardiac tissue hyperthermia reduces cardiac output, oxygen delivery to tissues, and the vascular transport of heat from deep tissues to the skin. Cardiac insufficiency or failure associated with hyperthermia accelerates the elevation of core temperature and increases tissue hypoxia, metabolic acidosis and organ dysfunction. The concurrent heating of the brain begins a cascade of cerebral and hypothalamic failure that also accelerates cell death by disrupting the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow. Interestingly, direct hyperthermia-induced brain dysfunction may lead to collapse that can be \"lifesaving,\" if stopping exercise allows the body to cool or the collapse triggers medical evaluation that leads to cooling therapy. Exercise stimulates increased blood flow to working muscle. During a maximal effort, for example, approximately 80-85% of maximal cardiac output is distributed to active muscle tissue (139). As core temperature increases during exercise, the thermoregulatory response increases peripheral vasodilatation and blood flow to the cutaneous vascular beds to augment body cooling. The brain also regulates blood pressure during exercise by decreasing blood flow to splanchnic organs. This decreased intestinal blood flow limits vascular heat exchange in the gut and promotes bowel tissue hyperthermia and ischemia. Gut cell membrane breakdown allows lipopolysaccharide fragments from intestinal gram-negative bacteria to leak into the systemic circulation, increasing the risk of endotoxic shock. Dehydration can accentuate these effects on the GI tract and speed the process. Rhabdomyolysis, the breakdown of muscle fibers, occurs in EHS as muscle tissue exceeds the critical temperature threshold of cell membranes (i.e., about 40°C). Although eccentric and concentric muscle overuse is a common cause of rhabdomyolysis, muscle membrane permeability increases due to hyperthermia and occurs earlier in exercise when the muscle tissues are hyperthermic (71,74). As heat decomposes cell membranes, myoglobin is released and may cause renal tubular toxicity and obstruction if renal blood flow is inadequate. Intracellular potassium is also released into the extracellular space, increasing serum levels and potentially inducing cardiac arrhythmias. Heating renal tissue above its critical threshold can directly suppress renal function and induce acute renal failure that is worsened by sustained hypotension, crystallization of myoglobin, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the metabolic acidosis associated with exercise (31,70,153). Incidence. The incidence of EHS varies from event to event and increases with rising ambient temperature and relative humidity. Limited data exist regarding the incidence of EHS during athletic activities. While fatal outcomes are often reported in the press, there is limited reporting of non fatal EHS unless it involves high profile athletes. In most cases, fatal EHS is a rare event that strikes \"at random\" in sports like American football, especially during the initial four days of preseason conditioning, where the incidence of fatal EHS was about 1 in 350,000 participants from 1995 through 2002 (131). Fatal EHS in American football players often occurs when air temperature is 26-30°C (78-86°F) and relative humidity is 50-80% (87). EHS is observed more often during road racing and other activities that involve continuous, high-intensity exercise. The Twin Cities Marathon, which is run in cool conditions, averages <1 EHS per 10,000 finishers (136); this incidence rises as the WBGT rises. In contrast, one popular 11.5-km road race, staged in hot and humid summer conditions (WBGT 21-27°C), averages 10-20 EHS cases per 10,000 entrants (18,34). The same race course, run in cool conditions, had no cases of EHS (A Crago, M.D., personal communication). Such a high incidence burdens the medical care system and suggests that the summer event is not scheduled at the safest time for the runners. Recognition. Immediate recognition of EHS cases is paramount to survival (68). The appearance of signs and symptoms depends on the degree and duration of hyperthermia (14,48,71,81,150). The symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and include disorientation, confusion, dizziness, irrational or unusual behavior, inappropriate comments, irritability, headache, inability to walk, loss of balance and muscle function resulting in collapse, profound fatigue, hyperventilation, vomiting, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, or coma. Thus, any change of personality or performance should trigger an assessment for EHS, especially in hot-humid conditions. In collision sports like American football, EHS has been initially mistaken for concussion; among nonathletes, EHS also has been initially misdiagnosed as psychosis. A body core temperature estimate is vital to establishing an EHS diagnosis, and rectal temperature should be measured in any athlete who collapses or exhibits signs or symptoms consistent with EHS. Ear (aural canal or tympanic membrane), oral, skin over the temporal artery, and axillary temperature measurements should not be used to diagnose EHS because they are spuriously lowered by the temperature of air, skin, and liquids that contact the skin (18,134,135). Oral temperature measurements also are affected by hyperventilation, swallowing, ingestion of cold liquids, and face fanning (33,151). At the time of collapse, systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg, tachycardia, hyperventilation, and a shocklike appearance (i.e., sweaty, cool skin) are common. Evidence statement. Ear (i.e., aural), oral, skin, temporal, and axillary temperature measurements should not be used to diagnose or distinguish EHS from exertional heat exhaustion. Evidence category B. Early symptoms of EHS include clumsiness, stumbling, headache, nausea, dizziness, apathy, confusion, and impairment of consciousness (71,85,149,161). Evidence category B. Treatment. EHS is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate whole body cooling for a satisfactory outcome (14,44,48,72,82,85,120,132,149). Cooling should be initiated and, if there are no other life-threatening complications, completed on-site prior to evacuation to the hospita",

Anxiety sensitivityAnxiety sensitivity (AS) refers to individual differences in the fear of anxietyrelated sensations and the expectation that such sensations can have harmful consequences (Reiss, 1997;Reiss & McNally, 1985).Just as some people are afraid of spiders, some individuals fear the sensations that accompany anxiety.This construct AS can be measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) (Peterson & Reiss, 1992;Reiss, Peterson, Gursky, & McNally, 1986).AS has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders, specifically PD (Reiss, 1991).Besides AS, trait anxiety is also regarded as a vulnerability factor for the de- Chapter 2Reactivity to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy first-degree relatives of patients with panic disorder Background: The effects of a 35% CO2 challenge were examined in healthy firstdegree relatives of panic disorder patients and in healthy control subjects matched for age and gender.Methods: One single inhalation of a 35% CO2 / 65% O2 challenge was administered to 50 first-degree relatives of panic disorder patients and 50 control subjects.Results: The first-degree relatives were more reactive to the 35% CO2 challenge than the control subjects.Conclusions: These findings indicate that being a member of a family with a panic disorder patient is, in itself, an important factor in CO2 hypersensitivity among subjects who have never experienced a panic attack.Both panic disorder patients and their first-degree relatives have a tendency to be more reactive to the CO2 challenge.van Beek, N., & Griez, E.

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area.

The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

Addiction or psychological dependence implies the compulsive self-administration of the drug, caused by both its reinforcing or rewarding effects and the unpleasant experience (i.e., abstinence syndrome) produced by the sudden interruption of its consumption. In contrast to tolerance or physical dependence, addiction is not simply a biological phenomenon. Psychological, environmental, and social factors can strongly influence its development. All these factors could explain the important variability of the clinical syndrome of addiction, and the various approaches that have been proposed to help addicts to stop their drug use. Nevertheless, these methods do not work equally well for all types of addicts.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued. Drugs such as the benzodiazepines (or phenobarbital)",

      "abstract": "Both depression and conduct disorders are relatively prevalent and are related to poor long-term outcomes. Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

In addition, other variables (e.g., genetics) could account for the comorbidity/smoking association. What we need to know: how strong and consistent are comorbidity/smoking associations?

Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

      "title": "[Transient amnesia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "The two main aetiologies of transient amnesia in the elderly are idiopathic transient global amnesia (TGA) and iatrogenic or toxic amnesia. Vascular and epileptic amnesia are less common. According to the literature, transient psychogenic amnesia, which is a frequent cause of amnesia at age 30 to 50, is very rare in the elderly. TGA is the prototypical picture of transient amnesia. It occurs more often after age 50, with no identified cause, even if some authors accept emotional stress or minor head trauma as occasional precipitants. The mechanism of TGA remains a matter of discussion. It may be the consequence of a spreading depression similar to that described in migraine with aura, but other arguments support an ischemic mechanism. Iatrogenic amnesias are mainly caused by benzodiazepines (BZs) or anticholinergics. The former may occur in a non-anxious subject, who is not a usual consumer of BZ and takes a single dose. The latter are more often due to a hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, in particular in patients presenting with a covert, incipient Alzheimer's disease. A vascular origin must be considered when amnesia is accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and when the regression of the amnesic disorder is slow, lasting several days. It results from lesions involving various mechanisms and locations, mainly subcortical. Partial seizures, most often mesio-temporal, more rarely frontal, may be the cause of transient amnesia in the elderly, in the absence of a past history of epilepsy. The red flag supportive of an epileptic origin is the repetition of stereotyped amnesic episodes. EEG demonstration of seizures may be difficult and the response to antiepileptic drugs effective on partial seizures is usually good.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

A toxic agent as cause for the health impairment is often not identified during the early stage, especially if oral exposure is causing the mass poisoning. The toxicity of sources can be inherent to the agent itself (e.g. toxic fungi, ethanol and recreational drugs) or be the result of contamination (e.g. toxins from microorganisms or nitrate in food, heavy metals in drinking water). Most mass poisonings are unintended. However, there have also been many incidents reported in the past where mass poisoning was the result of intentional action. Examples are the debasement of food, falsification of alcoholic beverages with methanol, medical drug fraud or “stretching” of drugs with agents showing higher toxicity than the drug itself. The chapter gives an overview of typical and extraordinary scenarios and describes the most important aspects of treatment of mass poisoning, mainly caused by oral exposures.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

A mild degree of nerve irritation is not rare after the administration of a series of doses of neo-arsphenamin, resulting in the development of numbness and formication in the extremities. The reason that these symptoms appear more frequently after neo-arsphenamin than after arsphenamin in all probability is that the former is a less stable preparation, varies more in the different laboratories in which it is made, and is much more readily subject to oxidation on shaking or exposure to the air.

      "title": "Sensitization to Drugs",
      "abstract": "The word “sensitization” is used to refer to a number of different but related effects. For example, in immunology, sensitization refers to the hypersensitivity to an antigen (often an allergen) that can develop upon repeated exposure to the antigen. In the study of learning, sensitization refers to a form of nonassociative learning whereby exposure to a stimulus (an unconditional stimulus, US) increases subsequent responsiveness to the same or other stimuli, even though they were not explicitly paired. Similarly, in pharmacology, the word sensitization has come to refer to an increase in a drug effect upon successive exposures to a drug or hypersensitivity to a drug in animals that were exposed to the drug in the past (Fig. 1). For example, one unconditional effect of drugs such as amphetamine or cocaine is to produce psychomotor activation, often measured as an increase in forward locomotion. Under some circumstances, the repeated administration of psychostimulant drugs results in a progressive increase in this drug effect, whereby successive injections of the same dose produce greater and greater psychomotor activation. Furthermore, exposure to one drug (e.g., amphetamine) can also render animals hypersensitive to the locomotor-activating effects of other drugs (e.g., cocaine or morphine). When exposure to one drug (or another stimulus, such as stress) renders an animal hypersensitive to another drug or stimulus, this is called “cross-sensitization” (Kalivas and Barnes 1988; Robinson and Becker 1986; Stewart and Badiani 1993).",

The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

The drug is related to a certain youth culture from which it is estimated that many drug abusers have been recruited. The desired effects of ecstasy, namely enhanced openness, awareness and empathy, have previously been used in various therapeutic connections. In later years the drug has led to abuse which, in connection with certain cultural behaviour patterns (for example in discotheques), can cause dangerous psychiatric as well as somatic effects. The undesirable psychiatric effects range from fear through depression to actual psychoses, and the somatic effects vary from symptoms of increased sympathetic activity to malignant hyperthermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and lethal hepatotoxicity.

      "abstract": "Abstract The incidence of sedation-related adverse events depends on the medications administered, the characteristics of the procedure, and preexisting patient factors. Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them. These “minor” events can still progress to more significant harm.",

While a person who was intoxicated may not be able to form the requisite specific intent to commit some offences, voluntary intoxication usually disentitles a person from an insanity or \"mental impairment\" defence. However, a person may also consume alcohol or use a substance without becoming intoxicated and the presence of alcohol, substances or metabolites of substances in a person's urine or blood is not conclusive when the question of intoxication is relevant. A jury (or a judge sitting without a jury) may require expert opinion evidence when cannabis or methamphetamine intoxication are implicated in the alleged offending.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Individuals suffering from drug addiction may also manifest features of bipolar spectrum disorders. Hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments may render individuals vulnerable to later development of substance abuse. Bipolar disorders themselves may be altered or precipitated by substance use, most notably by stimulants (amphetamines), alcohol, and cannabinoids.The clinical usefulness of mood stabilizers, particularly antiepileptics, has been established as safe and effective in substance abusers with and without comorbid mood disorders. Most studies on this issue have been of short duration and focused on the resolution of a currently manifest period of illness. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of these drugs on the long-term longitudinal course of these diseases, such as frequently encountered recurrent relapses into states of agitation, impulsivity, and/or dissatisfaction. As opposed to the clinical experience with traditional antidepressants and neuroleptics, antiepileptics do not induce counter-polar states (depressed patients abruptly turning manic or hypomanic; nor patients currently hypomanic or manic turning abruptly depressed). Many clinicians consider antiepileptic mood stabilizers to be the preferred category of medications for the treatment of such patients. Valproate appears to be a potentially fruitful medication to study in these dual diagnosis patients due to preliminary evidence demonstrating its anticraving efficacy.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium.

      "title": "A Review of Addiction",
      "abstract": "Addiction to drugs and alcohol is often undiagnosed and untreated. Physicians are often unaware or have negative attitudes regarding these patients, such as the perception that treatment is ineffective. Addiction--psychological dependence with or without tolerance and withdrawal--is essentially compulsive uncontrolled substance use despite physical, psychological, or social consequences. We now have an understanding of the 2 major neurological pathways involved in addiction. First, the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, which is essential for survival, can be physically altered by drug abuse to result in uncontrolled cravings. Second, the decision-making prefrontal cortex, which suppresses inappropriate reward response, can also be altered by drug abuse. Thus, accelerated \"go\" signals and impaired \"stop\" signals result in uncontrolled use despite severe consequences. Further, addicts can be predisposed to addiction by genetic defects in reward pathway neurotransmission and stress-related developmental brain abnormalities. Relapse to drug use can occur because of stress or cue-related reward pathway stimulation or even by a single drug dose. Individualized treatment of addiction, including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral interventions, can be as successful as treatment of other chronic diseases. Several pharmaceuticals are available or under study for these disorders. Waiting for the addict to \"be ready\" for treatment can be dangerous and detoxification alone is often ineffective. The physician's role in treating addiction includes prevention, diagnosis, brief intervention, motivational interviewing, referral, and follow-up care. An understanding of the biological reality of addiction allows physicians to understand addicts as having a brain disease. Further, the reality of effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for addiction allows physicians to be more optimistic in treating addicts. The challenge to the physician is to embrace the reality of addictive disease and fulfill his or her role in its treatment.",

      "title": "Cytokines as a Precipitant of Depressive Illness: Animal and Human Studies",
      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

An estimated 1.8 million Americans are current nonmedical users of sedatives. Many sedatives act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, producing depressed cortical function and disinhibition. Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Patients can be withdrawn with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital; inpatient treatment may be required for severe use disorder or withdrawal. There are few data on the long-term treatment of sedative use disorders.",

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

      "title": "The Adverse Psychiatric Consequences of Recreational Stimulant Drugs Such as Methamphetamine, Cocaine, Ecstasy/mdma, and Mephedrone: a Unified Psychobiological Explanation.",
      "abstract": "Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine, nicotine and Ecstasy/MDMA, are taken for positive reasons such as mood enhancement. Yet their repetitive use can lead to a range of psychobiological deficits and psychiatric distress. There are several underlying neurobiological factors for this. Their acute subjective effects are typically positive, with greater alertnessand emotional engagement. However during the post-drug recovery period the opposite states predominate, with feeling of tiredness and sadness. Every recreational central nervous system (CNS) stimulant drug causes this mood fluctuation. They are most evident in drugs with a very rapid onset and come-down, such as cocaine or nicotine. Hence regular smokers report good moods immediately after smoke inhalation, followed by poor moods 30-60 minutes later. This rapidity of these mood changes with nicotine and cocaine, helps explain why they are also the most addictive. Parallel fluctuations occur across many other psychological functions, with impoverished cognitive skills when off-drug. CNS stimulant drugs also adversely affect the HPA axis, impairing sleep and disrupting homeostasis. These core psychobiological problems help explain their adverse psychiatric effects, since fluctuating mood states and disrupted homeostatic stability, can exacerbate any prior psychiatric susceptibilities (for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, or other disorders). In summary, the repetitive stimulation of the CNS by recreational drugs can be very damaging to the organism, both acutely and chronically.",

It is usual to associate a benzodiazepin with an opioid, more often Midazolam and Morphine or Fentanyl; other drugs as Propofol, Clonidine and Ketamine have specific indications, brief painful procedures and weaning from long periods of sedation to avoid withdrawal. Sometimes it can be useful to add a neuromuscular blocking agent to help mechanical ventilation.

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "abstract": "On a regular basis, the media presents the potential risks of the use of psycho-active compounds, including misused pharmaceuticals (flunitrazepam, GHB) or drugs of abuse (cannabis, LSD, ecstasy). Ethanol is also frequently encountered. These drugs can be used for recreational purposes by addicts or can be observed after sexual assaults (drugs spiked in food). Forensic toxicology can be involved in several situations to document impairment, such as: crime under influence, date rape, driving under influence, psychiatric disorders, determination of the cause of death... In some particular situations, it can be very cautious to investigate exposure to psycho-active drugs, due to late sampling of biological specimens. To enhance the window of detection of 3 specific drugs, the authors propose the following: 1. Use of an ultra-sensitive technique, such as GC/MS/MS/NCI for 7-aminoflunitrazepam; 2. Use of a cumulative specimen, such as sweat for GHB and 3. Use of a metabolite with a long half-life, such as ethyl glucuronide for ethanol.",

      "abstract": "Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is a rare and underreported phenomenon. When patients ingest large amounts of cocaine, patients can experience seizures. Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "abstract": "Medication adherence is increasingly being recognized as a significant issue in treating geriatric patients. A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy.

A challenge faced in many acute drug overdoses is determining the agents taken and possible adulterants or contaminants. Chronic misuse can lead to dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. ■ Substance use disorder is a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress within a 12-month period.

Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

These are chemicals that are capable of inducing profound changes in the state of consciousness, with altered perception and strange illusions. The drug state has been likened by some to a mystical experience but viewed by others as a form of psychosis—hence the alternative term psychotomimetic to describe these drugs. This is a diverse group of drugs whose effects are not all identical, but to be included in this class, the following criteria should be fulfilled: 1) The main effect is on thought, perception, and mood. 2) There is only minimal intellectual or memory impairment. 3) Stupor or psychostimulation is not an integral part of the drug action. 4) Autonomic side effects are not disabling. 5) There is little or no dependence liability.",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation for dystonia",
      "abstract": "The term 'dystonia' refers to a clinical syndrome of involuntary and repetitive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and body postures. The most common classification of dystonia is based on the three axes: etiology; age of disease onset; and distribution of affected body regions. The etiology of dystonia may be primary or secondary to an acquired cause (e.g., a hypoxic brain injury). Secondary dystonias are typically not 'pure' dystonias, but are accompanied by other neurological signs and symptoms. Exceptions are acute dystonic reactions or tardive dystonia (TD) caused by the acute or chronic use of antidopaminergic drugs, which are pure and clinically indistinguishable from primary dystonias. Primary dystonias may be accompanied by Parkinsonism or myoclonus only and are termed 'dystonia plus' syndromes in these cases. A genetic cause has been identified in an increasing number of primary dystonias or dystonia-plus syndromes. These monogenic forms are referred to as DYT1 to DYT20 (for a review see [1]). The severity and distribution of dystonia is linked to age with a greater tendency to develop generalized dystonia with an early onset (below 26 years of age) versus a late onset (>26 years of age). The distribution of dystonia can be described as focal (only a single body region affected), segmental (two adjacent body parts affected), multifocal (several noncontiguous parts affected), generalized or hemidystonia (one body half affected). The three diagnostic axes help to characterize clinically distinct forms of dystonia with a particular cause and prognosis; for example, early onset primary focal dystonia tends to generalize rapidly, can lead to severe physical disability and is often monogenic (e.g., DYT1 or DYT6), whereas the more prevalent adult-onset focal dystonias show little progression and are mostly sporadic.",

After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9.

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Des jeunes adultes masculins en bonne santé ont été exposés à un mélange de 22 composés organiques volatiles (VOC) d'une concentration de 25mg par m 3 , la plus élevée qui ait été trouvée dans des logements neufs. Une telle concentration équivant à environ 7ppm de toluène. Ce mélange n'a pas de conséquences sur les performances à une batterie neurocomportementale à large champ d'investigation, mais provoque les symptômes classiques du mal des immeubles: l'irritation des yeux et de la gorge, des céphalées et de la fatigue. L'échec de la mise en évidence de déficits fonctionnels pourrait étre dûà plusieurs facteurs: (1) les tests neurocomportementaux peuvent ne pas avoir été assez sensibles ou assez difficiles pour détecter des effets; (2) les jeunes adultes masculins en bonne santé sont sans doute, dans la population générale, les moins sujects à présenter une détérioration des performances. D'autres études s'imposent si l'on veut savoir qui est le plus vulnérable à l'exposition aux basses concentrations de solvants; (3) finalement, les associations de VOC à faible densité peuvent bien ne pas être neurotoxiques. D'autres cibles physiologiques, telles que la réponse inflammatoire et les fonctions pulmonaires, doivent être explorées. Assessment of sensory irritant and neurobehavioural effects of exposure to complex solvent mixtures poses a variety of methodological challenges, particularly at the low levels typically found in new buildings. Healthy young adult males were exposed to a 25mg/m 3 mixture of 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) representative of the highest concentration found in new homes. This concentration is equivalent to about 7ppm toluene. This mixture produced no consistent effects on performance of an extensive neurobehavioural battery, but did elicit classical “sick building syndrome” (SBS) symptoms of eye and throat irritation, headache and fatigue. Failure to find functional deficits could be due to several factors: (1) The neurobehavioural tests may not have been sensitive (or difficult) enough to detect effects; (2) healthy young adult males are probably the least likely subset of the general population to show performance decrements. Further study is needed to determine which subsets are most vulnerable to low‐level solvent exposure; (3) finally, low‐level VOC mixtures may not be neurotoxic. Other physiological endpoints (e. g. inflammatory response and pulmonary function), need to be explored.",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

Other agents are responsible for drop of arterial pressure by changing position, including antihypertensive drugs, alpha-blocking agents used in urology, antipsychotics, cyclic antidepressants, vasodilators and nitrates, dopaminergic antiparkinson drugs, sedatives, etc. Only drug with true ototoxic properties will be discussed here, namely substances that are able to damage the inner ear (cochlear or vestibular damage) or the VIIIth cranial nerve, causing impairment of equilibrium and/or (most often) hearing. No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol and illicit drug use and associated problems within the adolescent population continue to be a great concern. Accidental death and injury in this age group frequently is alcohol- or drug-related. Venturesomeness and impulsiveness combined with alcohol can produce disastrous results. Alcohol use is more likely to cause an adolescent to be sexually irresponsible, which can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. There has been an alarming growth in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive rates recently among the adolescent population. Finally, teenagers who abuse alcohol are more likely to drop out of school, thus damaging their long-term employment prospects. Definition The American Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) defines alcohol dependence, a substance use disorder, as a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by three of the following seven symptoms occurring during the same 12-month period: tolerance; withdrawal; use greater than intended; inability to cease use; time-consuming activities associated with use; social, occupational, or recreational dysfunction; and continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems. Abuse is defined as one or more of the following: failure to fulfill major roles at home or school, recurrent use in hazardous situations, recurrent legal problems, and use despite persistent social or interpersonal problems.",

      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both.

Accidental poisoningThis is usually a problem of the young child or toddler, with a mean age of presentation of 2.5 years.Accidental poisoning usually occurs when the child is unsupervised, and there is an increased incidence in poisoning following recent disruption in households, such as a new baby, moving house or where there is maternal depression. Intentional overdoseSuicide or parasuicide attempts are usually made by young people in their teens; however, sometimes they may be as young as 8 or 9 years old.These children or adolescents should undergo psychiatric and social assessment. Drug abuseAlcohol and solvent abuse are among the commonest forms of drug abuse in children. Iatrogenic drugsThe commonest offender is diphenoxylate with atropine (Lomotil).This combination is toxic to some children at therapeutic doses.The most frequently fatal drug is digoxin. Deliberate poisoningRarely, symptoms are induced in children by adults via the administration of drugs.A history of poisoning will often not be given at presentation. F.2 Primary assessment and resuscitation in poisoningz Respiratory rate: the rate may be increased in poisoning from amphetamines, ecstasy, salicylates, ethylene glycol and methanol z Acidotic sighing respirations: this may suggest metabolic acidosis from salicylates or ethylene glycol poisoning as a cause for the coma z Heart rate: tachycardia is caused by amphetamines, ecstasy, β-agonists, phenothiazines, theophylline and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); bradycardia is caused by β-blockers, digoxin and organophosphates z Blood pressure: hypotension is commonly seen in serious poisoning; hypertension is caused by ecstasy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors z If heart rate is above 200 beats/min in an infant or above 150 beats/min in a child, or if the rhythm is abnormal, perform cardiac monitoring.QRS prolongation and ventricular tachycardia are seen in TCA poisoning z Depression of conscious level suggests poisoning with opiates, sedatives (such as benzodiazepines), antihistamines and hypoglycaemic agents z Pupillary size and reaction should be noted.Very small pupils suggest opiate or organophosphate poisoning; large pupils suggest amphetamines, atropine and TCAs 10.",

There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of alcoholism in the elderly population are tendentially underestimated. There are some reasons for this fact. The pathway to the diagnosis of alcoholism may be considerably compromised in the often comorbid or multimorbid patient. To live up to an advanced age seems to be a good argument against chronic substance abuse. Elderly people and their relatives are often still more reluctant to report about socially stigmatizing disorders. On top of that, the amount of social control is reduced after the end of employment and upon entering retirement. Yet, if alcohol-withdrawal symptoms occur, e.g., following an admission of the addicted patient to a hospital, the missed diagnosis of alcoholism means a delay of the correct interpretation of such complications and of the necessary treatment. Aged patients with reduced physical and mental reserve capacity are at special risk of developing further serious complications. Progressive, sometimes irreversible decay of the cognitive functions in long lasting delirious states or, as an aftermath of withdrawal, epileptic seizures are of particular importance.",

In contrast, a stuporous patient responds to a vigorous and continuous stimulus only, and upon discontinuation of a stimulus returns to an unresponsive state. Coma is a state of complete unresponsiveness, from which a patient cannot be aroused.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

These difficulties are due to spending time in a cramped environment with little opportunity for exercise, altered (and often unpalatable) food, and dehydration. Delays and detours during the journey, and possible difficulties after reaching one's final destination after the journey, are likely to exacerbate the problem, as is the dry and slightly hypoxic air in the cabin when the journey is by plane. It has been suggested that the risk of deep-vein thrombosis is also increased in these circumstances, although the extent to which dehydration, lack of activity, and hypoxia are individually or collectively responsible is unclear.13-22If the number of time zones that has been crossed is small (less than three), travel fatigue is the only problem, jet lag (see below) being absent. The symptomsare transitory and can quickly be remedied on arrival at the final destination. Important measures include rehydration (water and fruit juices, not tea or alcohol which promote urine loss), a rest or short nap, some light physical activity, and a shower. Some of these measures (brief bouts of exercise and drinking to minimize dehydration) can be practised also during the journey. Any nap that is taken on arrival should not be too long, so that a full sleep can be taken when it is night; such a nocturnal sleep can be taken as easily as in the departure zone, since night at the destination and place of departure coincide.",

      "title": "Clinical Indices of Tobacco Use in People with Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT People with schizophrenia are more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than people in the general population. Several biological and environmental factors could interact to account for high smoking persistence in this population, including increased sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of nicotine or conditioned cues, beneficial effects of nicotine on symptoms or cognitive function, higher levels of craving or negative affect during abstinence, exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms during abstinence, and reduced motivation, self-efficacy or support for quitting. Controlled comparisons of responses to abstinence, cues and nicotine replacement in smokers with schizophrenia and equally-dependent smokers who do not have psychiatric illness may help to clarify the degree to which these biological and environmental factors may contribute to smoking persistence in people with schizophrenia. This chapter summarizes the research findings in this area and offers directions for future research.

      "title": "Sleep architecture disturbance due to the use of benzodiazepines",
      "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining a physiological sleep, is a relevant clinical issue, affecting not only the elderly population (from 20% to 40%), but also the general population since 30% of adults report problems in sleeping properly. In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Benzodiazepines and Z‐drugs",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most guidelines recommend that benzodiazepines and z‐drugs used continuously for more than 4 weeks should be withdrawn, if the patient is agreeable, because of the unfavourable balance of harms (including physical dependence, addiction, tolerance and withdrawal effects) and benefits. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of benzodiazepines and z‐drugs – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Addiction is an issue only for a small minority of benzodiazepine users whilst withdrawal effects and physical dependence affect a much larger group of patients taking medication as prescribed. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering sometimes formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one benzodiazepine to a longer‐acting drug like diazepam can sometimes be helpful.",

      "abstract": "Medical cannabis is increasingly used as a treatment or adjunct treatment with different levels of efficacy in several neurological disorders or related symptoms (such as multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson and Alzheimer disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, headache), as well as in other medical conditions (e.g. nausea and vomiting, glaucoma, appetite stimulation, cancer, inflammatory conditions, asthma). Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them. The current review presents an update of the neurological adverse effects resulting from the use of cannabis for medical purposes, highlighting the need to weigh the benefits and risks, when using cannabinoidbased treatments.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

Clinically, he reported seeing vivid, saturated colors and caricature-like objects. The patient described perceiving objects or people in motion as moving faster than normal. He reported living in a dream-like state and feeling numb and detached from other people and his surroundings. Upon pharmacotherapy initiation, facility transfer, and subsequent discharge from an acute psychiatry unit, he ultimately committed suicide. Although hallucinogen abuse is common in the United States, this case suggests that HPPD maybe significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. In some cases, this oversight may perpetuate years of unnecessary patient suffering and can ultimately lead to severe depression and suicide.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "abstract": "El trastorno por consumo de alcohol consiste en un patrón desadaptativo de consumo de la sustancia que conlleva un deterioro o malestar clínicamente significativo, un período continuado de 12 meses. Implica la presencia de una serie de síntomas y signos físicos, cognitivos, afectivos y sociales, entre estos se incluye el desarrollo de tolerancia; el síndrome de abstinencia; consumo en cantidades mayores o durante un período más largo de lo que inicialmente se pretendía; esfuerzos infructuosos de controlar o interrumpir el consumo; se emplea mucho tiempo en actividades relacionadas con la obtención de la droga; y se presenta una reducción de importantes actividades sociales, laborales o recreativas debido al consumo. Además, se continúa tomando la sustancia a pesar de tener conciencia de problemas psicológicos o físicos persistentes relacionados al consumo. Desde la perspectiva psicodinámica, los conflictos intrapsíquicos e inconscientes de personalidad son determinantes para el desarrollo del trastorno por consumo de alcohol. Estos conflictos surgen de la necesidad de reducir la tensión y la inhibición de los impulsos instintivos básicos, donde el consumo de la droga sirve como un medio para reducir la tensión, es entonces, un mecanismo de defensa regresivo y de evitación, constituye una conducta desadaptativa, autodestructiva y debilitante.",

Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams associated with the events, mental or physical distress to traumarelated cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations within the way an individual thinks and feels, and a rise within the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last for quite a month after the event. Young children are less likely to point out distress, but instead may express their memories through play. An individual with PTSD is at a better risk of suicide and intentional self-harm",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Following Intraoperative Awareness",
      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Narcotic abuse has reached alarming proportions in many areas of the United States, carrying with it a pernicious morbidity and a tragic mortality. The latter is estimated to be approximately 0.7 percent of the addict population per annum. There were over 1000 such deaths annually in 1969 and 1970 in New York City alone. Eighty percent of these fatalities in New York are attributed to “immediate acute reactions” following administration (usually intravenous) of narcotics. In Dade County (Metropolitan Miami), Florida, 86 of 87 narcotic-related fatalities, excluding 13 violent deaths in the reported series, “collapsed and died following the injection of a narcotic”. The mechanisms of sudden death in this circumstance are complex and have not been elucidated completely. Several possible explanations include narcotic overdosage with respiratory depression, narcotic induced postural hypotension, hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction, idiosyncratic reaction to unspecified material(s), adverse response to intravenous injection of colloid or particulate material (“colloidoclastic crisis”), or adverse reactions to adulterants in narcotic packets which are purchased “on the street”.",

The most common cause of NAS are opioids such as heroin, codeine and morphine and is commonly termed as opioid withdrawal syndrome but also other legally or illegally sold substances over the counter can contribute to this syndrome. Infants also develop some kind of addition in the womb when exposed to some antidepressants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine. There are two kinds of NAS that exist, prenatal NAS which is as a result of the termination of medication being used with a pregnant mother and postnatal NAS which occurs as a result of the termination of drugs directly to the infant. The most frequently occurring syndrome consists of tremor, insomnia, perspiration, Common syndrome according to the frequency includes tremor, high-pitched sneezing sound, increased muscle tone, regurgitation and emesis, loose stools, s, excoriation, mottling, nasal congestion low-grade fever, and tachypnea. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can be a reflection of other symptoms of other conditions in a new-born, such as infections, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, and brain complications (eg., cerebral palsy). The need and time frame of treatment is reduced by breastfeeding. All NAS babies need to be followed up regularly. Not all infants will require treatment with pharmacotherapy, but all should receive non-pharmacologic interventions.

      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

There are two primary features of addiction to all forms of natural and pharmacological stimuli. First, the rewarding stimulus associated with the addiction is a compelling motivator of behavior at the expense of behaviors leading to the acquisition of other rewarding stimuli. Thus, individuals come to orient increasing amounts of their daily activity around acquisition of the rewarding stimulus to which they are addicted. Second, there is a persistence of craving for the addictive stimulus, combined with an inability to regulate the behaviors associated with obtaining that stimulus. Thus, years after the last exposure to an addictive stimulus, reexposure to that stimulus or environmental cues associated with that stimulus will elicit behavior seeking to obtain the reward.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "New Clinical Implications of Opiate Maintenance Treatments",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor\r\n\r\nOpiate addiction is a chronic mental illness with severe repercussion in personal and public health. Various medicaments have been subjected to research in order to find a proper treatment, methadone is the most and wide used drug, buprenorphine/naloxone is the most recent ones, but other choices have been proposed such as prescribing heroin (1). The mentioned treatments, are considered as maintenance ones, because, the chronic illnesses need a longtime approach. Other possibilities have been studied, for example the detoxification (conventional or ultra-rapid) as well as the use of opiate antagonist as naltrexone. On the other hand, a long period of dis habituation or relapse prevention is required after detoxification of all sorts of addictions, including opiate dependency.\r\n\r\nOn this second phase, psychological therapies are very important, as well as social and family support. Most patients need during dis habituation (of heroin addiction) a preliminary period of opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone (2).\r\n\r\nSide effects, as well as notwell-known effects, of drug and treatments are a very interesting goal of research. The hypogonadotrophic effect of opioids can be observed even after the administration of a single opioid dose, both in laboratory animals and in humans (3). Other studies have reported that methadone and buprenorphine are opioids with effects on spermatogenesis (4) and secondary sex organs. It seems probable that these drugs could affect testes volume.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, those effects have quantitative differences depending on the opiate as showed in the paper titled “A quantitative and qualitative study of rat testis following administration of methadone and buprenorphine” (5).\r\n\r\nHeidari et al. observed Buprenorphine treatment is more appropriate for treating opiate addiction in male rats since it does not affect normal testicular structure and function (5). Those results should be considered by all the professionals involved in addictions and their co-morbidities (dual pathology) research projects and treatment, not only because of the consequences of this side effect on sexuality or reproduction, but also how the testosterone deficiency is related to the not well-known effects of opioid maintenance treatments, as its antipsychotic properties or its influence on personality dimensions as reward dependence on opiate dependents type II or antisocial (6).",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies.",

      "title": "Considerations on third generation antihistamines",
      "abstract": "For several months now, the term ‘third generation of antihistamines’ has emerged spontaneously from the medical literature. These attempts at definition, which vary greatly, create confusion both for the health professionals and the lay public. This is of considerable concern for the scientific community involved in allergy, mainly due to the lack of consensus. One definition refers to the active metabolites of new second generation drugs as the basis for a third one [1,2]. Others are focused on certain specific properties: no electrocardiogram (ECG) effects [3], rapid onset of action [4] or no drug interactions [3]. First generation antihistamines were defined by their H1 receptor blocking power and despite pronounced unwanted side-effects are still often used mainly in over-the-counter (OTC) products, alone or in combination with other drugs. The second generation antihistamines are said to be ‘non-sedating H1 blockers’ due to the lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Compared to the first generation, they are known for their high potency and minimal central nervous system (CNS) effects. Numerous compounds have been created responding to their own pharmacokinetics. Some of them undergo extensive metabolism, others do not. Cardiotoxic effects emerged with some second generation antihistamines and most of the new compounds exhibit properties on systems other than H1 receptors, i.e. anti-inflammatory properties. Certainly, the second generation manifests a great diversity. Which criteria should drugs have to fulfil to be labelled as third generation antihistamine? This is obviously for the scientific community to answer. To pave the way for the elaboration of a consensual definition and with the support of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, a Consensus Group on New Generation Antihistamines (CONGA) has been set up. This Group is led by Professor S. T. Holgate (UK) and includes Professor G. W. Canonica (Italy), Dr G. Scadding (UK), Professor F. Estelle R. Simons (Canada), Professor M. Tharp (USA), Professor H. Timmerman (the Netherlands) and Professor K. Yanai (Japan), so that there will be a multidisciplinary input. This exercise is closely linked to the Southampton Workshop ‘Antihistamines: Back to the Future’[5] and should appear as a necessary sequel after a 4-year evolution of the antihistamine class. The Consensus Group met for the first time at the University of Leuven (Belgium), June 11–12, 2001, and made clear the necessity to clarify the theme with the help of international experts representing the different fields involved in allergy. Respecting a strictly academic approach, the Consensus Group agreed on the following aims: (a) to review in depth the present status of the term ‘third generation antihistamines’, (b) to analyse the potential criteria that drugs should fulfil to be labelled as third generation, (c) to find gaps and to bridge them with the back-up of expert networking, and (d) to issue a consensual statement endorsed by the scientific community.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

The most commonly used drugs are benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. The use of benzodiazepines, either alone or in combination with high potency neuroleptics, has increased in recent years. Benzodiazepines are extremely safe but may cause respiratory depression and hypotension. Respiratory depression is more likely with intravenous administration, therefore these medications should be given slowly and titrated to the desired effect. Special care should be taken when sedating patients who are under the influence of alcohol or narcotics and are sleep apneic patients. This report deals with a case of respiratory distress in a patient with sleep apnea syndrome after the rapid tranqulization. All patients receiving chemical restraint must be carefully monitored. For critically ill patients who require sedation or chemical restraint, the constant attendance of a physician may be warranted.",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

Similarly confusing may be the temporary cessation of menstruation, consequent on lingering suppression of pituitaryovarian function after discontinuance of estrogen intake. The uncertainty about pregnancy may be worrisome. Much more serious is the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function that lingers after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. Without the support of exogenous corticosteroids, the patient is unable to cope with stress, eg, trauma or infection.

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Internalizing disorders represent mental or behavioral conditions that are dominated by emotionality. Emotions are an adaptive tool to deal with life’s challenges. Adolescence is a developmental period when emotions can be extreme when elicited by both positive and negative experiences. The major internalizing disorders are depressive disorders and anxiety disorders; related ones in this domain include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, and autism. Treatment effectiveness for teenagers with substance use disorder and a coexisting internalizing disorder is optimized when both domains are addressed. Behavioral-based treatment approaches with concurrent psychotropic medication are part of the treatment plan. One of the most common mental and behavioral disorders among adolescents in the United States is depression. For those suffering from a major depressive disorder, symptoms include a period of at least 2 weeks of a very persistent low mood accompanied with low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, and problems with sleep, energy, and concentration.",

After an athlete experiences a traumatic event, sequelae may include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also other reactions, especially culture-specific patterns of symptoms and comorbidities such as depression. Comorbid substance abuse can hide unrecognized PTSD. Posttraumatic symptoms in athletes interfere with rehabilitation and performance. Support and treatment of posttraumatic symptoms in athletes require specialized care. Ethical dilemmas can develop, especially when traumatic stress is resulting from abuse, from events related to overtraining, or from inadequate care or violence within teams.",

Many types of medicaments can cause akathisia as an adverse event of their use and they include: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, antihistamines, and psychoactive substances. We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify. Therefore, it is necessary to have akathisia in mind when using certain medicaments, especially when combining several that use the same enzymatic system and consequently raise levels of at least one of them.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Acute Respiratory Failure from Abused Substances",
      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

While accepting her into the Intensive Care Unit, she was awake, alert, disoriented and agitated. After 2h, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The necessary treatment was given and 9h later with hemodynamic improvement, the patients' mental status improved.

In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4.

      "abstract": "The first case of insomnia with which I had to deal, my own case, taught me the utter uselessness of depending solely upon hypnotics for the relief of this condition; and subsequent cases treated successfully by food, baths and exercise have shown that hypnotics are not only not to be depended upon, but that in many cases they are not required at all, and do more harm than good. I do not wish, however, to be understood as advocating the disuse of hypnotics in all cases of insomnia; my remarks must be taken to apply only, so far as my experience goes, to febrile insomnia, or the insomnia of convalescence from acute diseases, to the condition of sleeplessness arising from long hours of mental activity or excitement, and to insomnia from exhaustion. The two last may often be classed together. In febrile insomnia there is a greater or less degree",

      "title": "Some aspects of tobacco smoking in the context of alcohol drinking, hangover and mental health problems",
      "abstract": "The public health relevance of hangover is in its potential effects on occupational safety and performance. Apart from pharmacological effects of ethanol and congeners, psychosocial factors also contribute to morning-after feelings, particularly the emotions of shame and guilt. Tobacco smoking increases the hangover's incidence and severity, explained by pharmacological effects of nicotine and other smoke constituents. During a drinking binge, many people would smoke more than usual; some intermittent smokers or those who gave up would restart. The hangover \"curing\" with beer or vodka the next morning (hair of the dog) may contribute to negative affectivity in the long run, as it implies a cycle of alcohol consumption and shame. Some individuals experience a temporary symptomatic relief after a hair of the dog drink. According to our observations, if the \"curing\" is accompanied by smoking, the elevated mood in some people would more easily shift to dysphoria, irritation or depression. Psychological mechanisms thereof are discussed here. Besides, the problem of smoking in psychiatric hospitals is briefly discussed. In conclusion, smoking can exacerbate hangover symptoms through both toxicological and psychosocial mechanisms. The problem of smoking in the settings of alcoholism and mental health problems should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

Second, they consistently demonstrate relapse to the agent of abuse; that is, they attempt to stop using the drug for varying periods of time but return to it despite a specific intent to avoid it. This treatment approach is not necessary for those abusers who can, in fact, learn to set limits on their use of alcohol or drugs; their use may be treated as a behavioral symptom in a more traditional psychotherapeutic fashion. Nor is it directed at those patients for whom the addictive pattern is most unmanageable (e.g., addicted people with unusual destabilizing circumstances such as homelessness, severe character pathology, or psychosis). These patients may need special supportive care (e.g., inpatient detoxification or long-term residential treatment).",

Meanwhile, constipation, including symptoms of evacuation difficulty and/or fewer bowel movements, is a common problem as people age. Risk factors include problems in cognition, mobility, gastrointestinal motility, dysautonomia, anorectal dysfunction, and disabling neurologic disorders. Faecal incontinence is more common in frail individuals but is often assessed inadequately. The cause is often multifactorial. Treatment depends on the cause: a combination of approaches may be necessary, including avoidance of faecal impaction, instigation of a structured bowel care plan including regular prompted toileting, dietary modification, and (in some cases) use of loperamide or similar medications.",

Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such.

The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

Over the last two centuries, there have been instances where physicians have committed deliberate acts of murder on wives, relatives, patients, and others. Their motivation has ranged from ridding themselves of a nagging wife or for insurance and inheritance gains to insane acts. The methods used have usually been associated with poisons and drugs, of which the physician may have great familiarity. The frequency of physician-involved murders seems to have increased in the past two decades with several sensational cases being the topics of media coverage and further review in books and visual media, including television and the movies. The investigation of these cases may be very difficult, especially when a drug may be given to a victim which could cause severe problems after small amounts are given. The detection of death as being a murder may be the first problem faced, the demonstration of the fatal agent in the body in the next problem, and probably the most difficult is finding a suspect with the medication in his or her possession or paraphenalia for injecting such as a syringe and needle. The stealth and cunning of the murderer may further complicate the picture for the investigator as well as the reputation of the physician in the community, which is often above reproach so that the public has to be convinced of the actual involvement of the suspect.",

Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

      "title": "Food Addiction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "title": "A complex polymorphous psychosis or a cycloid psychosis with a different onset?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute and transitory psychotic disorders comprise a polymorphous picture such as Leonhard’s cycloid psychoses, which alternate episodes of affective symptoms such as psychosis between two poles (anguish/happiness, incoherence/stupor, or akinesia/hyperkinesia). Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

A 19‐year‐old male is reported who was assaulted and placed in a head‐down position in the back of a car were he was later found dead. Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body. Cases of positional asphyxia involving others may not always include restraint, and when encountered should initiate a careful evaluation of the possible events and lethal pathophysiological processes.",

Terjadi peningkatan penyalahgunaan Narkotika, Psikotropika dan Zat Adiktif lainnya (NAPZA) di Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun, terutama penggunaan ganja karena mudah didapat. Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia. There is an increase in the abuse of Narcotics, Psychotropic and other Addictive Substances (NAPZA) in Indonesia over the years, especially the use of cannabis because it is easy to obtain. Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11).

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly. Furthermore, prevalence and incidence, definition and causes of voice disorders in elderly are shown by presenting results of the recent researches. This paper also describes diagnostic procedures and current treatments for voice disorders in elderly and addresses its efficiency.",

Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

      "abstract": "Manganese toxicity may present with the insidious onset of neuropsychological symptoms or as an acute agitated psychosis that may resembleschizophrenia. This is a rare disorder, but early diagnosis and treatment are is important if long-term disabling consequences are to be avoided. Exposure to manganese is usually in the form of inhalation of fumes or dust from occupational exposure, mainly in welders or individuals who work with metal ores or in battery or chemical factories. Accidental ingestion is possible from contaminated well water or herbal remedies. Initial neuropsychological symptoms are usually nonspecific, with prominent sleep disturbances, weakness, fatigue, irritability, emotional lability and mental slowing. Manganese is an essential element, necessary for variety of biological processes including carbohydrate and fat metabolism and bone growth and development. Excessive intake leads to toxicity.",

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

      "title": "Sonographic Changes in Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in a full-term infant is a clinically defined syndrome of the disturbed neurologic function in the earliest days after birth in infancy, manifested by difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration, the depression of the muscle tone and reflexes, the subnormal level of consciousness and often seizures (Nelson & Leviton, 1991). HIE is the term used to describe the resultant condition due to a deficit in the oxygen supply to the brain. The neonatal brain can have a lack of oxygen through two major pathogenetic mechanisms, hypoxemia, which is a diminished amount of oxygen in the blood supply, and ischemia, which is a diminished amount of blood perfusing the brain. During the perinatal period hypoxemia or ischemia or both occur as a result of asphyxia, an impairement in the exchange of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The duration and severity of HIE depend of the severity of asphyxia. Neonatal asphyxial encephalopathy occurs in 1–2 per 1000 births in the high income countries (Marlow & Budge, 2005; Pierrat et al., 2005; Barkovich, 2005), in low-income countries, the incidence is much higher (Ellis et al., 2000; Black et al., 2010).",

Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw.

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

Confusion may be worsened in already delirious patients. Anxiety, psychosis, cardiovascular effects, insomnia, and tremor may occur but infrequently require discontinuation. Appetite is normally stimulated in the medically ill. In fact, stimulants are frequently utilized in the medically ill largely because of their minimal toxicity. The history of U.S. stimulant abuse in the twentieth century is briefly discussed. Abuse of prescribed stimulants appears to be infrequent. Over-zealous concern regarding abuse has previously led to unfortunate declines in appropriate utilization of stimulants, e.g., for attention deficit disorder. Guidelines for prescribing stimulants in light of abuse potential are included.",

Antidepressants and mood stabilizers, the medications commonly used to treat depression or bipolar illness, do not produce dependence and have no potential for abuse. They are safe for individuals in recovery from alcoholism or drug dependence. Depression is no longer attributed simply to too little neurochemicals such as serotonin or norepinephrine. Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns. Antidepressants treat specific symptoms of depression such as depressed mood, sadness, fatigue and suicidality, and they also regulate the altered brain chemistry that may contribute to these symptoms.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

      "title": "[Heroin addiction].",
      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

They may be the cause of various mental and physical symptoms. Taking psychoactive substances carries the risk of negative effects on the entire body, including the risk of disorders in physical and emotional development. Psychoactive substances, such as alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs, disturb the functioning of the senses, memory, thinking, motor coordination, and disrupt the development of the entire body. Taking psychoactive substances may result in physical and/or psychological addiction.",

      "title": "RELAPSE: Answers to Why a Patient Is Having a New Mood Episode",
      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "Prodromal stage of disease (dementia) with Lewy bodies, how to diagnose in practice?",
      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Idiopathic Environmental Intolerances",
      "abstract": "Health concerns related to the quality of the environment in offices, schools, homes, and residences have increased dramatically over the past 2 decades. One health problem frequently confronting medical practitioners and often attributed to environmental quality problems is idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEI). Formerly known as multiple chemical sensitivities, IEI is an acquired disorder characterized by adverse reactions attributed to exposure to a variety of substances under ordinary conditions. Alleged precipitants include solvents, pesticides, detergents, dusts, and fragrances. Symptoms include fatigue, malaise, headache, concentration and memory difficulties, lightheadedness, cough, hoarseness, and rhinitis without objective physical signs or consistent laboratory abnormalities. The role of the environment in precipitating these complaints continues to be controversial, and no intervention or treatment has thus far been proven to be effective. While not progressive or life threatening, IEI is often functionally disabling and very distressing to affected individuals. The investigation of IEI should involve, at a minimum, a clinical evaluation of the affected person and in most cases an environmental evaluation as well. IEI should be managed without overutilization of diagnostic tests or prescription of unnecessary environmental, occupational, or dietary restrictions.",

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "title": "Suicidality and substance abuse in affective disorders.",
      "abstract": "The relationship between suicidality and substance abuse has long been recognized, although studies have only fairly recently begun to identify factors that may help clarify how alcohol or other drug abuse increases the susceptibility to suicidal behavior in vulnerable populations. In particular, alcohol and other psychoactive substance misuse has been linked with mood destabilization and the induction of manic or depressive episodes in affectively ill individuals, while also demarcating groups with heightened tendencies toward impulsivity, aggression, and sensitivity to interpersonal loss. Serotonergic mechanisms have been implicated in each of these clinical settings, along with possible dysregulation of other neurotransmitter systems. Psychosocial aspects of alcohol or drug abuse relevant to suicide may involve a heightened sensitivity to interpersonal loss, poor coping skills in response to adverse life events, and affective dysregulation induced by circadian and psychosocial stresses. Consequently, self-destructive behaviors with relatively little premeditation may arise during periods of increased stress, intoxication, depression, or other psychopathology. Early detection of substance abuse followed by appropriate pharmacologic and/or psychotherapeutic interventions may greatly help to minimize the formation of complex comorbid psychiatric conditions and reduce the potential for suicidal acts among high-risk populations.",

      "title": "Safe Deprescribing of Antidepressants",
      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "title": "The unmasking of hidden severe hyponatremia after long-term combination therapy in exacerbated bipolar patients",
      "abstract": "Hyponatremia is occasionally unmasked in psychiatric patients during hospitalization after routine blood and urinary tests, and correlates in most cases with an inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, mainly due to iatrogenic factors. Only a few studies have regarded the combination of psychotropic drugs as triggers of chronic, asymptomatic hyponatremia in bipolar patients, who require to be hospitalized because of the exacerbation of their mental illness. We presented three clinical cases of patients affected by a long-term psychiatric disorder and under polypharmacotherapy for several months. After excluding other potential factors, we hypothesized that pharmacological treatment with a mood stabilizer (oxcarbazepine) associated with a benzodiazepine (delorazepam), a second-generation antipsychotic (olanzapine) or an antidepressant (fluvoxamine), triggered severe hyponatremia ([Na+] ≤125 mEq/L), serum hypo-osmolarity, and elevated inappropriate urine osmolarity added to more diluted sodium concentration. When we discontinued the treatment, clinical conditions of our patients improved, despite the previous administration of hypertonic saline jointly with water restriction. Psychiatrists should consider that bipolar patients on long-term polypharmacotherapy may present a higher risk of severe hyponatremia not clinically detectable. Consequently, routine laboratory tests should be periodically repeated as they represent the only available tool to unmask such electrolyte imbalances.",

      "title": "SUPPRESSION OF TENEURIN-4 IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS ALLEVIATES METHAMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE AND BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the World Drug Report 2022 from United Nations, amphetamine-type stimulants take third place in worldwide drug addiction, primary methamphetamine (METH) [1]. And over 30,0000 people died from drug overdoses induced by stimulants combined with other drugs [2]. METH is recognized as a widely distributed psychostimulant with a strong addictive potential that impacts the central nervous system and body health [3]. METH predominantly exerts its influence on the limbic system through the stimulation of the release of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical element of the brain's reward circuitry. Both short-term and prolonged METH use can result in lasting physical and mental health complications, some of which may endure indefinitely. Over the last decades, significant social problems associated with METH have gotten worse over the past few decades, especially after COVID-19 [1, 2]. Aim &amp; Objectives Our previous data revealed several genes associated with METH, including Odz4 gene. The Odz4 gene encodes teneurin-4 (TENM4) protein which belongs to one subtype of type II transmembrane teneurin proteins (TENM1-4) [4]. Genetic studies have indicated a correlation between teneurin proteins and developmental issues, neurological disorders, and drug residence [5]. Recently, some clinical research found that the Odz4 gene has an abnormal mutant in the brain of patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [6, 7]. Based on the aforementioned research, it is suggested that TENM4 might play a role in the progress of drug addiction. Here we investigated the performance of TENM4 knockdown in METH-induced dopamine release of NAc shell and behavior alterations in mice. Method We administered METH or saline subcutaneously to mice for six consecutive days. Two hours after the final injection of METH, we sacrificed all mice and preserved them under 80°. Then we investigated the changes in Odz4 mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and WB, respectively. Subsequently, we injected AAV-carrying Odz4-targeting gRNA involved CRISPR-Cas system into the NAc After four weeks of the injection, we assessed the time response of dopamine in NAc by in vivo microdialysis and alteration of conditioned place preference induced by METH. Results We found a significant increase in Odz4 mRNA and TENM4 protein levels in the NAc region after continued METH administration. We confirmed the knockdown effect by AAV injection of the NAc of mice. The TENM4 knockdown exhibited an attenuated response of dopamine and place preference induced by METH. Discussion and Conclusion These results indicate the association between TENM4 and the pharmacological effects of METH in NAc region of mice. However, addiction behaviors affected by the knockdown of TENM4 and its specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear and require further investigation.

At doses of 1.5–7.5 mg/kg body mass it induces stimulation, mood improvement, motor impairment, and used at doses higher than 7.5 mg/kg b.m., it exerts dissociative effects. Adverse reactions are especially clear when DXM was taken with alcohol or substances affecting metabolic activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6. Among DXM users, some cases of psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms were observed. Long-term use of DXM may be associated with cognitive function deterioration. The abuse of Tantum Rosa (a popular gynecological anti-inflammatory drug containing benzydamine) was described mainly in Brazil, Poland and Romania. It causes hallucinations (mainly visual) and \"flashbacks\" (short-term hallucinations despite not being under the influence of the psychedelic compound). Pseudoephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant, produces mood improvement or even euphoria, hallucinations and psychosis. However, the real health threat is associated with the use of substances produced from pseudoephedrine: ephedrone and methamphetamine. Coraz częstszym zjawiskiem, szczególnie wśród młodzieży, jest \"rekreacyjne\" zażywanie leków. Dotyczy to m.in. przyjmowania substancji działających przeciwzapalnie lub przeciwkaszlowo, które w dużych dawkach wykazują działanie psychoaktywne. Łatwo dostępne leki w odręcznej sprzedaży mogą skutkować występowaniem całej gamy objawów, w tym omamów lub euforii. Szczególnie często zażywanym lekiem jest dekstrometorfan (DXM). W dawkach 1,5–7,5 mg/kg m.c. powoduje pobudzenie, poprawę nastroju, zaburzenia motoryczne, a w dawkach >7,5 mg/kg m.c. wykazuje działanie dysocjacyjne. Działania niepożądane są szczególnie wyraźne, gdy przyjmowany jest z alkoholem lub substancjami wpływającymi na aktywność metaboliczną izoenzymu CYP2D6 cytochromu P450. U osób stosujących DXM obserwowano przypadki uzależnienia psychicznego i występowania objawów abstynencyjnych. Długotrwałe zażywanie DXM może pogarszać funkcje kognitywne. Z kolei nadużywanie Tantum Rosa – popularnego w ginekologii preparatu benzydaminy o działaniu przeciwzapalnym, przeciwbólowym i miejscowo znieczulającym – jest opisywane głównie w Brazylii, Polsce i Rumunii. Lek ten wywołuje omamy, najczęściej wzrokowe oraz występowanie tzw. flashbacks (krótkotrwałych halucynacji pojawiających się mimo niepozostawania pod wpływem substancji psychoaktywnych). Pseudoefedryna, należąca do grupy amfetaminopodobnych stymulantów, powoduje poprawę nastroju, a nawet euforię, omamy i psychozy. Zagrożenie stanowią pozyskiwane z niej substancje o silniejszym działaniu psychoaktywnym: efedron i metamfetamina.",

Mushrooms were usually eaten fresh, cooked, or mixed with tea. Occasionally, people of the ancient period used to take it with tobacco or cannabis. The common forms of NBOMe are inactive when swallowed; the most common methods of taking them are under the tongue, held on the cheek, or snorted.

      "abstract": "Abstract The core problem of addicts is addiction and not the other mental disorders that may be present. This is because the addictive thinking, feeling and acting is the dominant defense that blocks success in therapy. The therapist and the patient therefore externally symbolize with chairs 1. The patient’s healthy adult thinking, 2. His self-protection through his addictive thinking and feeling, and 3. His symptoms in everyday life. They develop further his addictive thinking and feeling in the as-if mode of play and paradoxically work out the positive meaning of this defense within the framework of his self-regulation. The patient’s self-development initially should take place in the symptom production. This is because metacognitive confusion prevents patients with addiction from adequately processing deeper conflicts. The patient should first gain ego control over his addictive self-regulation. This disorder-specific approach is indicated for harmful use or dependence on alcohol or drugs, and also for non-substance-related addictions such as eating disorders, internet addiction, sex addiction, and other addictions. It makes the experiences of Alcoholics Anonymous fruitful in digested form for depth psychological, behavioral, and systemic therapy.",

One study of institutionalized abusers describes persistent hallucinations despite abstinence, with evolution into a “schizophreniform” psychosis. It is suggested that occupational exposure to toluene can have a similar outcome. Taken in concert with the credible neurological literature, our considerable experience with more than 30 cases of toluene abuse, 15 of toluene solvent mixture neurotoxicity, and of many with considerable workplace exposure indicates the combination of persistent psychosis and toluene inhalation does rarely occur. However, it is the chance coincidence of two relatively common conditions, toluene encephalopathy and underlying schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "Abstract Elderly individuals, particularly those with cognitive impairment, are oftentimes restless during the night, and this increases the distress of relatives, professional carers and themselves. A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

However, perhaps the most important symptom in this context is the failure of attempts to stop smoking when a person tries to accomplish this. Frequent smoking is thought to set up a subconscious learning process linked to the release of nicotine from cigarettes.2 When a person decides to stop smoking, s/he is afflicted by urges to smoke, often in places where smoking has previously taken place.3 Furthermore, such a person usually experiences withdrawal symptoms.4 These are mostly adverse moods, but with some physical symptoms as well. It is thought that these urges to smoke are primarily responsible for the failure of most attempts to stop smoking. Without support around half of all attempts to stop fail within the first week of attempted abstinence.5 The typical smoker who seeks treatment for cessation has never managed more than a few weeks without smoking.6 The period of withdrawal varies by symptom, but typically lasts a few weeks.4 Therefore most smokers' experience of not smoking is state of withdrawal and perhaps beliefs that smoking is a stress reliever, for example, stem from experiencing withdrawal during abstinence.\n\nThe two main approaches to assist cessation are pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation aims primarily to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or ameliorate the aversive symptoms. Behavioural support aims to boost or support motivation to resist the urge to smoke and develop people's capacity to implement their plans to avoid smoking. These interventions last typically only a few months. It is thought that during these months, the strength of the associative learning between smoking and …",

The intention of this review is to discuss the most common ocular effects, the medications that cause them, and the mechanisms by which they occur.According to National Poison Data System, the most common reported ocular effects following a drug ingestion/injection/inhalation are mydriasis, miosis, and nystagmus. The most common drug/drug classes reported to a regional poison control center causing these ocular effects include the following: first, mydriasis - amphetamines and diphenhydramine; second, miosis - clonidine and opioids; third, nystagmus - dextromethorphan. However, many other drugs/substances can cause these effects along with other systemic effects.Ocular findings are a pertinent component of any patient assessment involving therapeutic and/or toxic exposure to medications and other substances.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "The term Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) was initially used in the 1950s [1]. ME describes a syndrome where there is general muscle pain associated with evidence of a disturbed nervous system [2]. ME, commonly referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), or post-viral fatigue syndrome is a condition in which mental and physical fatigue predominate. It is characterized by gross abnormal muscle fatigue which occurs after relatively mild activity. Other symptoms regularly complained of include sleep disturbance, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, feeling depressed, bouts of low grade fever (not exceeding 38-6°C), increased sensitivity to light, back and neck pain, sore throat, irritable bowel and bladder [3]. The symptoms of ME typically become apparent following a viral infection [4], although other trigger factors have been noted. Vaccinations against cholera, tetanus, typhoid and influenza have been associated with the onset of ME [5]. It has also been observed that any psychological disturbances in ME occur secondary to, or share a common pathophysiology with an immunological dysfunction [6]. In many cases there appears to be no apparent triggering factor [7].",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

The clinical feature of this type of poisoning varies from headache and nausea to more severe conditions. After recovery from the acute intoxication, neurological or behavioral problems may emerge. In 3%-40% of cases, delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome (DNS) in post CO poisoning, generally develops within few weeks after a preliminary remission from acute poisoning. Case Presentation: We report a patient with relatively suitable premorbid. He was admitted to the hospital with fire burning, co poisoning and discharged home with good general conditions and mental status by receiving normal baric oxygen 100%. later in post-operative management of skin graft he developed a fulminant neurological deficit by impaired memory and concentration, loosening of association, disorientation to place, time and person, agitation, aggression, mood labiality, urinary incontinency and encopresis, slow psychomotor retardation, false and approximate answers to questions, auditory and visual hallucination, staring and inappropriate laughing. As the patient was not responsive to neurological treatment, he was referred to psychiatric service.

Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and a higher risk of incarceration. Appropriate screening, assessment, and integrated (mental health and addiction) services for dual diagnosis are key components of care for this complex patient group.",

      "abstract": "Ottosson J-O. The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that continued excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of physiological dependence. When drinking is abruptly terminated or substantially reduced in the dependent individual, a characteristic withdrawal syndrome ensues. As with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of chronic alcohol use are opposite in nature to the effects of intoxication. Thus, clinical features of alcohol withdrawal include signs of heightened autonomic nervous system activation (e.g., tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, diaphoresis, tremor), CNS hyperexcitability that may culminate in motor seizures, and, in its most severe form, hallucinosis and delerium tremens (1–3). In addition to physical signs of withdrawal, a constellation of symptoms contributing to psychological discomfort (e.g., irritability, agitation, anxiety, dysphoria) constitute a significant component of the withdrawal syndrome (4–7). The overall intensity of the withdrawal syndrome is presumed to reflect the degree of physiological dependence developed during the course of chronic alcohol use/abuse.",

Alcoholism produces pathophysiological effects where alcohol is concentrated in the blood which is related to the central nervous system causing depressive disorders where the human can lead to a coma. One of the main consequences is the excessive use of alcohol that causes physical, mental and social damages as it affects the brain centers responsible for self-control, which means that we do not stop taking the effects of substance use. Symptoms of withdrawal include autonomic hyperactivity such as tremor in the hands, insomnia, visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations. One of the factors that increase the level of alcohol consumption is sex, young age, aggression, anxiety, sweating, and depression. Through nursing interventions in a patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, it will be possible to identify, plan, organize and execute the actions that will be performed both for the patient and the family and to determine the most damaging effects and consequences in this type of pathology.",

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

      "title": "Finding Genes for Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

Such observations support the view that stopping treatment is not equivalent to being untreated. With lithium, antipsychotics and antidepressants, there is consistent evidence that abrupt or rapid discontinuation is followed by earlier clinical worsening than with more gradual removal of treatment. Moreover, treatment discontinuation can complicate interpretation of responses to changes in treatment, including in clinical practice and in experimental treatment trials. Notably, terminating preceding treatments can lead to both discontinuation and carry-over effects that can have an impact on the interpretation of observed outcomes.",

The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts.

It adversely effect a wide range of health condition and yoga is the most comprehensive approach to fighting stress. When we are in stress our nervous system respond by releasing a flood of stress hormone. This hormone stimulates the body for emergency action by “fight-flight or freeze” reaction also known as stress response. The agent which causes stress is known as ‘stressors’. Stress causes many harmful effect on the body such as , Physical impact - Weight gain/loss, Unexpected hair loss, Heart palpitations, High blood pressure, Digestive symptoms (such as dryness of mouth, flatulence, nausea, butterfly stomach)etc. Emotional negative effect includes Mood swing, Anxiety, Can lead to depression & unhealthy coping strategies (i.e. alcohol, drugs).",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "abstract": "Acoustic shock is a recently recognised clinical entity: following an abrupt, intense and unanticipated acoustic stimulus, usually delivered by a telephone handset or headset, some individuals report a symptom cluster that includes otalgia, altered hearing, aural fullness, imbalance, tinnitus, dislike or even fear of loud noises, and anxiety and/or depression. Symptoms start shortly after the triggering acoustic incident and can be short-lived or can last for a considerable time. If persistent, the condition can lead to significant disability. Proposed mechanisms include involvement of the tensor tympani muscle, hyperexcitability of central auditory pathways, and a precursive state of raised anxiety or arousal. A formal treatment programme has not yet been proposed, but the potential utility of modern therapeutic techniques for tinnitus and hyperacusis are considered. Given the large number of UK residents working in telephone call centres, this condition is of considerable clinical importance.",

      "title": "Clinical Pharmacological Issues in Treating Psychiatric Disorders of Patients with Mental Retardation",
      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of corresponding external sound(s). Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

In present postmortem cases methamphetamine and other combined drugs have issue in cardiac major health problems and poisoning-related deaths. Many postmortem cases found positive to methamphetamine and amphetamine or combined with other drugs include different narcotics/ stimulants drugs such as : benzodiazepines, THC, opium, and lyrica.

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

Such difficulties can include problems with the placement and manipulation of food in the oral cavity or the physiology of swallowing, or both, and are referred to as dysphagia. Swallowing is a highly complex motor process, requiring neurological control and coordination of breathing and swallowing. Cerebral damage may affect the neurological control of swallowing (Murdoch and Theodoros 2001) and consequently, the child is at increased risk of fluids and food material entering the airway, termed aspiration. According to Reilly et al. (2000) the signs suggestive of aspiration include coughing, choking or deterioration in respiratory status during a feed, noisy or wet breathing, or excessive pharyngeal secretions; sneezing during drinking may also indicate nasopharyngeal incoordination and reflux.",

Review of the literature disclosed a paucity of previous reports of hiccup, but many reports of myoclonus after opiate administration. A wide variety of opiates and routes of administration have been implicated, but high doses and the presence of other agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antidepressants) may pose special risks. Review of the literature suggests three types of opiate- related myoclonus. Opiate-induced myoclonus (OIM) is often generalized and is either periodic or associated with rigidity. Opiate-induced myoclonus frequently occurs in the context of underlying medical conditions, D2 antagonist coadministration, or other drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants), and usually responds to either naloxone or benzodiazepines. Intrathecal OIM has not been linked to D2 antagonist coadministration or benzodiazepine responsiveness but may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Opiate withdrawal myoclonus may be stimulus- sensitive, associated with D2 antagonist coadministration, and responsive to benzodiazepines and unresponsive to naloxone. There are several problems in interpreting the literature, and more study is needed. Opiatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and other mechanisms are considered.",

      "abstract": "Side effects play a significant role in the selection of drugs to be used in panic disorder/agoraphobia whose polyphobic symptomatology often includes a suspiciousness about taking drugs and a fear of undesired side effects which may lead to the refusal of treatment. The safety, side effects and patients' acceptance of alprazolam and imipramine versus placebo were evaluated in 1168 subjects with panic disorder/agoraphobia who had been enrolled in the second phase of the Upjohn World Wide Panic Study. Side effects that worsened over baseline to a greater extent with alprazolam than with imipramine and placebo were sedation, fatigue/weakness, memory problems, ataxia and slurred speech. In the imipramine group blurred vision, tachycardia/palpitations, insomnia, sleep disturbance, excitement/nervousness, malaise, dizziness/faintness, headache, nausea/vomiting and decrease in appetite were worse than in the other groups. In the placebo group the anxious symptoms were most prominent. The highest level of compliance was shown in the alprazolam-treated group and the lowest in the placebo-treated group. Strong predictors of side effects were not observed. If a side effect profile is known, it will be easier for a clinician to choose the right drug and the appropriate management by taking into account compliance, safety and efficacy in each patient under treatment. Further information about side effects in long-term maintenance treatment would be of great clinical pertinence in ensuring safety and enhancing patients' quality of life.",

Up to half of all cigarettes are consumed by a minority of the population: persons with schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness. Ironically, despite nicotine dependence being considered a serious and deadly form of addiction in the general population, research on smoking in mental illness is predominantly guided by the idea that smoking has beneficial medication-like treatment effects. This article considers pitfalls of adherence to the self-medication hypothesis as an exclusively held dogma. New evidence from animal modeling work suggests the need to broaden hypothesis-driven research on smoking in mental illness. Adolescent smoking could predispose to mental illness and/or increased nicotine dependence in schizophrenia may represent an involuntary, general addiction vulnerability that has little to do with the 'helpful' psychoactive effects of nicotine or other drugs.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms: are we making progress?",
      "abstract": "A substantial proportion of patients in general practice consult for subjective symptoms, such as pain or fatigue, without corresponding objective findings.1–4 Some of these patients present trivial symptoms that do not indicate disease; others recover after long-lasting symptoms and disability. Here, we shall refer to conditions with long-lasting and disabling symptoms, not trivial or passing symptoms. Such conditions are called medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Syndromes with specific diagnostic criteria, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome, are often included among MUS conditions.2\n\nAlthough management of patients with MUS presents several challenges, GPs accept the responsibility for investigation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.5\n\nBiopsychosocial approaches are commonly applied in medical practice, whether the aim is full recovery or coping with symptoms and disability,1 and psychologically based interventions (especially different cognitive behavioural therapies [CBT]) have been developed for coping and symptom relief. Yet, such approaches do not substantiate MUS as a mental disorder. Lamahewa et al found, for example, that comorbidity with depression and generalised anxiety disorder occurred in only one-third of these patients.2 Studies have evaluated effects of CBT on different outcome measures, such as pain, function, work ability, or healthcare use, often presenting limited or no significant effects based on weak evidence.4\n\nMUS is not a clinical diagnosis but an analytical concept, unifying a diverse group of health problems where no joint cause or biomarker have been identified. Together MUS conditions dispute the idea that objective findings are needed to confirm subjective symptoms as disease. The biomedical disease model has imposed an unfortunate body–mind duality, with illness categorised as psychological when no objective findings are identified.2,4 Conceptualising MUS …",

      "title": "What treatment options exist for alcohol abuse?",
      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

      "title": "Revisiting a dilemma: repetitive pain vs. opioid exposures?",
      "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that cognitive/behavioural outcomes of ex-preterm children are worse than in term-born children. Various risk factors could explain these outcomes, including the triggers of preterm labour such as perinatal infections or inflammation, or birth asphyxia, hypoxic events due to recurrent apnoea/bradycardia, prolonged mechanical ventilation, hypothyroidism, hyperbilirubinemia, protein–calorie or micronutrient deficiencies, or drug therapies such as glucocorticoids, caffeine, theophylline, morphine and others. Extrapolating from clinical observations and animal studies, several hypotheses were floated to explain the neurodevelopmental impact of NICU care, such as neuroinflammation, nutritional deprivation, impaired neurogenesis or neuronal apoptosis/excitotoxicity 1. Postulating that reductions in pain and stress may improve outcomes, as in postsurgical neonates, opiates were investigated as one strategy for providing analgesia to the sickest and most preterm neonates 2, as they experience the most frequent and prolonged exposures to pain and/or stress. Given the absence of robust conclusive results, as well as limited follow-up studies of the preterm neonates originally enrolled in large multicentre trials, the question of whether opiate exposures promote or damage preterm brain development largely remains unanswered. To answer this question, Deindl et al. compared the in-hospital and 12-month follow-up outcomes for 140 ELBW infants (<1500 grams) before and after implementation of the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. Although cumulative opioid exposures increased sixfold between the control and intervention groups, they found no significant differences in their in-hospital and 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes 3. Multivariable regression analyses showed that the CRIB score at birth (p < 0.001) and cumulative opioid exposures in the NICU (p = 0.006) were associated with lower scores in the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS) of the Bayley Developmental Scales (2nd Edition). Although median CRIB scores were higher in the intervention group vs. the control group (7 vs. 4, p-value not reported) and regression estimates for CRIB scores were much greater than opioid exposures (−2.91 vs. −0.04), however, the authors concluded that ‘opiate exposure increased the risk for lower BRS scores in our study population’ 3. Predictive factors for the mental (MDI) and psychomotor (PDI) developmental indices were well supported by previously published literature and therefore not surprising. The authors contrast their results with those of the NEOPAIN study 4, while discounting the differences between the two study designs. Results from a single-centre, observational, retrospective case–cohort analysis using historical controls cannot be rationally compared with a prospective, multicentre, blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial using concurrent controls, which also selected patients using well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardised various other aspects of NICU care, other than randomising subjects to morphine or placebo infusions. These data, for example, are susceptible to significant selection bias, as only 15% of the original cohort (N = 949) or 38% of ELBW survivors (n = 367) contributed to the results reported in this study 3. All case–cohort comparisons with historical controls are notoriously open to unmeasured systematic bias that may result from myriad, known and unknown, temporal factors that may or may not be related to the intervention being studied. Given these limitations and those eruditely discussed by Diendl and colleagues, how important are the findings from this study? The results of this study are perhaps inadequate to dispel the rampant opiophobia prevailing in some NICUs, or an equally rampant opiophilia being practiced in others 5. The EUROPAIN study, for example, showed widely different sedation–analgesia practices between individual NICUs, within and between the 18 participating countries. Much of this clinical variability was driven by the use of opioids 5, rather than use of nonopioids or nonpharmacologic approaches. The current results, however, may serve to reassure clinicians that a systematic, protocol-driven approach to neonatal analgesia and sedation, one that incorporates routine assessments of pain/sedation using a validated scale, will very likely not lead to poorer short-term outcomes or major complications in ELBW infants. The jury is still out on the long-term effects of cumulative opioid exposures on preterm brain development, or their effects on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of premature birth. Despite multiple attempts, funding was not obtained to enable neurodevelopmental follow-up of subjects in the NEOPAIN multicentre trial. The Dutch morphine trial, modelled after the NEOPAIN protocol, however, has published a series of follow-up studies 6. A small pilot study, designed to demonstrate the feasibility of locating, contacting and recruiting school-age children from NEOPAIN many years after NICU discharge, reported preliminary findings on their long-term outcomes 7. Findings from this pilot study (N = 19) certainly cannot be related to the overall results from NEOPAIN (N = 898); thus, ascribing smaller head circumferences at 5–7 years 7 to delayed enteral feeding associated with morphine therapy in the neonatal period 4 lacks scientific validity. In the NEOPAIN trial, however, intermittent boluses of open-label morphine were associated with worse neurological outcomes 4, 8. Perhaps preterm neonates showing increased irritability, myoclonus or other clinical signs of severe IVH were misdiagnosed as having pain and thus given intravenous morphine boluses in addition to the masked study drug 4, 8. The fact that Diendl et al. found no increases in IVH among ELBW neonates despite sixfold increases in morphine exposure after their intervention, again, will reassure clinicians on the horns of this dilemma. The dilemma to treat neonatal pain with opioids, thereby courting potential risks for long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae is not unlike the effects of neonatal antibiotic use on gut microbiome and its association with subsequent inflammatory bowel disease. Yet concerns regarding analgesic use seem much greater than those regarding antibiotic use, although it is likely that preclinical evidence for anaesthetic-related neurotoxicity may have fuelled some of these concerns 9. Apart from one recent study 10, opioids had hitherto not been implicated with anaesthetic neurotoxicity in newborns – in animal or human studies. Zwicker et al. reported that a 10-fold increase in morphine exposure was associated with 5.5% reduction in cerebellar volume, which also correlated with poorer motor and cognitive outcomes 10. On the other hand, a large body of data have confirmed the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of repetitive neonatal pain. In conclusion, extravagant concerns with the immediate or long-term effects of neonatal opioids should not interfere with a real clinical need for opioid analgesia 6. Diendl et al. now provide additional evidence to support this conclusion. No conflict of interests to disclose regarding this publication.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

Dystonia is often classifi ed by etiology, which may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological defi cits or an identifi able structural or metabolic lesion. Etiological classifi cation of dystonia has undergone extensive modifi cations as genetic underpinnings for some forms of dystonia have been newly identifi ed [chap. 3]. Secondary dystonia may be further classifi ed into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia-plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifi able brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia-plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory fi ndings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Box 17.1).",

      "title": "Depression and Alcoholism: Clinical Considerations in Management",
      "abstract": "When alcohol abuse occurs with depression, both the substance abuse and the mood disorder necessitate treatment. These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

Drug abuse is associated with many medical problems and complications stemming both from regular use and from overdoses. Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal.

The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "CLINICAL FINDINGS IN THE USE OF TOFRĀNIL IN DEPRESSIVE AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC STATES",
      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a serious behavioral disorder. It is a long term evolving process characterized by dependency. It is not only biological and psychological but also social. It should be differentiated from occasional drug use, from drug abuse with minor consequences as well from medical drug dependency in which the individual does not seek a psychological effect. Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction. Depressive and psychotic disorders cause specific therapeutic problems when patients deny their troubles or when drug use produces special relief. These psychological disorders frequently underlie medical care needs.",

      "title": "Psychosis: impact on the patient and family.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

      "title": "TANGO2-Related Metabolic Encephalopathy and Arrhythmias",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias can present in acute metabolic crisis (hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, mild hyperammonemia) or with developmental delay, regression, and/or seizures. The acute presentation varies from profound muscle weakness, ataxia, and/or disorientation to a comatose state. Individuals can present with intermittent acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The first episode of myoglobinuria has been known to occur as early as age five months. Acute renal tubular damage due to myoglobinuria can result in acute kidney injury and renal failure. During acute illness, transient electrocardiogram changes can be seen; the most common is QT prolongation. Life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes occurs primarily during times of acute illness. Individuals who do not present in metabolic crises may present with gait incoordination, progressively unsteady gait, difficulty with speech, or clumsiness. Intellectual disability of variable severity is observed in almost all individuals. Seizures are observed outside the periods of crises in more than 75% of individuals. Hypothyroidism has been reported in more than one third of individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TANGO2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoidance of triggers for acute metabolic crisis (e.g., prolonged fasting, dehydration, ketogenic diet). Infusion of intravenous glucose during significant acute periods of systemic metabolic stress caused by infection or general anesthesia may be required to prevent significant catabolism. Prevention of secondary complications: Provide hydration and alkalinization of the urine during an attack of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria to prevent renal failure. An emergency plan should be in place to initiate steps to suppress acute catabolism and promote hydration in order to minimize the risk of life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. Prior to determining the rate and amount of fluid administration, an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function should be considered. Surveillance: Regular cardiology evaluation for management of cardiac arrhythmias; annual TSH and free T4; neurology follow up to manage epilepsy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting; dehydration; ketogenic diet, which can precipitate severe metabolic crises. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing to allow prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the TANGO2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Clinically, patients with Delirium Tremens (DT) and acute alcohol hallucinosis (impending DT) appear excited with vivid false perception. Cerebral blood flow and eeg correspondingly point to hyperexcitability in the CNS during these conditions. Clinical trials with barbital treatment in alcohol withdrawal shows that the amount of drug and the drug plasma concentration is the same no matter whether the physical signs of withdrawal are accompanied by hallucinations and clouding of consciousness. The psychotic signs in DT and acute alcoholic hallucinosis develops after many years of alcoholism as does seizures. We hypothesize that physical withdrawal is determined by the degree of physical dependence developed during the most recent drinking period whereas the psychotic signs and seizures are due to a cumulated CNS hyperactivity developed over many years of repeated alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. Changes of electrolyte concentrations in plasma or CSF do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of DT and related clinical states except that changes in calcium and inorganic phosphate metabolism indirectly point to changes in membrane excitability. A new model for a study of rapidly repeated intoxication and withdrawal episodes in rats has shown that repetition of episodes augments the convulsive component of withdrawal whereas the non-convulsive signs are dependent on the most recent episode only. The augmentation of the convulsive component correlates with regional differences in brain glucose consumption. Furthermore, synaptic proteins and acidic phospholipids may be involved in the development of CNS hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal. In conclusion both clinical and experimental studies indicate that severe alcohol withdrawal reactions may consist of two components: 1) Physical withdrawal signs determined by recent physical dependence. 2) A long term cumulated CNS hyperexcitability relating to seizures and psychotic signs during withdrawal. This state is elicited by alcohol withdrawal but it represents a cumulated and permanent or long lasting CNS dysfunction in alcoholics. The precise biochemical/pathophysiological mechanisms for the development of the two-component dysfunction still remain to be clarified in detail.",

      "title": "Autistic phenomena in neurotic patients 1",
      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced dystonia (DID) is a rarely diagnosed adverse reaction to a sufficiently large number of drugs. Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

      "title": "Excited delirium syndrome",
      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "The epidemiology and patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with recreational ketamine use",
      "abstract": "Ketamine was originally synthesised for use as a dissociative anaesthetic, and it remains widely used legitimately for this indication. However, there is increasing evidence of non-medical recreational use of ketamine, particularly in individuals who frequent the night-time economy. The population-level and sub-population (clubbers) prevalence of recreational use of ketamine is not known but is likely to be similar, or slightly lower than, that of other recreational drugs such as cocaine, MDMA, and amphetamine. The predominant features of acute toxicity associated with the recreational use of ketamine are neuro-behavioural abnormalities such as agitation, hallucinations, anxiety, and psychosis. Secondary to these, individuals put themselves at greater risk of physical harm/trauma. Cardiovascular features (hypertension and tachycardia) occur less frequently and the risk of death from recreational use is low and is predominately due to the physical harm/trauma. Long-term recreational use of ketamine can be associated with the development of psychological dependence and tolerance. There are reports of gastro-intestinal toxicity, particularly abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests, and of neuropsychiatric disorders, typically a schizophrenia-like syndrome, in long-term users. Finally, there are increasing reports of urological disorders, particularly haemorrhagic cystitis, associated with long-term use. The management of these problems associated with the long-term use of ketamine is largely supportive and abstinence from ongoing exposure to ketamine. In this review we will collate the available information on the epidemiology of recreational use of ketamine and describe the patterns of acute and chronic toxicity associated with its recreational use and the management of this toxicity.",

The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system. There is no (noticeable) loss of consciousness, enabling the patient's full recall (at times with suicidal attempts) (Pontius, 1981, 1984, 1987).

The great prevalence of depression in alcoholics constitutes an important clinical issue, because alcoholic subjects with a coexisting depression exhibit heavier alcohol abuse, severer physical damage and greater liability to both psychotropic drug abuse and overdose behaviour than non-depressive alcoholics. The former also experience more frequent and severer relapses and are at greater risk of suicide. The nature of the relationship between alcohol dependence and depressive disorders is of considerable theoretical significance. Three possible non-mutually exclusive types of association are discussed: (1) the ingestion of alcohol may be an attempt at self-medication of depressive symptoms; (2) depression and alcohol abuse may, independently of each other, be attributable to an underlying, possibly genetic, factor; (3) depression may be a result of alcoholism: either induced by heavy alcohol consumption, as a consequence of alcohol withdrawal or as a psychoreactive phenomenon. Clinical guidelines for pharmaco- and psychotherapy of depression in patients suffering from alcoholism are outlined.",

      "title": "Depression and anxiety: Distinguishing unipolar and bipolar disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "abstract": "The two primary symptoms of chronic ear disease are otorrhea and hearing loss. The goal of any tympanoplasty is to eradicate disease and improve hearing. These are the primary indications for this procedure. The success or failure of the surgery is influenced by many factors such as the age and general health of the patient, the extent and type of disease present, and whether the upper airway is functioning properly. Contraindications to tympanoplasty will vary from one surgeon to another depending upon his training, philosophy, experience, and surgical skill. It is helpful to think of these contraindications as being either absolute or relative. Absolute contraindications consist of: 1. uncontrolled cholesteatoma; 2. malignant tumors; 3. unusual infections and/or extenuating circumstances; and 4. complications of chronic ear disease, such as meningitis, brain abscess, or lateral sinus thrombosis. Relative contraindications are less well defined: 1. eustachian tube insufficiency or non-function; 2. the uncooperative patient; 3. the dead ear; 4. the better hearing or only hearing ear; 5. the elderly patient; 6. the young child; and 7. the repeated failure case. The otologic surgeon must exercise good clinical judgment in selecting patients for tympanoplasty. This paper deals with some of the more common problems in decision making.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a syndrome characterized by impairments in social relatedness, language and communication, a need for routine and sameness, abnormal movements, and sensory dysfunction. Mercury (Hg) is a toxic metal that can exist as a pure element or in a variety of inorganic and organic forms and can cause immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with autism. Thimerosal, a preservative frequently added to childhood vaccines, has become a major source of Hg in human infants and toddlers. According to the FDA and the American Academy of Pediatricians, fully vaccinated children now receive, within their first two years, Hg levels that exceed safety limits established by the FDA and other supervisory agencies. A thorough review of medical literature and U.S. government data indicates (i) that many and perhaps most cases of idiopathic autism, in which an extended period of developmental normalcy is followed by an emergence of symptoms, are induced by early exposure to Hg; (ii) that this type of autism represents a unique form of Hg poisoning (HgP); (iii) that excessive Hg exposure from thimerosal in vaccine injections is an etiological mechanism for causing the traits of autism; (iv) that certain genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some children; and (v) that vaccinal Hg in thimerosal is causing a heretofore unrecognized mercurial syndrome.",

At first both patients showed no response to being addressed or to pain stimuli. They presented an upward eye gaze deviation, cardiorespiratory functions were stable. Following extensive diagnostic procedures revealing no organic cause for the clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of a hysterical consciousness disorder was stated. Symptoms of conversion neuroses include lacking call response, gait disorder, seizure-like conditions and strength diminution in one or more extremities. In these cases suspicious facts are the absence of injuries (for example by falling down or tongue bite during a dissociative attack), eye gaze deviation and the phenomenon that, when the patient's arm is raised above the head and let fall, it never hits the face but glides down beside the body.",

      "abstract": "The half-life of a drug is the time taken for the blood level of the drug to fall by half, provided that no more doses of the drug are administered in the intervening period. Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "title": "Sensing metabolomics landscape unfold molecular connectivity between mental illness and drug abuse",
      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse.

They can be determined by the action of various influences and their interactions on functional development of the brain. There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders. The article provides review on most significant neurobehavioral manifestations of developmental impairment of the brain during prenatal, perinatal and early postnatal period. The most known adverse factors causing developmental neurobehavioral dysfunctions in humans as well as in experimental animals are discussed.",

A careful study might reveal the cause of some cranial nerve syndromes of unknown etiology such as tic douloureux, Bell's palsy, facial hemispasm, certain types of deafness, tinnitus, vertigo, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, and spasmodic torticollis. The first (olfactory) nerve is susceptible to nasal or viral infections which can cause transitory and occasionally permanent loss of smell. The second nerve (optic) is sensitive to methanol, optochin, cortisone and cortisone-like substances, tobacco (nicotine), quinine, ethylene glycol (Prestone), aspidium, and other substances. The third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves (oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens) are often involved in diabetes and syphilis. They are occasionally affected following spinal anesthesia.

Herein, the pharmacology of DFE was reviewed, and questions relevant to medicolegal investigations were addressed. Particular emphasis was given to detection time in biological specimens and the range, onset and duration of effects. DFE may be abused as an inhalant and is rapidly absorbed through the lungs. Onset of central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects is within seconds and the duration may only last minutes. The effects may lead to impairment of human performance, including confusion, lethargy, impaired judgment, loss of motor coordination and loss of consciousness. Death may result even after the first use. With heavy use or in combination with other CNS depressants, extended periods of drowsiness or loss of consciousness may be observed with an increased risk of a fatal event. A majority of impaired driving investigations where DFE was identified included a collision demonstrating the significant impact its use may have on traffic safety. When DFE is identified alone, without other drugs that cause CNS impairment, the effects may not be observable minutes after the crash, making identification of its use difficult. Although concentrations dissipate rapidly, DFE has been detected in blood specimens collected up to 3 hours after the driving incident. Two studies on passive exposure presented herein demonstrated that it is unlikely to detect DFE above concentrations of ∼2.6 µg/mL in blood or urine due to even extreme unintentional exposure. Alternative specimens such as brain, lung and tracheal air should be considered in some postmortem investigations. DFE has been identified in blood specimens from postmortem cases at concentrations from 0.14 to 460 µg/mL and in impaired driving cases from 0.16 to 140 µg/mL.",

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

      "title": "The influence of stress on the transition from drug use to addiction.",
      "abstract": "Stress--that is, any type of stimulus that challenges the organism's normal internal balance--induces a physiologic response involving a variety of hormones and other signaling molecules that act on, among other organs, the brain. This stress response also can influence the progression of alcohol and other drug (AOD) addiction through various stages. For example, AODs can directly activate the stress response. In turn, certain stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and corticotrophin-releasing factor) also act on the brain system that mediates the rewarding experiences associated with AOD use (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system). Moreover, elevated glucocorticoid levels and stress increase AOD self-administration in certain animal models. During a later stage of the addiction process, in contrast, excessive and/or prolonged stress may impair the reward system, inducing heavier AOD use to maintain the rewarding experience. During the final stage of addiction, when the addicted person experiences withdrawal symptoms if no drug is consumed, chronic AOD use results in gross impairment of the normal stress response and other signaling mechanisms in the brain, resulting in a state of anxiety and internal stress. At this stage, people continue to use AODs mainly to relieve this negative-affect state.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant.

Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "title": "Current Treatment for Generalized Convulsive Status Epilepticus in Adults.",
      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a seizure lasting longer than 5 min, or at least two seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them. Early emergent medical management consists of life support and an etiology survey, and subsequent treatment can be classified into 4 stages: (1) early SE, (2) established SE, (3) refractory SE, and (4) super-refractory SE. For early SE, benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, are the agents of choice, given to terminate the seizure activity rapidly. For established SE (20-30 min after SE onset), the therapeutic strategy is to give parental antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. At the stage of refractory SE (1-2 hours after SE onset), the conventional treatment is induction of general anesthesia using midazolam or propofol. Superrefractory SE is defined as SE that continues, or recurs, for at least 24 hours after the onset of anesthetic therapy. In addition to treatments used in established and refractory SE, other potentially effective therapies include ketamine, magnesium, inhalational anesthetics, immunotherapy, ketogenic diet, induced hypothermia, and neurosurgery. The principle of SE therapy is rapid seizure control and correction of underlying problems. Future well-designed clinical trials are mandatory to establish the standard treatment, especially in settings of established, refractory, and super-refractory SE.",

      "title": "Hyperventilation Syndrome: A Review",
      "abstract": "This article has dealt with the psychophysiological phenomenon known as \"hyperventilation syndrome.\" Published research on this syndrome dates back at least a century to Da Costa's classic investigation involving \"soldier's heart\". Various labels such as \"effort syndrome,\" \"anxiety neurosis,\" \"neurocirculatory asthenia,\" \"vasoregulatory asthenia,\" and \"irritable heart,\" have been employed over the past century to describe this syndrome. The use of different labels to describe this syndrome seems to be inappropriate. While the symptoms associated with these diagnostic labels appear to be remarkably similar, the treatment for the syndrome often differs as a function of the diagnostic label. Symptoms include breathlessness or dyspnea with effort, parathesia, trembling, tachycardia, tetany, carpopedal spasms, and convulsions in the case of a full-blown attack. Hyperventilation, a normal consequence of vigorous exercise and/or high temperatures, can often occur in some individuals for no apparent reason. Hyperventilation, and the resulting physiological changes, are often associated with decrements in psychomotor performance along with increased error rates. The symptoms which characterize the hyperventilation syndrome can be readily produced in certain \"types\" of individuals within minutes by requiring the individual to overbreathe or through introduction of a CO2 challenge. The symptoms, once produced, can be quickly reversed by placing a paper sack over the subject's head and requiring him/her to rebreathe expired air. Overbreathing and CO2 challenges do not, however, produce full-blown hyperventilatory attacks in most individuals. That is, some individuals or \"types\" appear to be especially sensitive to the effects of overbreathing and/or CO2 loading.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

We presented a male patient, aged 50, hospital- ized in the Emergency Center Kragujevac due to altered mental status (Glasgow Coma Score 11), partial respiratory in- sufficiency (pO2 7.5 kPa, pCO2 4.3 kPa, SpO2 89 %), weak- ness of lower extremities and atypical electrocardiographic changes.

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "abstract": "The effects of LSD are characterized by a number of disturbances of perception and experience, which can be observed in the fields of visual, spatial and temporal perception and of affectivity. We also see disturbances of experience, which can otherwise be observed only in psychoses, for example reduction or change of cognitive functions, but also depersonalization and euphoria. In atypical courses of intoxication (\"horror-trips\") anxiety and excitement are predominant. Atypical courses of intoxication may be interrupted by \"talk down\" and additional application of tranquilizers. In a certain number of LSD-users in our clinic we saw psychoses. We classify them into flash-backs, exogenic (toxic) psychoses and so-called \"endoform psychoses\". The latter implies three possible constellations: accidental coincidence of LSD-use and psychosis; pre-existing psychosis with symptomatic use of LSD as an attempt of self-treatment; finally the onset of a psychosis may be triggered by the use of the halluzinogen. From the symptomatological cross-section they cannot reliably be distinguished from real schizophrenia. An independent nosological unit \"LSD-psychosis\" does not seem to exist.",

      "title": "Effect of Dalak (Massage) in the Management of Sahar (Insomnia)",
      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "title": "The exogenous model of psychotic experience induced by novel psychoactive substances: A clinical overview",
      "abstract": "The previous two decades have been marked by profound societal transformations, including ongoing developments in the illegal drug market and the emergence of numerous novel psychoactive substances. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse clinical presentations of psychopathological conditions, particularly within the domain of psychotic symptoms, remains deficient. In this clinical overview, our aim is to provide a detailed analysis of the psychotic manifestations induced by various substances. Exogenous psychoses may present with visual hallucinations, delusional perceptions, and paranoid ideation, frequently accompanied by an ego-dystonic experience that deviate from an individual's customary self-identity. Variations in the presentation of symptoms are also influenced by the specific pharmacological pathways with which the substance interacts. Visual hallucinations characterized by vivid colours and associated with positive or negative emotional experiences are most frequently linked to the serotonergic pathway. Paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations are primarily associated with the dopaminergic pathways. Dissociative responses, often characterized by feelings of derealization and somatopsychic depersonalization, are typically elicited through glutamatergic pathways. Lastly, the endocannabinoid pathways are associated with anxiety-related psychosis-like states, ideas of reference, grandiose delusions, and paranoid delusions.",

Over 100,000 American veterans of Desert Storm/Shield (approximately 15% of deployed U. S. Armed Forces) returned from the Persian Gulf and slowly (6-24 months or more) presented with a variety of complex signs and symptoms characterized by disabling fatigue, intermittent fevers, night sweats, arthralgia, myalgia, impairments in short-term memory, headaches, skin rashes, intermittent diarrhea, abdominal bloating, chronic bronchitis, photophobia, confusion, transient visual scotomata, irritability and depression and other signs and symptoms that until recently have defied appropriate diagnoses (1-3). These symptoms are not localized to any one organ, and the signs and symptoms and routine laboratory test results are not consistent with a single, specific disease (1). The signs and symptoms of GWI have been reported by 27/28 of the Coalition Armed Forces that were deployed against Iraqi units in Kuwait and Southern Iraq. The only exception is France. This brief review will summarize some of the possible exposures that occurred, the types of illnesses that resulted from these exposures, and some of the treatments that have been used on GWI patients.

Delirium is usually temporary and reversible and does not reflect a persistent psychiatric disorder.1 Delirium may result from a general medical condition, from use of drugs or similar substances, or from withdrawal from these substances. Some researchers suggest that there are two forms of delirium: hyperactive (agitated) and hypoactive (lethargic). If individuals with delirium experience the hyperactive form, they may be more prone to hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and disorientation. The rate is higher in elderly persons, those with cancer, and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients who have had an operation (especially heart surgery, hip surgery, and organ transplants), as well as patients with burns, dialysis, or central nervous system lesions, are at increased risk for delirium. It is very common in individuals with terminal illnesses, often occurring just before death.4 we conducted this study to see the aetiological profile of Acute Confusional State in patients admitted in medical wards in IGMC Shimla and to study the behavior pattern of such patients.",

El diagnóstico de Trastorno de Evitación y Restricción de la Ingesta de Alimentos, (ARFID, de sus siglas en inglés) fue incluido en el Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de Trastornos Mentales, 5ta Edición (DSM-5) el año 2013, como un nuevo diagnóstico dentro de los Trastornos Alimentarios y de Ingesta (TAI) para describir un grupo de pacientes que tienen conductas alimentarias evitativas o restrictivas que no están motivadas por una alteración de la imagen corporal o un deseo de adelgazar. Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial. Se describen tres formas de presentación que pueden ocurrir en conjunto o de manera independiente: (i) Niños con aversiones sensoriales (selectivos), que rechazan algunas comidas por sus sabores, texturas, olores o formas; (ii) otros que presentan inapetencia, baja ingesta o poco interés en alimentarse (ingesta limitada); (iii) y los que rechazan algunos alimentos o dejan de comer después de un evento traumático asociado (aversivos). Debido a la incorporación reciente del diagnóstico al DSM-5, existe aún escasa evidencia respecto a su enfrentamiento. El propósito de esta revisión es clarificar criterios diagnósticos, y exponer un manejo progresivo de enfrentamiento y tratamiento, con un enfoque multidisciplinario, sin ahondar en la resolución de las causas médicas orgánicas.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "In Italy, as in other countries, an apparently increasing number of subjects is reporting a variety of subjective symptoms that the subjects themselves refer to the exposure to electric, magnetic or electromagnetic fields (EMF) from nearby electric appliances, cellular phones, antennas, etc. Terms like electricity hypersensitivity (EHS), EMF hypersensitivity, or other similar, are frequently adopted to describe such symptoms; nevertheless, up to now, these terms are not entered the medical terminology. No accepted diagnostic criteria or procedures for the diagnosis of EHS are currently available. Furthermore, apart from the subject's self-attribution of the symptoms to EMFs, no direct cause-effect relationship between EHS symptoms and electromagnetic fields has been proved; additionally, evidence of a possible pathogenetic mechanism is lacking. In this paper, two cases developing symptoms of EHS ascribed to overhead power line in the proximity of their house are discussed. Nervous system (asthenia, depression, paraesthesias etc.), cardiovascular system (cardiac palpitations) and the skin (tingling, itching, etc.), are mostly (but not exclusively) involved. Based on available scientific knowledge, the rationale for an approach to subjects claiming for EHS is discussed. The establishment of a National archive for the collection of cases is communicated.",

      "title": "Depression associated with stroke",
      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "title": "Choreoathetosis and Infracortical Nervous Mechanisms",
      "abstract": "During the last twenty-five years it has come to be recognized that a fairly large amount of mental deficiency appears to coincide with or result from faulty intracranial myelination. In some such children little or no post-natal development occurs, in others recession is already occurring at birth; a few remain fairly normal for some years. Spastic contractures, especially of the legs, grow progressively worse, epilepsy may appear, the child goes steadily downhill and early death is the usual termination. In some cases choreoathetosis is present, and this may either, if the patient lives long enough, disappear spontaneously, or, more usually, become impossible when the spastic contractures have immobilized the extremities. Post-mortem one finds one of two conditions—demyelination of the brain (the status dysmyelinatus of Hallervorden-Spatz) or hypermyelination (the status marmoratus of the Vogts). In both forms there is much hypergliosis, evidently secondary to some irritating but slow myelin poison which finally produces anoxia. Clinically during life both varieties appear much the same, and that is all that is known about its nature at present. Cases were recorded by the Vogts in 1920, Hallervorden and Spatz in 1922, Kalinowski in 1927, Helfand in 1931, Spatz and Peters in 1938; in this country by Meyer and Cook in 1936, Meyer and Earl in 1936. By these authors the views of others are summarized—Bielschowski, Loewenberg and Malamud, Urechia and Michalescu, Bouché and Van Bogaert, Casper, Ammosow, Bostroem, Bodechtel and Guttmann. If epilepsy has been present, it generally disappears after some years. By no means all cases end up as helpless idiots; some learn to attend to their own wants, but few ever walk freely.",

      "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis is underestimated as a cause of suffering and diminished quality of life in children and adolescents. If nasal symptoms such as itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and congestion are not well controlled during the day, they may contribute to learning problems during school hours. If these symptoms are not well controlled during the night, they may contribute to nocturnal sleep loss, secondary daytime fatigue and learning impairment. Even uncomplicated seasonal allergic rhinitis may be associated with reduced ability to learn, and the likelihood of learning problems may increase in severe perennial rhinitis or in rhinitis associated with complications such as sinusitis or eustachian tube dysfunction and conductive hearing loss. Also, many of the medications used to treat allergic rhinitis may cause central nervous system adverse effects and contribute to learning impairment. For some medications, such as inhaled glucocorticoids and decongestants, the potential effect on central nervous system function and learning has not been tested. For others such as H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines), well-designed, prospective studies have been performed. The newer relatively nonsedating medications such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine have less potential to impair central nervous system function and learning than their predecessors.",

Also, children and adolescents, females, people with learning disabilities, or people who experience violence in the home seem to have a greater risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic event. The websites of psychiatry organizations describe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as ranging from sleeplessness, nightmares to grief and depression – with accompanying physical signs such as headaches and irregular heartbeats. Such symptoms may gradually subside after a while; including chronic irritability, feelings of constantly being under threat, overeating, and alcohol abuse, perhaps dependency on tranquillizers or painkillers.",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

PTSD can also occur after the unexpected death of a family member or close friend, following a serious harm or threat of death or injury to a loved one, or in case of divorce or unemplyoement.

Symptoms are grouped in three main categories: re-experiencing the event, accompanied by anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks; persistent avoidance of any reminders of the event, feeling detached or estranged from others; persistent anxiety and/or physical reactivity. As treatment, besides various psychotherapy techniques, various classes of psychotropic drugs are used, such as morphine, antipsychotics, usual or atypical antidepressants, anticonvulsants, to reduce anxiety, avoidance, nightmares and hyperexcitability.",

In addition to doses lower than those used for oral treatment, a more rapid onset of therapeutic effect and a better tolerance, the beneficial effect seems also to depend on the setting in which the treatment takes place. Infusion-therapy is a combined pharmacopsychotherapeutic procedure. Next to infusion-treatment a pretreatment with neuroleptics is advised either via the oral or parenteral route. In extremely refractory depression the infusion-therapy can be applied twice a day; in some cases we resort to continuous infusion for a few days. Infusion-therapy is not applicable in patients prone to epileptic seizures or with serious cerebral dysfunction with a risk of delirium. In case of doubt an EEG is mandatory.

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury.

Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "abstract": "LeGros TL, Murphy-Lavoie H. Hyperbaric Treatment of Air or Gas Embolism: Current Recommendations. Undersea Hyperb Med. 2024 Fourth Quarter; 51(4):425-448. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) presents as the abrupt onset of hearing loss. Approximately 88% of SSNHL has no identifiable etiology and is termed idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) [1]. Hearing specialists have investigated ISSHL since the 1970s. Over the past 30 years, more than 800 articles, or one every two weeks, have been published in the English medical literature [2]. ISSHL is the abrupt onset of hearing loss, usually unilaterally and upon wakening, that involves a hearing loss of at least 30 decibels (dB) occurring within three days over at least three contiguous frequencies [3-4]. As most patients do not present with premorbid audiograms, the degree of hearing loss is usually defined by the presentation thresholds of the unaffected ear [4]. Other associated symptoms include tinnitus, aural fullness, dizziness and vertigo [4-5]. The historical incidence of ISSHL ranges from 5–20 cases/100,000 population, with approximately 4,000 new cases per annum in the United States [4,6]. The true incidence is thought to be higher, as ISSHL is thought to be underreported. Interestingly, 4,000 cases annually calculate to 1.3 cases/ 100,000 in the United States; therefore, an incidence of 5–20/100,000 would translate to &gt; 15,000 new ISSHL cases per annum in the United States. Recent literature has placed the annual ISSHL incidence in the United States as 27 cases/100,000, with a pediatric incidence of 11 cases/100,000 [7]. Other studies report that the incidence is increasing (160/100,000), especially in the elderly (77/100,000), and conclude that ISSHL is no longer rare [7-9]. In 1984, Byl reviewed the literature and found the mean age of ISSHL presentation to be 46–49 years, with variation of incidence with age and an equal gender distribution [6,10-13]. The presentation of ISSHL does not appear to have seasonal variations, uneven distributions of presentation throughout the year, or an association with upper respiratory infections, either prior to or following symptom onset [14]. The spontaneous recovery is currently thought to be 30–60% [15-17].",

      "title": "Post-Stroke Apathy: An Exploratory Longitudinal Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (&amp;#x03C7;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

Laboratory tests may be considered to assess for significant comorbidities, differential diagnoses, or contraindications to treatment. Management of MDD depends on its severity and may include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. The drugs most commonly used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Treatment should be continued for at least 16 to 24 weeks to prevent recurrence.

      "abstract": "Introduction and objectives Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in a variety of neuropsychiatric disturbances ranging from subtle deficits to severe intellectual and emotional disturbances, including cognitive impairments, mood and psychotic disorders and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and TBI are closely related. The reward-mediated behaviors central to alcohol addiction seem to interact with the cognitive dysfunction of TBI. First, a significant proportion of patients with TBI have a history of alcohol abuse. Second, AUD might jeopardize TBI recovery and trigger or lower seizures threshold. Third, both AUD and TBI share a negative impact on mental functioning (from memory and cognitive performance to mood impairment). Finally, there is some limited and recent evidence that TBI can increase AUD in patients with no history of substance use prior to the injury, by disrupting incentive-motivation neurocircuitry. Methods We aim to present a 27-year-old Portuguese male patient without prior psychiatric history who developed AUD and epilepsy after TBI (from a work-related fall). Results After 3 years of treatment, the patient's hasn’t achieved abstinence. His treatment included pharmacological therapy with mood stabilizers, flufenazine injections and naltrexone, psychotherapy and rehabilitative interventions. Conclusions Given the sparse knowledge about this dual diagnosis, the approach of AUD after TBI is still challenging and the best treatment remains to be determined. Monitoring alcohol consumption should be considered in all patients presenting with TBI. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Trihexyphenidyl Use Disorder and Withdrawal Syndrome",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic drug commonly used in treating movement disorders.[1] The widespread use of trihexyphenidyl has led to the exploration of its abuse potential due to its anxiolytic, euphoriant, hallucinogenic, and sexual stimulant effects.[2] It is a popular drug of abuse among the thrill-seeking adolescent male population, used either orally or smoked in a powdered form mixed with tobacco.[3] The prevalence of trihexyphenidyl abuse has been reported to vary from 6.5% to 34% among schizophrenia patients, with doses of trihexyphenidyl abuse varying from 28 mg/day to as high as 200 mg/day.[4] The risk factors for trihexyphenidyl abuse are male gender, unemployment, concomitant use of other illicit substances, family history of substance dependence, long-term use of trihexyphenidyl, and severe mental disorders.[4] The most common aim of abuse is anxiolysis, sedation, or a mood-enhancing euphoric effect to alleviate depressive and negative symptoms.[4] Even though trihexyphenidyl dependence has been previously described, the literature is scanty as it may mimic a primary psychiatric illness leading to misdiagnosis further compounded by a lack of awareness about the drug's abuse potential. We describe a case where prescribed trihexyphenidyl use gradually progressed to a use disorder, leading to social, financial, occupational, and biological dysfunctions. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old male with a history of possible dissociative episodes of unresponsiveness associated with anxiety, currently in remission and off all medications, presented to the psychiatry outpatient department with the inability to stop consuming trihexyphenidyl tablets. For the past 4 years, the patient has had bilateral fine hand tremors, for which tablet trihexyphenidyl was initiated for possible essential tremors, titrated to 4–5 mg per day. After 2 years of regular use, he noticed that his tremor completely resolved after the trihexyphenidyl dose and would aggravate after 4–5 h of the last dose of trihexyphenidyl, along with slurring of speech. Over the next year, the use frequency increased to more than 6–8 mg per day as the duration of relief from tremors decreased with each dose. He started experiencing other difficulties whenever the effect of trihexyphenidyl wore out, such as a generalized feeling of the slowness of movements, stiffness in body parts, difficulty walking, and difficulty in writing. Patient's writing samples, with and without consumption of trihexyphenidyl are attached in Figure 1. Simultaneously, he also noticed that trihexyphenidyl ingestion made him feel energetic, increased his self-confidence, and made him happier. He would get a high with its consumption and described it as if \"everything was possible\" for him. He took trihexyphenidyl first thing in the morning to get out of bed and start his day. He would also spend more money under the effect of trihexyphenidyl than his usual self, would at times be involved in activities that caused him financial harm, such as lending money to people recklessly and also experienced substantially increased libido. Over the next few months, he noticed that after the effects of THP waned off, he would start to experience low mood, reduced interest in carrying out activities, would feel that life is vain, had to struggle with all the movements and started to have suicidal ideations. Later, he started using trihexyphenidyl without prescription at about 10–12 mg per day in divided doses, sourcing it from his workplace pharmacy. He experienced side effects of the medication, like dry mouth, but chose to ignore it to alleviate the depressive symptoms. A representation of illness graph of the patient is given in Figure 2.Figure 1: Handwriting samples of the patient before and after taking a dose of trihexyphenidyl. The image is not reused from any source or copyrightFigure 2: Illness graph of the patient. THP: Trihexyphenidyl, TDS: thrice dailyOn examination, he had fine bilateral hand tremors, the speech was slurred, facial expressions were reduced, gait with a forward stooped posture and bradykinesia. On mental status examination, depressed affect and decreased self-esteem were present. He had taken trihexyphenidyl 4 h before this examination. Various differential diagnoses were considered and ruled out systematically. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was ruled out due to nonspecific motor symptoms and symptom onset only after trihexyphenidyl withdrawal. Drug-induced Parkinson's was ruled out as the current symptoms from the past 4 years have been without the use of any neuroleptics. Vascular Parkinsonism was ruled out due to prominent upper limb involvement and a normal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Wilson's disease evaluation was negative. With a provisional diagnosis of trihexyphenidyl use disorder based on tolerance, craving, and use despite harm and withdrawals, he was started on tablet escitalopram 5 mg and up-titrated to 10 mg to counter the depressive and anxiety symptoms during withdrawal; tablet propranolol 20 mg was started to manage the tremors, and trihexyphenidyl tapered slowly over 6 months. At the follow-up, he had decreased trihexyphenidyl dose gradually to 2 mg per day without any withdrawal. He maintained well without any tremors. Written consent was obtained from the patient for publication as a case report. DISCUSSION DSM 5 recognizes the antiparkinsonian drugs (including trihexyphenidyl) abuse under the \"other (or unknown) substance use disorder\" category. ICD 10 did not clarify any such category, and ICD 11 describes \"disorder due to use of other specified psychoactive substances including medications.\" However, it does not describe the classes of medications. Hence, whether nonprescription misuse of trihexyphenidyl should be regarded as psychoactive substance use is still questionable. The euphorigenic effects of trihexyphenidyl can be explained by the inhibition of dopamine reuptake and storage consequent to the strong muscarinic receptor blockade[4] as well as its increased affinity for dopamine receptors in the limbic area at higher dosages. Thus, it stimulates the central nervous reward system leading to a \"high.\"[5] Similar stimulant effects have been described with other anticholinergics, such as biperiden and procyclidine.[6] However, tolerance to these effects also develops fast, compelling the patient to increase the doses, which may lead to exaggerating its adverse effects and psychosis-like behavior alterations.[4] This anticholinergic abuse has also been associated with withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal of anticholinergic drugs in Parkinson's disease often markedly exacerbates Parkinsonian symptoms, movement disorders,[7] depressive or dysphoric mood symptoms, and even results in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.[8] This could be due to acetylcholine receptor hypersensitivity in response to long-term anticholinergic use. The sudden anticholinergic withdrawal might worsen the severity of the symptoms than the initial presentation.[9] A similar phenomenon was observed in our patient, who developed motor symptoms following the discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl. Ruberg et al.[10] in 1982 reported increased acetylcholine receptor densities in the frontal lobes of patients on anticholinergics; similar changes are expected to be seen in nigrostriatal cholinergic receptors.[9] The hypersensitive cholinergic receptor state is similar to the cholinergic excess stage in Parkinsonism, leading to various movement dysfunctions. However, it is essential to mention that going by this mechanism of action, all anticholinergics would have an abuse potential, which is not evident. Therefore, the exact pathophysiological mechanism is yet to be elicited. An image representing possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal is given in Figure 3.Figure 3: Possible mechanisms of anticholinergic intoxication and withdrawal effects. Ach: Acetylcholine, DA: Dopamine, \"rec\": ReceptorsIn this case, evidence suggesting trihexyphenidyl withdrawal-induced movement and mood disorders is the presence of a temporal relationship between trihexyphenidyl dosing and symptom onset which appears to be very similar to the \"on-off\" phenomenon seen with levodopa use in patients of Parkinson's disease. Among various management options, one study suggests tapering 1 mg of trihexyphenidyl every 2 weeks. Another deprescribing guideline by the University of Sydney and Macquarie University recommends a relatively slow tapering, reducing 25% of the daily dose in 1–4 weeks, depending on the nature and severity of withdrawal symptoms, and ending the treatment 2 weeks after giving the lowest dose. Nonpharmacological support such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, exercise, and social support should be given. If tapering is ineffective, consider switching to another anticholinergic agent, with minimal side effects. Tapering off trihexyphenidyl within 3 months of starting has been recommended.[5] Therefore, in light of such reported cases, it is essential to realize that easy affordability, availability, and prolonged prescription would lead to easy escalation of trihexyphenidyl doses leading to potential misuse among patients and this needs to be dealt with caution.

      "abstract": "The usual phenomena of cannabis intoxication include experiences which in a non-intoxicated state would be considered as psychiatric symptoms. These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

We present two case reports to highlight the occurrence of co-morbid psychopathology in association with antihistamine abuse and dependence.<br>Case I used high doses of pheniramine for about 2 years and became suspicious of his wife; he even doubted the paternity of his yet-to-be-born child. The associated behavioural abnormalities suggested that he was acting out on the delusion. He also had seizures associated with the intake of a high dose of pheniramine. Case II had multiple substance use, and dependence on alcohol and pheniramine. He demonstrated abnormal behaviour suggestive of psychosis and organic brain syndrome that persisted for a few days and remitted on discontinuation of the substances. These two cases demonstrate the occurrence of psychotic syndromes associated with heavy pheniramine use. The psychopathology can vary from an independent psychotic syndrome to an organic brain syndrome-like disorder.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream.

      "abstract": "Among the cases in my note-books I find quite a considerable number where injuries, especially falls, producing quite severe blows upon the back alone, upon the head, or upon the back and head together, have been the apparent cause of grave symptoms, involving the mind or the general nervous system, or both.I find that the gravity of the resulting disease does not depend upon the severity of the primary injury, nor upon the intensity of the pain and other indications of mischief immediately following.The character of the disorder, whether spinal, cerebral, or general, has not in these cases depended upon the locality of the original disturbance, whether of the head or of the back.Of two cases of delusional mental disease, one, which re- sulted in recovery, was, I think, the direct outcome of a fall in a skating-rink, whereby the back of the head received a sharp blow not causing even momentary unconsciousness.The second was slowly developed through slight mental confusion, irritability, hardly dis- tinguishable change of character, suspicion, jealousy, and fear of personal injury into delusional mental dis- ease, remaining now, in the fifth year, an incurable insanity, which originated in a succession of violent blows to the back, but no injury to the head, from falling down stairs.A large number of cases of epilepsy and a few cases of general paralysis of the insane were thought, to have been the direct consequence of blows or other injuries, for the most part of the head, but to a less extent of the back.Chorea, too, aud the group of symptoms classed under the head of spinal irritation, neuras- thenia, and now and then hebephrenia, had their origin",

      "abstract": "A stressor above a threshold magnitude, or multiple stressors applied simultaneously, cause an organism to alter its behaviour and physiology, with the aim of maintaining homeostasis. The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

The abstinence phenomena in both patients responded dramatically to reintoxication with glutethimide followed by cautious, gradual withdrawal. Other reports of withdrawal-like phenomena following acute and chronic intoxication are reviewed and discussed. It is the authors' opinion, based on strong clinical evidence, that glutethimide, like other sedatives, can produce tolerance, habituation, and addiction in some subjects when taken in amounts greater than 2.5 gm. daily. Most careful supervision of patients who are being given this useful sedative over a prolonged period is recommended.",

Regardless of sensory modality, disorders of the special senses in the elderly can be conveniently divided into conductive, sensorineural, and central disorders. Disorders of the chemosensory senses, smell and taste, are usually less disabling than disorders of the other special senses (vision and hearing). Nevertheless, olfactory impairment is a significant contributor to perceived disability and lower quality of life among elderly patients and is a significant predictor of subsequent cognitive decline. Gustatory disorders in the elderly that are not secondary to olfactory disorders should prompt consideration of systemic factors, such as medication use, toxin exposures and autoimmune disorders.",

Methanol is water-soluble and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier (1).Methanol poisoning has a rare incidence, however, it presents with a high morbidity and mortality. Generally, it is encountered after an attempted suicide or an accidental intake. Methanol poisoning affects the optic nerve and central nervous system, particularly the basal ganglia, potentially leading to visual impairment, blindness, diz-ziness, seizures, and coma (2, 3). Patients present with symptoms such as blindness, motor dysfunction, rigidity, hypokinesia, and other Parkinson-like signs (2, 4). In this study, we aimed to underscore the importance of MRI findings in a patient that presented with late signs of serious intoxication in whom we were unable to evaluate serum methanol and ethanol levels.

All describe an idiopathic syndrome characterized by disabling fatigue and other symptoms occurring chronically and exacerbated by minimal exertion. Aetiology and pathogenesis—it is likely that multiple factors operate to predispose, precipitate, and perpetuate CFS: (1) predisposing factors—some individuals may be predisposed to develop CFS by virtue of genetics, personality, or other vulnerability; (2) precipitating factors—the condition may be precipitated by factors such as infection or psychological stresses; (3) perpetuating factors—for practical management the most important factors are those that perpetuate the illness and consequently act as barriers to recovery, including modifiable psychological, biological, behavioural, and social factors. Studies have reported a variety of biological abnormalities: few have been confirmed, but the most robust are (1) altered brain function, and (2) reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness, although it is not clear if these are primary or secondary to inactivity....",

      "abstract": "Desynchronization of circadian rhythmicity resulting from rapid travel through at least four time zones leads to symptoms known in everyday English as jet-lag. The most detrimental effect of jet-lag is fatigue with poor alertness and psychomotor performance. Severity is subject to individual variation in susceptibility (morning/evening typology, age,...) and environmental factors (direction of travel, number of time zones crossed, psychosocial environment...). Many measures used to prevent or reduce jet lag are inappropriate or ineffective and some may even be dangerous, such as use of melatonin. One of the most reliable preventive techniques consists of reinforcing social synchronizers by maintaining exposure to sunlight and social activity. Only two drugs currently available on the market can be recommended, i.e. non-benzodiazepinic hypnotics which induce high quality sleep to allow quick recovery and a new time-release caffeine agent which has been shown to prolong psychomotor performance.",

Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "abstract": "Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances with a distinct physiological effect that changes the function of the brain resulting in a temporary change of perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Such substances are often used recreationally, which may consequently lead to mental and/or physical addiction. Psychological addiction is a state of internal coercion for occasional or regular consumption of addictive drugs to create feelings of comfort or to avoid discomfort, and represents a sign of loss of control. Physical dependence is the state of adaptation of the organism to the addictive agent and manifests itself with characteristic disorders of physical and psychological nature at the cessation or significant reduction of the intake of psychoactive substances. There are numerous theories on addiction to psychoactive substances, from biological through socio-cultural to psychological ones. Psychological causes of addiction to psychoactive substances include the cognitive-behavioral theory, the psychodynamic interpretation of addiction, various stressful life events, traumas from early childhood and adolescence, as well as the influence of the family, peers, and the environment on the addict. Although the psychological aspects of addiction are a very important part of a later emergence of addiction to psychoactive substances, by shaping the personality of the addict, very little attention is paid to them in the treatment process. The aim of this work is to briefly consider each of the theories of psychoactive substance dependence, with a particular focus on the psychological aspects, their prevention, and treatment potential. In the end, three recent researches dealing with issues of family influence, stressful life events, and personality traits on later abuse of psychoactive substances are presented.",

These may be obvious, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions, or they may be subtle, appearing as changes in personality or motivation. 2 The three most common categories of neuropsychiatric posttransplant complications include the following: (1) concurrent pathological processes, such as mass lesion; (2) effects of vasoconstriction secondary to immunosuppressive medications; and (3) central nervous system pharmacodynamic effects of the immunosuppressive medications. 3 This differential diagnosis should guide the history as well as the mental status and neurological examinations. Suspected acute processes deserve computed tomography scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging, more sensitive to subtle structural change, should be generally reserved for cases suggesting such chronic change or those in which treatment appears ineffective. 4 Treatment follows the differential diagnosis. Concurrent diagnoses dictate specific treatment, such as in drainage of a subdural hematoma or administration of antibiotics for cerebral abscess. Symptoms referable to vasoconstriction suggest switching the primary immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms suggesting delirium indicate lowering the dosage of immunosuppressive medication, as in the case of generalized seizure, or use of very low-dose antipsychotic medication, as in cases of confusion, amotivational states, or personality changes.",

Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

Deterioration may also be due to an adverse effect of the radiation on nervous tissue or vessels within the beam, to alteration in the blood-brain barrier, thus influencing the effects of drug therapy, or to a superimposed catastrophe unrelated to the treatment. Transient effects, which occur within the first 3 months of radiotherapy, include increase in symptoms suggesting enlargement of the tumor and the somnolence syndrome that occurs in children. Classical permanent radiation effects include necrosis, atrophy, calcification, necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, mineralizing microangiopathy, aneurysm formation, tumor induction, and cerebrospinal fluid fistulae. Rarely, demyelination occurs with higher doses than are currently used. The permanent effects tend to occur later than the transient ones; some are progressive and many have serious consequences. The appearances of mineralizing microangiopathy are specific; but the nature of the other complications is only evident in the clinical context, although there may be difficulty distinguishing between radiation necrosis and further growth of an intracerebral tumor. Selected cases illustrate the computed tomographic features of these entities.",

Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

Dentro de las adicciones comportamentales se incluyen ludopatía, Internet y nuevas tecnologías, adicción a la comida, las compras y/o el sexo entre otras1 . Se considera la impulsividad un predictor de la adicción2 , en la impulsividad existe urgencia motivada por un estado de tensión que conduce a la acción derivada del estrés o ansiedad y la acción conduce a la relajación3 denominada compulsión, y podría constituir un eslabón en la cadena del desarrollo del comportamiento adictivo4 . Por ello un programa de intervención de enfermería para trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC) y adicciones comportamentales podría ser útil para el tratamiento de ambas patologías5 . Objetivos: ❖ Aumentar la motivación al cambio y eficacia percibida en relación a conductas de riesgo. ❖ Reducir sintomatología clínica y mantener resultados en el tiempo. ❖ Ampliar recursos personales y familiares para mejorar funcionamiento psico-socio- laboral de la persona. Material y métodos: Se realizará una evaluación pre-tratamiento, una monitorización del tratamiento, evaluación post-tratamiento inicial y a los 6 meses6 . El tratamiento consistirá en una intervención enfermera de salud mental dividida en módulos: A. Conceptos básicos sobre adicción B. Asertividad y respuesta social. Habilidades sociales. C. Gestión de la ansiedad: relajación y mindfulness D. Educación para la salud: higiene, alimentación y descanso. E. Psicoeducación familiar.

Case Summary: A 29-year-old white man and a 29-year-old white woman developed apathy, hypoactivity, blunted affect, depressed mood, and other depressive symptoms while taking olanzapine. Both showed a distinctly abnormal appearance. Clinicians attributed these symptoms to psychiatric illness, but the symptoms disappeared rapidly after drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Discussion: The only previous report of depression from olanzapine involved a medication interaction with fluoxetine. Another report described olanzapine-induced orbital-frontal syndrome, with childlike oversimplicity. If such symptoms are observed, the discontinuation of olanzapine is recommended. Conclusions: These observations suggest additional cautions when olanzapine is used outside of schizophrenia.",

If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics.

      "abstract": "Seizures in children can have greatly differing prognosis and treatment, depending on the type of seizure, age at onset, and family and medical history. Treatment can vary from none at all (eg, in the child with a single febrile seizure) to the use of more than one drug and the ketogenic diet (eg, in poorly controlled atypical absence, atonic, and some myoclonic disorders). When drug therapy is required, an appropriate agent is started and the dosage increased as needed to control seizures. If seizures persist or toxicity occurs, another drug should be substituted. When the patient has been seizure-free for a year, the drug can be slowly decreased and eventually discontinued. Any recurrence is most likely to occur within the first year after anticonvulsive medication is stopped.",

      "title": "Stress and cognition",
      "abstract": "Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are the most commonly prescribed anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant medications worldwide. This article highlights the risk of clinically significant and sometimes severe psychological, cognitive, and behavioral disturbances that may be associated with glucocorticoid use, as well as ways to prevent and treat these disturbances. An illustrative case vignette is presented describing a patient’s experience of cycles of manic-like behavior and depression while on high-dosage prednisone, with long-term cognitive disorganization, vulnerability to stress, and personality changes. Severe neuropsychiatric consequences (including suicide, suicide attempt, psychosis, mania, depression, panic disorder, and delirium, confusion, or disorientation) have been reported to occur in 15.7 per 100 person-years at risk for all glucocorticoid courses, and 22.2 per 100 person-years at risk for first courses. The majority of patients experience less severe but distressing and possibly persistent changes in mood, cognition, memory, or behavior during glucocorticoid treatment or withdrawal. Although prediction of such effects is difficult, risks vary with age, gender, dosage, prior psychiatric history, and several biological markers. Key mechanisms thought to underlie these risk factors are briefly described. Recommendations are given for identifying individual risk factors and for monitoring and managing adverse neuropsychiatric effects of glucocorticoids.",

We report two cases of neurologic complications requiring hospitalization in patients when atomoxetine was added to other psychoactive drugs. A 9-year-old taking clonidine and dextroamphetamine developed psychosis, abnormal involuntary movements, and insomnia. An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

      "abstract": "Editor—Sanfilippo syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) encompasses a group of four lysosomal storage disorders resulting from a failure to break down the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate. Each of the four subtypes, A, B, C, and D, is caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme in the degradative pathway of heparan sulphate: heparan-N-sulphatase (EC 3.10.1.1), α-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EC3.2.1.50), acetyl-CoA N-acetyl transferase (EC 2.3.1.3), and N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulphatase (EC 3.1.6.14), respectively.1 Clinical symptoms usually occur after two years of apparently normal development and include hyperactivity, aggressive behaviour, delayed development (particularly in speech), sleep disturbances, coarse hair, hirsutism, and diarrhoea. There are only relatively mild somatic manifestations. There then follows a period of progressive mental retardation with death usually between the second and third decade of life. In a small number of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, there is a more slowly progressive form of the disease with later onset known as the attenuated phenotype.2-4 A late onset phenotype has also been described for Sanfilippo syndrome type A.5 \n\nSanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme heparan-N-sulphatase (sulphamidase). The disease is autosomal recessive and the gene encoding the enzyme is situated on chromosome 17q25.3, contains eight exons, and encodes a protein of 502 amino acids.6 7 To date, 46 different mutations have been identified in Sanfilippo A patients,6 8-13 several of which have been found at high frequencies in particular populations.

      "abstract": "Unexplained physical signs and symptoms represent a significant portion of patient presentations in acute care settings. Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

      "title": "Symptomkontrolle am Lebensende",
      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

      "title": "The Role of Perfluorocarbons in Mitigating Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Neurological injury [brain and cord] is always accompanied by tissue deprivation of glucose and oxygen (ischemia/hypoxia). Most of the damage seems to be mediated by mechanisms that follow the initial injury (secondary mechanisms). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are one of the methods by which oxygen delivery to tissue can be achieved after injury. The rationale for PFCs in traumatic brain injury has been well established in animal studies and early phase 2 clinical trials. Currently three perfluorocarbons are available in the United States for testing, but none of these have been FDA approved and only for one of them Oxycyte has the process of application for FDA approval even been commenced. For the third generation perfluorocarbon (Oxycyte) a possible side effect that has emerged in humans is transient mild thrombocytopenia. It is uncertain at this time whether this side effect will prove to be a limiting factor, which may jeopardize the use of these compounds as a class, or just affect Oxycyte in particular following traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. Any agent that might exacerbate thrombocytopenia in intracranial hemorrhage into traumatic contusions is dangerous for obvious reasons. The purpose of this grant therefore is to cross compare the safety and efficacy of three perfluorocarbons namely Oxycyte, Perftec and Oxygent. We assessed these 3 PFC agents in two head injury models (1) new PENETRATING brain injury animal model (human gunshot wound to head) and (2) closed severe rat TBI Fluid Percussion Injury (human car crash) with a secondary Hypoxic insult. We measured how the PFCs alter the ability of the injured brain (1) to use glucose, oxygen and (2) lower cell death caused by injury, (3) effect on blood clotting. First, we did not find any evidence of impairment of blood clotting in rats with TBI after treatment with PFCs unlike in humans.",

      "title": "Therapeutic effectiveness and patient acceptance of a vestibular nerve activation intervention in chronic insomnia",
      "abstract": "Defined as: “Complaints of disturbed sleep in the presence of adequate opportunity and circumstance for sleep”, insomnia is one of the most common presenting symptoms in the primary care setting [1, 2]. The disturbance may consist of one or more of three features:• difficulty in initiating sleep• difficulty in maintaining sleep• waking up too early [3].Insomnia can have a serious impact on work performance and maintaining healthy social relationships [4]. Chronic insomnia is differentiated from acute insomnia by individuals experiencing at least one of the symptoms described above for a minimum of 30 days [3]. Predictably, there has been a wealth of research in the areas of assessment and treatment for this sleep disorder, given the impact insomnia has been shown to have on mental and physical health and wellbeing [3-5]. Incidence rates are routinely around 9% of the general population, escalating to 30% for those who report occasional suffering [6]. Many individuals continue to report symptoms of insomnia for many years after initial onset [7]. Areas of particular interest to clinicians, health-care professionals and insomnia sufferers include implementation, acceptance and adherence to therapies that provide effective long-term management. Conventional treatments include prescription medications (sedative-hypnotics), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other alternative therapies (e.g. alcohol, herbal remedies and off-label use of other medicines) [3]. While sedative-hypnotics and CBT have been shown to be effective in the treatment of insomnia [3,8], expert opinion counsels against long-term use of sedative-hypnotics due to residual sedation, rebound insomnia, memory impairment, dependency and withdrawal difficulties [9, 10]. In addition, CBT is not easily accessed and patients frequently have difficulty adhering to the strict behavioral program that is typically prescribed [11]. A further area of concern is the limited evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alternative therapies, despite their widespread use [3].One promising approach to managing chronic insomnia is non-invasive mechanical vestibular nerve stimulation, which has been demonstrated to affect sleep [12-17]. The vestibular apparatus, in conjunction with visual and proprioceptive inputs, is responsible for maintaining balance under all conditions. Previous studies have used a mechanical rocking motion to induce vestibular activation, mimicking the sensation of infants being comforted by their parents. Improvements in sleep architecture and increased Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, Rapid Eye Movement and decreased Sleep Onset Latency have been demonstrated when using this technique [12-17]. A unique therapy, designed to non-invasively stimulate the vestibular nerve to promote sleep onset, has recently been developed. As an alternative to the rocking motion delivered by mechanical action, a swaying sensation is artificially created through mild electrical stimulation. Clinical studies have been previously conducted to investigate both the safety and efficacy of this medical device for the treatment of insomnia via a transient insomnia model, with positive outcomes [18, 19]. Individuals with chronic insomnia report similar issues in sleep disturbance to those in transient insomnia, but persistent in nature. Given the limitations of current effective therapies, and the recent emphasis on patient-centered care [20], there is an increasing need for an alternative treatment for insomnia symptoms. It has been shown that patient preference for non-pharmacological treatment was over three times greater than prescription medications [21]. Thus many would prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach if an effective one were available [11]. Vestibular nerve activation may provide such a treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic activity at central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral serotonin receptors [1]. for this reason, some experts strongly prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome because these more accurately reflect the fact that it is a form of poisoning. It may also be called serotonin sickness, serotonin storm, serotonin poisoning, hyperserotonemia, or serotonergic syndrome [2, 3]. The excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including cognitive, autonomic, and somatic effects. The symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal. [1]Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the patient’s history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illnesses in some patients, particularly those with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. No laboratory tests can currently confirm the diagnosis [3].",

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses. Detailed neurological evaluation needs to be undertaken in such cases. Timely recognition of PBA is essential for an effective treatment.

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

The latter include improved psychophysiological control as well as enhanced performance in controlled parapsychological experiments. Multiple studies on meditation, hypnosis, sensory homogenization, psychoactive drug ingestion, and spontaneous alterations of consciousness have demonstrated enhanced physiological (e.g., gastrointestinal and other somatic systems, heart rate and bleeding control, ability to withstand cold temperature and painful stimuli) and psychological (e.g., perceptual sensitivity, attention control and cognitive deautomatization, creativity, enhanced positive affect and personality change) functioning. Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time. Recommendations for further development of research in this area are provided. (Less)",

      "abstract": "Five cases of dependence on popular analgesics containing barbiturates as the active ingredient have been presented. In all of these cases the patient developed the habit of using the drugs in the second or third decade of life in order to accomplish relief from headache. A rapid increase in tolerance took place in a few months, with most of the patients eventually requiring several times the usual dose. Symptoms of chronic intoxication were often milder than those with other habituating drugs. No antisocial acts as a result of the abuse were observed. Headaches as a manifestation of chronic intoxication may be considered to have played a role in establishing analgesic dependence. The abstinence syndrome developed a few hours after withdrawal: a generalized convulsion occurred first, followed by various disturbances of consciousness and then by a hallucinatory-delusional state. These symptoms cleared up in three days to a week, while a corresponding course was followed by the EEG findings. Withdrawal symptoms didn't appear at the time when allopyrabital as the active ingredient of popular analgesic preparations was replaced with cyclopyrabital but did appear in four cases at the very time when bromvalerylurea was substituted as the active principle of these preparations. Even at that time such a syndrome was not manifested in one case, suggesting the possibility of a cross-reaction of allobarbital and cyclo-barbital and of barbiturate and bromvalerylurea.",

      "title": "The effectiveness of preferred or familiar music listening on behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with dementia: a systematic review",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective Is preferred or familiar music listening effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms of institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia? For institutionalised older adults with all types of dementia what is the evidence about the: Frequency of use of preferred or familiar music listening; Length of preferred or familiar music listening per session. Background Dementia is a severe public health problem affecting over 35 million people worldwide1. Dementia is a syndrome of cognitive deterioration which may result in changes in personality and interfere with activities of daily living and social functions2. According to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold model (PLST), older adults with cognitive impairment caused by wide range of psychological reactions, psychiatric symptoms, and behaviors which may be disruptive, unsafe and impair the care of patients with dementia in a given environment4. Specific symptoms may include apathy, agitation, aggression, depression, anxiety, wandering, psychotic symptoms and others5. Of those diagnosed with dementia, more than two-thirds experience BPSD6. BPSD may cause significant impairment of social or occupational functioning in those with dementia2 and place tremendous burden on family caregivers and nursing staff in the care of those with dementia as well as a strain on health care resources7. BPSD in older people with dementia are typically managed with the use of psychotropic medications, but these treatments present risks for adverse effects8. Use of psychotropic medications in those with dementia has to be cautious due to the unwanted side effects9, and a further study concludes that the adverse effects of antipsychotics, including an increased risk of stroke and death, offset its potential advantages10. Given the concerns associated with the use of antipsychotic medications for BPSD, a wide range of non-pharmacological strategies have been suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms. One approach is modifying environmental factors that place too much demand or pressures on the individual and this has been suggested as one of the most effective interventions in reducing behavioural problems of those with dementia in residential care facilities11. Introducing a sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximising familiarity in an existing environment can enhance the functional abilities of those with dementia12, 13. Using aspects of prior familiar environments can modify unpleasant and external stimuli in the environment and prevent anxiety in those with dementia14. One other non-pharmacological care approach which has been frequently suggested to manage behavioural and psychological symptoms is use of music15. Music has been shown to positively influence a broad range of outcomes including alleviating anxiety, promoting relaxation, improving mood, reducing pain, decreasing agitation, improving exercise performance, and increasing food intake among various populations16. Listening to preferred music in particular has been suggested to effectively manage agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia15, 17-19. Familiar music from the past can assist in memory recall and elicit memories associated with positive feelings15. Researchers indicate that the areas of the brain that respond to music are the last to deteriorate in dementia and suggested that music may be one form of communication that remains preserved in people with dementia who respond to music20. Older people are usually fond of music that was popular during their youth21. Music from religious services, patriotic ceremonies or cultural events would have specific meaning to the person's life15. Music that elicits positive memories from the past can have a soothing effect, and these positive feelings, in turn, will prevent or reduce agitation in people who are aged 65 or above with dementia15, 21. Listening to familiar or preferred music can enhance the sense of familiarity into a new environment or maximise familiarity in an existing environment for those with dementia to stimulate their memories associated with pleasant feelings and thereby induce relaxation22 and reduce anxiety23 and enhance their functional abilities12, 13. music is proposed to be accessible, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use with those with dementia28, 29. Several reviews have focused on the use of music for older people with dementia and found beneficial effects on their behaviours and social interaction30-34. Some reviews on music and dementia research included different types of music activities and various outcomes. For example, Vink et al33 reviewed randomised controlled trials related to effects of music therapy on behavioural problems, social, cognition, and emotion, and concluded that there is no substantial evidence to support nor discourage the use of music therapy in the care of older people with dementia. In Sheratt et al's review34, they included different types of music therapy, such as group music activities or individual or group listening to all types of music, and concluded that music have the potential to reduce problematic behaviours and provide engagement in meaningful activity. However, these reviews limited the generalisability of findings as they failed to differentiate which type of music activities worked for which outcomes in older adults with dementia. Sung and Chang29 conducted a review of eight studies which specifically focused on preferred music on agitated behaviours of older adults with dementia and reported that the evidence was inconclusive due to small sample sizes and variations in the application of the preferred music intervention across the studies. In addition, previous reviews only included studies written in English and published in English journals, and did not include studies which were published in other languages. This review will focus on studies determining the effects of preferred or familiar music listening or comparisons of preferred or familiar music listening with other types of interventions for managing behavioural and psychological symptoms in older adults with dementia, and will include published studies written in English or Chinese. This review will be a joint review conducted by the Queensland Centre for Evidence Based Nursing & Midwifery and the Taiwanese Centre for Evidence-based Health Care. One reviewer from each centre, who is competent in reading, writing, and speaking both in English and Chinese, will conduct the searching, relevance checking and quality appraisal of the studies written in English or Chinese. Inclusion criteria Types of participants This review will consider studies that include adults aged 65 or older and diagnosed with all types of dementia who exhibit behavioural or psychological symptoms living in long-term care institutions. Behavioural or psychological symptoms to be included: agitation; aggressive behaviours; aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety; depression. Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interest This review will consider studies that evaluated preferred or familiar music listening interventions for the prevention or reduction of behavioural or psychological symptoms of older adults with dementia. This review will consider studies that include the following outcome measures: behavioral and psychological symptoms, agitation, agitated behaviours, aggressive behaviours, aggression, disruptive behaviours, anxiety, or depression. Types of studies This review will consider any randomised controlled trials (RCT); In the absence of RCT's, other research designs such as non-randomized controlled trials and before and after studies will be considered for inclusion. In addition to excluding studies that were not reported in English or Chinese, this review will exclude studies with patients receiving music listening without considering music preferences and familiarity. Observational, cohort, case-control, and qualitative studies will be excluded. Search strategy The search strategy aims to find published studies in peer review journals written in English and Chinese from 1990-2010. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in each component of this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe article. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms will then be undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles will be searched for additional studies. Additional hand search in music journals will also be conducted. The databases to be searched include:PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsyInfo, PsychArticles, Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Music Index (via EBSCOhost) as well as Chinese publication databases. The Chinese databases will include: (1) http://www.ceps.com.tw (2) http://www.cetd.com.tw (3) http://www.ncl.edu.tw/journal/journal_docu01.htm Initial keywords to be used will be‘preferred music’, ‘individualized music’, ‘familiar music’, ‘behavioural and psychological symptoms’, ‘agitated behaviours’, ‘agress*’, ‘agitat*’, ‘anxiety’, ‘depress*’, ‘dementia’, ‘Alzheimer's disease’, ‘preferred music and dementia’, ‘preferred music and Alzheimer's disease’, ‘familiar music and dementia’ and ‘familiar music and Alzheimer's disease’. Assessment of methodological quality Quantitative papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardised critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix I). Any disagreements that arise between the reviewers will be resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer. the review question and specific objectives. Data synthesis Quantitative results will, where possible be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). All results will be subject to double data entry. Odds ratio (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling is not possible the findings will be presented in narrative form. None",

      "title": "[Depression: longer-lasting episode not an automatic indication for referral].",
      "abstract": "During episodes of depression, patients exhibit a low mood and a number of other emotional and/or physical symptoms for a certain period of time. Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

Such a picture may be present in the severely burned individual, in the victim of a perforating ulcer, in the mangled railroad man, or in sepsis. Aside from these specific instances, we rarely see every symptom of the syndrome so exaggerated. In a broader sense we may still have shock, although some, or all, of the symptoms are mitigated or almost abated. For instance, during laparotomy the intestines in early shock lose their normal tone before blood pressure begins to fall. Persistent trauma may bring out the picture. It may be going too far to say that we may have shock without any symptoms, but it is very difficult often to tell when we get our first symptoms. To",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "title": "Suvremeno liječenje paničnog poremećaja",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

      "abstract": "Anticholinergic poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the emergency department. Beautiful hawthorn (atropa belladonna), which is found in our country, is one of the plants that can cause anticholinergic syndrome. It is important in the differential diagnosis in cases progressing with general status disorder and loss of consciousness and psychotic findings. The onset of anticholinergic intoxication varies depending on the toxin and occurs within one to two hours following oral ingestion. The diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning is based on clinical findings. Anticholinergic poisoning is easily diagnosed when a history of exposure to an anticholinergic substance is obtained and the patient shows altered mental status, delirium or hallucinations. However, in cases with no history and unknown exposure, the diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication is considered when clinical signs and symptoms caused by mental status disorder and anticholinergic effects are detected on physical examination. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of slurred speech, altered consciousness and facial shifting that started about 2 hours ago. On physical examination, the patient was incoopere and disoriented, GCS:12 eyes were spontaneously open, obeying orders but making unintelligible sounds, nuchal rigidity was suspiciously positive, bilateral babinski reflex was positive. On admission vital signs were blood pressure 144/72 mmHg, pulse 98/min, temperature 37 °C, SO2 94%, fingerstick blood glucose 104 mg/dl and ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. There were no acute pathologic findings on both brain CT and brain MR imaging. In the control physical examination, both pupils were mydriatic, IR -/- and the patient had dry mouth. According to the anamnesis obtained from another relative of the patient, it was learned that they ate spinach in the evening and speech disorder started afterwards. The patient was diagnosed with anticholinergic intoxication considering that the spinach eaten by the patient with clinical findings might have been mixed with the beautiful hawthorn weed. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the importance of detailing the anamnesis and the necessity of a complete systemic examination in patients presenting with confusion and speech disorder.",

We report the case of a heavy smoker admitted because of a reagudization of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. At the third day of nicotine abstinence, he developed delirium with a rapid improvement of his symptoms after treatment with a transdermal nicotine patch. This description suggests that in hospitalized heavy smokers who develop delirium with agitation, a simple trial with a nicotine patch can offer a dramatic therapeutic response in a few hours, constituting additionally a confirmatory test.

      "abstract": "Individuals suffering from mental illnesses, unfortunately, have a shorter lifespan. An increase in mortality rates is primarily due to physical illness, unhealthy lifestyle, and associated comorbidities. Antipsychotic medications, previously known as tranquilizers, antipsychotics, or neuroleptics, can alleviate or attenuate symptoms related to psychosis, delusion, and/or hallucinations and are used in the treatment of psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or Alzheimer's disease. Within hours to days, these medications alleviate symptoms and reduce confusion in individuals with psychosis; however, the full effect may take longer than usual in some cases. Importantly, these drugs do not cure the disease, but only treat the symptoms of the disease. The treatment is adjusted to reduce any psychotic symptoms while keeping the adverse effects to a minimum level. Antipsychotics may lead to increased risk of diseases, including but not limited to, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, renal, or respiratory disorders. Improved dosages, polypharmacy, and age-specific treatment play an important role in limiting the comorbidities, as well as the side effects. Further research and clinical attention are required to understand the functioning of these medications. The review focuses on the use of antipsychotic medications in different diseases and their effect on mental health.",

Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

      "title": "Confusional status epilepticus in elderly",
      "abstract": "Non-convulsive confusional status epilepticus (NCSE) is clinically characterized by prolonged impairment of consciousness of variable entity, often associated with myoclonias or automatisms. EEG shows continuous paroxysmal activity or electrographic discharges. When NCSE occurs in older patients, differential diagnosis with other conditions such as stroke or toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, may be difficult and a high degree of suspicion is required. Emergency EEG represents the most important means of investigation in such cases. According to ictal EEG, NCSE may be classified as generalized (including typical and “de novo” absence status) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Absence status, or ‘petit mal’ status, is the most frequently encountered form of NCSE. It can occur in the context of different types of generalized idiopathic epilepsies, or ‘de novo’, with onset usually in the elderly, precipitated by toxic or metabolic factors in subjects with no previous history of epilepsy [1]. Ictal EEG shows continuous or almost continuous generalized spike and polyspike and wave discharges. Clinical and EEG normalization occurs after i.v. benzodiazepines (BDZ) in most cases. The prognosis of “de novo” absence status is generally good and recurrences are rare [1]. In CPSE, impairment of consciousness may be continuous or fluctuating, but it is usually clinically very difficult to distinguish from absence status. CPSE may occur in patients with preexisting epilepsy, at times precipitated by AEDs withdrawal, or in subjects with acute or remote cerebral lesions. Ictal EEG shows continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. CPSE tends to recur and may be difficult to treat (response to i.v. BDZ in ~ 60% of patients) [2]. Cognitive and behavioral sequelae have been rarely reported, thus prompting an early recognition and treatment of such a condition. Mortality is also rare, mostly depending on etiology, but may reach up to 26,3% in the elderly. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, the symptoms are unusual, and the patients should be documented extensively [3].",

      "title": "Tolerance and withdrawal symptoms may not be helpful to enhance understanding of behavioural addictions",
      "abstract": "The importance attached to tolerance and withdrawal symptoms in the conceptualization of addiction reflects the prominence of theories that posit neuroadaptation to the presence of a drug [1], and suggest that drug use persists because of negative reinforcement, i.e. as an effort to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms [2]. Given that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms do not always occur in addiction, they have not been included in the recent general definitions of addiction [3–5]. However, these phenomena are often incorporated into the conceptualization of behavioural addictions. For example, one model [6] postulates that tolerance and withdrawal symptoms are mandatory for any behaviour to be considered addictive. In behavioural addictions, tolerance is usually defined in a way that superficially resembles its counterpart in substance addictions, i.e. dose escalation to achieve the same initial effect. Thus, tolerance is portrayed as an increase in various aspects of the activity (frequency, intensity, duration, time spent, money spent) to achieve the desired effect, satisfaction or excitement. Occasionally, it is described as a need for the latest or more powerful equipment (e.g. mobile phones, computers, software) to produce the desired effect or excitement [7,8]. The diagnostic criteria for internet gaming disorder [9] do not state the purpose of an increase in activity engagement, implying that any such increase denotes tolerance. Nevertheless, increased activity engagement and a need for better equipment in behavioural addictions do not necessarily reflect tolerance [10,11], which underscores the importance of assessing the contextual aspects of these phenomena. Withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions have usually been described as emotional states (irritability, restlessness, anger, moodiness, sadness, guilt, anxiety, feeling tense) that occur when activity engagement is thwarted. In internet gaming disorder, withdrawal symptoms can be easily mistaken for reactions to an externally imposed gaming deprivation or for craving for gaming [12]. There have been no reports of severe physical withdrawal symptoms in behavioural addictions [13], and a few studies reporting physical withdrawal symptoms in pathological gambling [14,15] had significant methodological shortcomings. Withdrawal states occurring upon abrupt drug cessation comprise both physical and emotional symptoms, with the latter hypothesized to contribute more to the motivation to continue using drugs because of the short-lasting effects of the former [2]. In pathological gambling, however, emotional withdrawal symptoms, as well as tolerance, were not found to play an important role in maintaining this behavioural addiction [16]. ‘Borrowing’ tolerance and withdrawal from substance addictions might have been driven by a need to ‘legitimize’ behavioural addictions. This was unnecessary, because these phenomena and theories suggesting that they are important for addiction have not been able to account fully for either type of addiction [5]. The alternative is to conceptualize behavioural addictions via specific factors that explain more clearly attachment to the particular activity [17] and maintenance of addictive behaviour. In pathological gambling, these factors were identified as the negative feelings associated with gambling losses, shortage of money and the need to be secretive about gambling [16]. The task is to ascertain factors that provide an adequate account for each behavioural addiction. None.",

      "title": "The Religious Sentiment in Epileptics",
      "abstract": "In the following observations I propose to describe a feature in the mental condition of Epileptics, which, to the best of my knowledge, has not attracted that attention to which its frequency entitles it. I refer to the exaltation of the religious sentiment. Irritability, suspicion, impulsive violence, egotism, strong homicidal propensities are among the most commonly observed characteristics in the insane epileptic; but in strange contradiction with these we very frequently find combined a strong devotional feeling, manifesting itself, it may be, in simple piety or in decided religious delusions. I do not pretend that the forms of religious insanity to be afterwards noticed are peculiar to epilepsy, but they are very frequently found in connection with it, and, I believe, I have only to describe a few illustrative cases to bring to your recollection numerous others which have occurred in your own experience. The causes which combine to develope a devotional frame of mind in Epileptics are probably numerous. In congenital cases or those arising from diseases of childhood education no doubt exercises a powerful influence. The epileptic child is necessarily less able to join in the amusements and occupations of healthy children, and a large share of his time and attention may be devoted at home to religious instruction. The mysterious nature of the disease, the consciousness of infirmity and helplessness developes a craving for sympathy in the epileptic which we rarely see in other lunatics. In the wards and airing-courts of our asylums, epileptics may be distinguished from their fellow-patients by the fact that they are generally found associating in little groups of twos or threes. They sympathize with each other, lean on each other for help in the time of trouble, and however much they exhibit violence and viciousness to others, they rarely attack each other. Along with this desire for sympathy, the epileptic is mercifully endowed with strong hope. He is always getting over his trouble, he thinks the turns are less severe, and will tell you perhaps the day before a fatal seizure that he thinks he will have no more fits. We all know how much hope has helped the physician in his efforts to combat this disease with a whole battery of drugs, each of which in its turn seems for a time to promise success, only too surely to fail in the end. This craving for sympathy finds a deep response in the highest development of hope—religion; and the sufferings of this life are assuaged by the assurance of sympathy and aid from heaven, and of a blessed future where suffering and sorrow are no more.",

Most often, intermittent forms of alcohol abuse or dependence are observed in patients who present, between the acute ingestions of alcohol, a chronic consumption. Intermittent ingestions of alcohol can also be present among subjects presenting a pathological personality (antisocial personality) and a past or present dependence syndrome to heroine.

The diagnostic criteria for mania require the presence of distinct periods of abnormal mood characterized by euphoria, expansiveness, or irritability. The change in mood is accompanied by increased activity or energy as well as other symptoms such as grandiosity, decreased sleep, increased speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, agitation, and increased involvement in risky behaviors. The assessment of bipolar disorder should include a detailed psychiatric history ascertaining the presence of current or previous mood symptoms. Children and adolescents are more likely to present with either rapidly fluctuating or a mixed mood state. Bipolar disorder is associated with high relapse rates, even among those receiving treatment. The first-line medication class is second-generation antipsychotics.

Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions.

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory).

Conversely, a majority of patients with Cushing's syndrome of any cause report neuropsychiatric symptoms, most often changes in mood and cognition. Only the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Cushing's disease have been well documented; they differ from those of major depression in important ways. In Cushing's disease, the depression, if present, is intermittent rather than sustained, and there is weight gain (rather than weight loss), more irritability, and less psychomotor retardation, withdrawal, and hopelessness. Depression, irritability, and loss of libido often occur early in Cushing's disease, sometimes even before patients are aware that they have physical symptoms other than weight gain. The quality of the neuropsychiatric symptoms and their early occurrence in Cushing's disease argue against a nonspecific response (e.g., demoralization) to severe physical illness. After the Cushing's disease is cured, the neuropsychiatric symptoms usually abate, but their resolution does not always parallel the resolution of endocrine symptoms. The pathophysiology of the hypercortisolemia in depression and Cushing's disease seem to reflect abnormalities in different loci (e.g., at or above the hypothalamus in depression and at the pituitary in Cushing's disease).",

      "abstract": "The life settings in which sudden death may occur can be classified into eight categories: [1] on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person; [2] during acute grief; [3] on threat of loss of a close person; [4] during mourning or on an anniversary; [5] on loss of status or self-esteem; [6] personal danger or threat of injury; [7] after the danger is over; [8] reunion, triumph, or happy ending. Common to all is that they involve events impossible for the victims to ignore and to which their response is overwhelming excitation or giving up, or both. It is proposed that this combination provokes neurovegetative responses, involving both the flight-fight and conservation-withdrawal systems, conducive to lethal cardiac events, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease; other modes of death, however, were also noted. Better understanding of the potentially lethal life situations and identification of individuals at risk may lead to the development of practical prophylactic measures.",

Often these patients say they become ill when exposed to various odors, often in response to cacosmia (Ryan et al., 1988) or dysosmia (Miller, 1996). For example, they may describe everyday exposures to fragrances, diesel exhaust, new plastic car interiors, household cleaners, etc. (Table 1), as being overpowering, \"stronger than ever before,\" or \"extremely irritating\" and triggering symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, memory difficulties, mental confusion, anxiety, irritability, depression, myalgias, arrhythmias, dyspnea, and every sort of gastrointestinal problem (Table 2). This clinical presentation has come to be known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or multiple chemical intolerance. Patients presenting with this peculiar combination of subjective hyperosmia, multisystem symptoms, and multiple intolerances appear to be on the increase (AOEC, 1992; NIEHS, 1997; NRC, 1992).

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "A minority of headache patients have a secondary headache disorder. The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "abstract": "High-intensity and/or prolonged exposure to noise causes temporary or permanent threshold shifts in auditory perception. Occupational exposure to solvents or administration of clinically important drugs, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin, also can induce permanent hearing loss. The mechanisms by which these ototoxic insults cause auditory dysfunction are still being unraveled, yet they share common sequelae, particularly generation of reactive oxygen species, that ultimately lead to hearing loss and deafness. Individuals are frequently exposed to ototoxic chemical contaminants (e.g., fuel) and noise simultaneously in a variety of work and recreational environments. Does simultaneous exposure to chemical ototoxins and noise potentiate auditory dysfunction? Exposure to solvent vapor in noisy environments potentiates the permanent threshold shifts induced by noise alone. Moderate noise levels potentiate both aminoglycoside- and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in both rate of onset and in severity of auditory dysfunction. Thus, simultaneous exposure to chemical ototoxins and moderate levels of noise can potentiate auditory dysfunction. Preventing the ototoxic synergy of noise and chemical ototoxins requires removing exposure to ototoxins and/or attenuating noise exposure levels when chemical ototoxins are present.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced paranoid hallucinatory psychosis (i.e., flashbacks) occasionally occurs in response to non-specific mild stress in drug-free patients with a history of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced psychosis. Stress sensitization associated with noradrenergic hyperactivity and increased dopamine release may be related to this flashbacks. Stressful frightening experiences as well as fear-related paranoid- hallucinatory states during methamphetamine use may be related to these stress sensitization. Robust noradrenergic hyperactivity with increased dopamine release may predicts subsequent flashback episodes. Schizophrenia-like symptoms (e.g., passivity phenomena, Gedankenlautwerden, and thought disorder such as circumstantiality and egorrhea symptoms) appear to develop related to dopaminergic hyperactivity. One of the dopamine receptor-encoding genes DRD2, TaqIA A1/A1 type, with which reduced density of the D2 receptor is associated, reduces to the risk of development of flashbacks. Stress sensitization has been proposed as a key step in the progression from vulnerability to an overt paranoidhallucinatory states, so that schizophrenia and flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis shares common underlying mechanisms of stress sensitization. Compared to flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis, psychedelic drug flashbacks are the recurrence of a perception learned while an individual is experiencing high anxiety levels, and thus recur in anxiety-related situations. Anxiety or fear during drug use is an important factor in the development of flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis and also psychedelic drug flashbacks. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neural circuits including the striatum, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex play an important role in the development of psychostimulant-induced long-lasting behavioral sensitization. Immediate early genes expression in the particular brain regions affected by the psychostimulants is involved in this process. Furthermore, recent advances in molecular analysis could shed light on the fundamental mechanism involved, by identifying specific participating molecules such as delta FosB, NAC1, G-protein b1 subunit and methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1b.

They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses. The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine. alpha-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment. Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear.

Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol shows a high affinity by nervous system, and that explains the behaviour-altering effects of drinking. Te nervous system affinity of alcohol is due to biochemical and metabolic characteristics of this substance: 1) Alcohol is rapidly and homogeneously distributed by body tissues and fluids, penetrating through body barriers, including the hematoencephalic one. 2) Because of its great liposolubility, it interacts with lipoid component in neuronal membrane causing long-term changes in neuronal conductance, and long-term structural changes. Behaviour disturbances in alcohol-abusing persons are related with: 1) Alcohol acute effects on neuronal membrane and synapses consisting in transitional disturbances on membrane potential and neurotransmission function. 2) Alcohol long-term effect causing by brain adjustment in synaptic transmission. 3) The relative irreversible disturbances induced by structural synaptic damage. 4) Other conditions related with alcohol abuse but not directly causing by it, such as nutritional deficiencies, and pathologic conditions seen in chronic alcoholism. In clinical practice we usually find disorders due to acute effects of ethanol on brain like different disorders related with alcohol intoxication; disorders due to tolerance development, such as withdrawal syndrome; and those chronic ad multicausal conditions with different degree of reversibility which are consequences of structural brain damage, like Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy, alcoholic neuropthaty, and alcohol induced dementia.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance dependence or dependence syndrome, is a condition where a person feels a strong need to take a drug. Addiction also involves other behaviors. These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect. We hope this book can demonstrate advances in drug addiction as well as give references to the researchers, students and other related people.",

A synthesis of physiological signs and symptoms demonstrated through various body organs as sources or contributing factors related to hypoxia or prolonged hypoxemia presented as a guide for evaluating oxygen need. There are many symptoms notable for oxygen deprivation and the symptoms may be subtle and occur over long periods of time or they may have a very acute or abrupt disruption of circulation or blood flow that is of immediate concern and life threatening.

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient.

Ultimately, it results in global hypoperfusion and a resulting increase in anaerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis. Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in the critical care setting is of primary importance in the management of a critically ill patient. When oxygen supply is inadequate, the body undergoes several physiological changes to maintain the oxygen delivery requirements and perfusion pressure. This stage is referred to as compensated shock, and early signs of shock may be appreciated during this stage. When compensatory mechanisms are inadequate and DO2 begins to fall beyond the critical point, shock has progressed to the uncompensated stage. During this stage, there is rapid deterioration of the patient due to prolonged hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is the development of potentially reversible physiological derangement involving two or more organ systems not involved in the causative disorder, which results in persisting states of shock, sepsis and hypoperfusion and a major cause of high mortality in the intensive care unit reaching a range of 11–54% in septic pediatric patients. The final stage of shock is irreversible shock, which is also referred to as refractory shock. This final stage of shock carries a 96–99% mortality rate.",

The most common conditions underlying catatonia are affective disorders followed by schizophrenia, but several medical conditions including intoxications affecting the central nervous system can also present with catatonic signs and symptoms. Therapeutic doses of disulfiram could induce catatonia with or without accompanying psychosis or mood disorder. A case of disulfiram intoxication manifesting with catatonia is reported here together with a brief overview of the literature. A patient was admitted to the toxicology ward after a suicide attempt with approximately 20 g of disulfiram. On transfer to the psychiatric ward, she was sitting still, in a semi-stuporous state and displayed motiveless resistance to instructions or attempts to move (active negativism). She was unresponsive to most of the questions (mutism), occasionally verbigerated 1-2 words and stared for more than 20 seconds between shifting attention. After developing a comatosus state her treatment continued at the toxicology ward, where a contrast-enhanced computer tomography scan revealed bilateral emollition of 1.5 cm diameter in both nucleus lentiformis at the level of the third ventricle. Following treatment her condition improved and she benefited of rehabilitation facility and a second psychiatric treatment. She was discharged free of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we underscore the importance of accurate diagnosis of the underlying psychiatric or medical condition when encountering a fast emerging catatonic syndrome and focus first on treating the causative condition while simultaneously attempting symptomatic treatment of catatonia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract My position statement on neglect is more of an agenda for further research than an attempt at explanation. I assume that neglect, caused, for example, by right parietal damage, results neither form simple sensory loss and nor from motor impairment. It also appears not to be a unitary disorder. Failures to orient towards salient stimuli, often labelled as “neglect”, can occur because of damage to other brain regions besides the parietal lobe, and in animals other than man. But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect). Sometimes these forms of neglect apparently occur together in the same individual, raising questions about the foci and extent of their brain lesions.",

Apart from factors not specifically related to pulmonary diseases (e.g. consequences of infections or malignant diseases of the lungs), increased work of breathing due to impaired lung/thoracic cage mechanics, the effects of chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, the consequences of disturbed sleep and psychosocial factors are mainly responsible for the impaired physical fitness and the fatigue in association with lung diseases. A careful case history including psychosocial aspects and a thorough physical examination are essential for an efficient diagnostic evaluation. Tests of pulmonary function not only in the awake patient at rest, but also during sleep or adequate physical exercise can reveal the causes of impaired physical performance and fatigue related to lung diseases.",

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome following introduction of venlafaxine following withdrawal of phenelzine: implications for drug washout periods",
      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "Patients with cancer typically experience multiple symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment. These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3). Undertreatment of symptoms has become a major health problem in its own right.",

Hyperarousal, or feeling on edge, irritability and exaggerated “startle” responses to stimuli, and emotional numbing (sufferers feeling cut off and detached) have also been described.\n\nPTSD in children was originally described after particularly traumatic events such as physical and sexual abuse1–3 and the witnessing of violence.4 It has been recognised following both natural5,6 and man-made7,8 disasters, and extensively documented in refugees,9,10 war situations11 and in response to terrorism-induced trauma.12\n\nMore recently, attention has focused on PTSD occurring as a consequence of a variety of paediatric conditions, some life threatening, including cancer,13 head injury14 and motor vehicle accidents15,16 as well as mild to moderate paediatric trauma,17 acute illnesses resulting in admission to paediatric intensive care units,18 children who undergo organ transplantation19 and after diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 1.20\n\nStressful experiences related to serious paediatric illness in children may be expected to affect parents psychologically. Accordingly, high levels of symptoms of PTSD have been reported in parents of children with a variety of problems such as meningococcal infections requiring admission to paediatric intensive care units,21 in family members of adolescent cancer survivors22 and of children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.23\n\nEarly identification and appropriate referral …",

The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen.

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "title": "The pathology of torture",
      "abstract": "Detainees may be subjected to torture and extra-judicial execution by State actors and terrorists. But, the pathology of torture has not been well-described. This is due to the lack of autopsies performed on victims of torture, mostly due to the disposal of the bodies of the victims by their torturers. On this basis, the cause of death of detainees subjected to torture is often a matter of speculation or remains obscure. This paper provides an overview of the pathology of torture based on the authour's experience with the autopsies of torture victims. At autopsy, many different types of inflicted injuries may be observed, often ranging in severity. However, three recurrent patterns of trauma that are the hallmarks of torture were recognized by the authour: (1) blunt impact trauma characterized by bruises, patterned injuries, and internal injuries; (2) electrical and thermal injuries; and (3) injuries from stress positions that occur from prolonged suspension. The most under-recognized form of fatal torture are the complications of stress positions related to suspension of the victim's body by the upper, or lower extremities. For example, prolonged suspension by reverse hanging (suspension of the victim's body by the wrists or forearms with the arms extended backward at the shoulder joint) can cause over-stretching and necrosis of the muscles of the shoulder, resulting in fatal myoglobinuric renal failure. It is essential that autopsies be performed on all detainees who die in custody, to determine if torture played a role in death. Furthermore, the true nature of the injuries sustained often remains obscure unless a musculocutaneous dissection is performed. Specifically, dissection of the back, limbs and the soles of the feet, as well as the shoulders and knees is essential to determine if specific forms of torture have been applied. This is especially true for fatal complications of stress positions. Seeking the truth about the medical consequences of fatal torture will raise awareness about torture-related injuries, assist in rehabilitation of torture survivors, and strengthen forensic humanitarian action.",

      "title": "The treatment of the first seizure: The risks",
      "abstract": "The risks associated with prescribing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in a person who had a single unprovoked seizure fall into three domains: (1) the risk that treatment will not be effective in preventing seizure relapse, and the consequences thereof; (2) the risks of a person's life being affected by the psychological, social, and legal aspects of receiving treatment for a seizure disorder; (3) the health risks associated with intake of antiepileptic medication. This article with focus on the latter, addressing in particular concerns related to adverse drug effects. Serious or life-threatening adverse reactions are very uncommon in people started on AEDs, although some (e.g., teratogenic effects) can be a major concern in specific patient groups. Nonserious adverse reactions leading to withdrawal of treatment are relatively common, although in most cases these are reversible following removal of the offending agent. Adverse effects associated with prolonged treatment and not leading to drug withdrawal are an important concern, because such effects are often under-recognized and may affect significantly quality of life. Additional risks relate to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. In all cases, risks can be minimized by careful selection of the AED to be used (with particular consideration of individual characteristics which contraindicate a specific AED, or predispose to specific adverse effects), gradual dose titration, choice of an appropriate target dose and, most important of all, careful monitoring of clinical response.",

      "title": "Amphetamine Use as a Risk Factor for Low-Dose Risperidone–Induced Acute Dystonia",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia is defined as sustained abnormal postures or muscle spasms that develop within 7 days of starting or rapidly raising the dose of an antipsychotic medication.1 Risk factors include young age, male sex, previous instance of acute dystonia, use of psychoactive substances, rapid titration, and use of high-potency antipsychotics.2 Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have a lower risk than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) to induce acute dystonia, significant differences exist between SGAs in their ability to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.3,4 The following case report describes a young male patient abusing amphetamine who, shortly after initiating low-dose risperidone, developed acute dystonia that did not occur with olanzapine use.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 24 year-old man, was admitted because of paranoid delusional thinking and agitation following daily use of amphetamine. He had no other medical history. A few months earlier, he had been hospitalized in the exact same circumstances and was treated successfully with olanzapine 10 mg daily without presenting any motor anomalies. Olanzapine was prescribed after discharge from the hospital, but Mr A stopped the medication a few weeks later. When he was readmitted more than 4 months later, risperidone orally disintegrating tablet 2 mg was introduced at bedtime. The following morning, the patient developed a sensation of thick tongue, had difficulty swallowing his saliva, and experienced neck and jaw rigidity. No respiratory difficulty was noticed. Within 30 minutes following the administration of diphenhydramine 25 mg intramuscularly, the dystonic symptoms diminished and resolved completely within the next few hours. Risperidone was replaced by olanzapine 10 mg at bedtime, and complete resolution of the psychotic symptoms was obtained without recurrence of dystonic symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe exact pathophysiology of acute dystonia remains unknown but probably involves blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum. It has been proposed that by blocking serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, SGAs increase dopamine release by substantia nigra neurons in the basal ganglia, which would explain the lower risk of dystonic reactions compared with FGAs. Psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are considered a precipitating factor for acute dystonia.5,6 Although these substances may initially enhance release of dopamine in the striatum,7 their long-term use is associated with striatal dopaminergic down-regulation.8 In our case report, amphetamine abuse appears to increase the risk of an acute dystonic reaction with risperidone but not with olanzapine. One could argue that the blood concentration of amphetamine had decreased by the time olanzapine was prescribed and this could reduce the risk of dystonia. However, on the first hospitalization the patient did not have a dystonic reaction when treated with olanzapine although he was taking similar quantity of amphetamine on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough both risperidone and olanzapine have similar binding affinities to dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, only olanzapine has significant anticholinergic properties.3 In our patient, the addition of the anticholinergic drug diphenhydramine to risperidone significantly reduced the dystonic symptoms, suggesting that acetylcholine is involved in some way in the etiology of this motor side effect. In a recent study, patients at risk for acute dystonia used anticholinergic drugs more often when treated with risperidone than with olanzapine.9 Therefore, blockade of 5-HT2 receptors alone by an SGA may not be sufficient to prevent a dystonic reaction in high-risk patients. In our patient, the induction of dystonic symptoms by risperidone was not likely due to an increase in dopamine D2 blockade by risperidone, as dose equivalence studies suggest that risperidone 3 mg is equivalent to olanzapine 10 mg.10,11\r\n\r\nThis case report suggests that low-dose risperidone, but not olanzapine, can induce an acute dystonic reaction when amphetamine abuse is present. We propose that the anticholinergic activity of olanzapine, in addition to its serotonin 5-HT2 blockade, contributes to the lower risk of dystonic reaction compared with risperidone. Therefore, an SGA having both anticholinergic and anti–serotonin 5-HT2 activity might be a better choice to prevent acute dystonia in high-risk patients.",

Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda. Hilangnya satu atau beberapa gigi dapat menyebabkan gangguan fungsi pengunyahan, bicara dan estetika yang dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan gangguan psikotik skizofrenia paranoid terhadap kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh. Pengambilan sampel dilakukan dengan cara Non-Probability Sampling dengan metode Purposive Sampling yang didapat sebanyak 24 orang subjek. Data yang diperoleh dari penelitian di analisis dengan Uji Chi-Square untuk melihat hubungan kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien skizofrenia paranoid dengan pengaruh lama konsumsi obat, jenis kelamin dan obat yang dikonsumsi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pada variabel jenis kelamin tidak memberikan hasil yang signifikan karena nilai p = 1.000. Namun pada variabel lamanya perawatan menunjukkan hasil yang signifikan karena p = 0.041 dan juga pada variabel obat yang dikonsumsi menunjukkan hasil signifikan dengan nilai p = 0.027. Hasil peneltian menunjukkan adanya Hubungan Gangguan Psikotik Skizofrenia Paranoid terhadap Kehilangan Gigi Sebagian pada Pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh secara signifikan terhadap lama konsumsi obat dan jenis obat yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien, namun tidak adanya hubungan signifikan terhadap jenis kelamin.\r Kata Kunci : Skizofrenia Paranoid, Obat Antidepresan, Obat Antipsikotik, Xerostomia, Karies Gigi, Kehilangan Gigi Sebagian.\r ABSTRACT\r Name\t\t\t : Cut Novera Riskina\r Study Programme\t : Dentistry\r Faculty : Dentistry\r Title\t: Relationship of Paranoid Schizophrenia Psychotic ..Disorders to Partial Tooth Loss in Patients in Mental ..Hospital\r Schizophrenia is a complex chronic mental health disorder characterized by a series of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, speech or irregular behavior, and impaired cognitive abilities. Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue and history and investigations should always be individualized. Management should initially aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes; however, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered. For optimal management the multidimensional components of fatigue should be assessed and future research is needed on the use of non-pharmacological treatment such as physical activity, counselling, and/or pharmacological agents such as a trial of psychostimulants or short course of corticosteroids.",

      "title": "The Need to Develop Innovative Interventions to Improve Treatment Adherence in Co-Occurring Severe Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Treatment nonadherence is a significant public health problem that spans medical and psychiatric populations, adding billions of dollars to healthcare costs [1]. Patients with chronic and severe mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as those with substance use disorders (SUDs) tend to exhibit high rates of nonadherence (e.g., 50% or greater) to their medication and psychosocial treatments [2-7]. Not surprisingly, then, nonadherence rates tend to be highest in SMI patients who also abuse drugs or alcohol compared with noncomorbid patients [8]. Nonadherence in co-occurring SMI and SUDs produces a host of negative consequences, including increased rates of relapse, hospitalization, suicide, and functional impairment [5,9-11]. Abrupt withdrawal from psychotropic medications for SMI can lead to a quick return of symptoms that is not just attributable to the original illness, but also due to potential rebound effects associated with withdrawal from medications [12,13]. Furthermore, premature treatment drop out averages 50% within the first few weeks of SUD treatment [4-6], which prevents early intervention that can alter illness trajectories and provide needed course corrections prior the development of clinical crises. Nonadherence also contributes to the so-called “efficacy-effectiveness gap” [14]. We spend large amounts of money and resources developing efficacious mental health treatments, but these interventions will have little public health impact unless patients view them as acceptable and adhere to them.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

      "abstract": "The quite diffused habit of a significant assumption of alcohol drinks, can interfere with the professional exposure to chemical substances. The interaction may result in increasing their toxicity and/or modifying the parameters of the biological monitoring. It may also act as a confounding factor, not only in epidemiologic researches but also at individual level when the assessment of the occupational exposure and/or the diagnosis of an occupational diseases, is under consideration. We review available references in the literature summarizing major scientific evidences.The interaction between the alcohol assumption and industrial chemicals may be toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic. Alcohol can interfere in the processes of biotransformation of xenobiotics and modify the doses and the effect indicators used for the biological monitoring, causing wrong interpretations of the results. The metabolism of ethanol can be altered by the exposures to toxic industrial materials, creating some clinical pictures of alcohol intolerance, like an \"antabuse syndrome\" or an \"degreaser flush syndrome\". Professional exposure to carbon sulfide or to dimethylformamides, trichloroethylene as well as to nitroglycerin and nitroglycole ethylenic can produce similar syndromes. Interactions are reported between alcohol and solvents: on toxicokinetic bases for methanol, isopropanol, glycol ether, trichloroethylene, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene; and on toxicodynamic bases for CNS. Also between alcohol and metals there can occur toxicokinetic interactions, like in the case of lead and mercury. Alcohol can also interfere with the biological monitoring of solvents, producing an over-estimation of the exposure.For the biological monitoring of reported chemical substances, it is suitable to evaluate the biologic indicators in the days in which there is not assumed alcohol. If this cannot be guaranteed, it is necessary to know at least the quantity of the alcohol consumed or at least if the subject is an alcohol abuser.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

      "title": "DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals. Management Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia. Genetic counseling DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for DYT1 dystonia are possible.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "abstract": "In many alcoholics, the severity of withdrawal symptoms increases after repeated withdrawal episodes. This exacerbation may be attributable to a kindling process. Kindling is a phenomenon in which a weak electrical or chemical stimulus, which initially causes no overt behavioral responses, results in the appearance of behavioral effects, such as seizures, when it is administered repeatedly. Both clinical and experimental evidence support the existence of a kindling mechanism during alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms, such as seizures, result from neurochemical imbalances in the brain of alcoholics who suddenly reduce or cease alcohol consumption. These imbalances may be exacerbated after repeated withdrawal experiences. The existence of kindling during withdrawal suggests that even patients experiencing mild withdrawal should be treated aggressively to prevent the increase in severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Kindling also may contribute to a patient's relapse risk and to alcohol-related brain damage and cognitive impairment.",

Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

The way of life of the individual who is dependent on alcohol is replete with incidents that are demoralising, waking daily with a hangover or with tremor and retching, coupled with amnesia for events of the night before, a sense of inability to face the day ahead and awareness of recriminations at work and at home. Little wonder that depressed mood is common in such circumstances. Similarly, the drug addict, when life is dominated by the daily problem of obtaining supplies of a substance that brings transient relief or pleasure but also experiences of an impoverished existence and low mood. Add to this the fact that the biological action of many commonly misused substances can induce depression then it is hardly surprising that depression is common in this population. There are also a smaller number who use alcohol or illicit drugs to cope with primary depression.

      "title": "Benzodiazepine Hypnotics and Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In summary, it is proposed that the more frequent or severe side effects associated with the newer triazolo-benzodiazepines are related to an interaction of several factors, including rapid elimination, high receptor-binding affinity, and unique chemical properties. Among benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam has a unique side effect profile for CNS adverse reactions in regard to type, frequency, and severity. All of the three factors mentioned contribute to this side effect profile: rapid elimination (the shortest half-life among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); high receptor-binding affinity (the highest among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); and unique chemical properties as a triazolo-benzodiazepine. Given these three factors, the drug's side effects can be understood as follows: Hyperexcitability states (daytime anxiety during drug administration and rebound insomnia following withdrawal) are related primarily to its rapid elimination and secondarily to the other two factors, whereas cognitive impairments (amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric symptoms) are related to the high binding affinity and unique chemical properties as well as to its rapid elimination. In contrast, benzodiazepines that are slowly eliminated and have only relatively moderate receptor-binding affinity (flurazepam) are unlikely to produce daytime anxiety and rebound insomnia and CNS adverse reactions such as cognitive impairment. The most common side effect, daytime sedation, is easily recognized and can be managed by dose reduction and/or intermittent use. This safety profile combined with the drug's high degree of efficacy both initially and with continued use provides a high benefit-risk ratio in using the drug in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Similarly, temazepam, which has relatively weak receptor-binding affinity produces very few CNS adverse reactions. Furthermore, temazepam (15 mg) is more efficacious than triazolam (0.25 mg). However, temazepam is not as effective as flurazepam, because it is slowly absorbed and therefore has limited efficacy for sleep induction. On the other hand, triazolam's safety profile of frequent and severe adverse reactions combined with the lack of efficacy for the current dose of 0.25 mg limits the drug's usefulness. In fact, the 0.25-mg dose has such a poor benefit-to-risk ratio that there is a real question as to whether the drug should remain on the market.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Toxicity from lithium can occur by overdose (intentional or accidental) or, more commonly, from alteration in its clearance by the kidney. We present two cases of lithium toxicity. The first is a 57-year-old male who presented with confusion, ataxia, and lethargy. The second case involves a 52-year-old female with bizarre behavior who was unable to care for herself. Both patients received dialysis and recovered without sequelae.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced acute dystonia is usually associated with combination therapies of neuroleptics, but rarely with the withdrawal or rebound effect of various psychotrops. Very sparse reports have described acute dystonia as a methylphenidate withdrawal (rebound effect), particularly in combination modalities. However, there is no case report or research regarding acute dystonia related to the withdrawal of the short-acting methylphenidate-immediate release form (MPH-IR) in the case of monotherapy of MPH-IR or a combination with guanfacine. Herein, a pediatric case of recurrent acute dystonia with two separate phenomena, locating orolingual and oromandibular/lower extremities, is presented as a withdrawal adverse reaction occurring after abrupt discontinuation of MPH-IR when under a combination therapy with guanfacine. Various options such as anticholinergic agents, re-administrating MPH, or turning to monotherapy from combination modalities, can be suggested in treatment, as well as only hydration may also have the benefit of resolving the symptoms, as in the current case. Practitioners should be aware of all possible adverse effects of MPH, even the rebound effect of short-acting forms.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

Anxiety in turn makes it more difficult for the patient to cope with suffering. In advanced disease, anxiety is often associated with depression. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale is a sensitive and specific tool for generalised anxiety which can also help in identifying accompanying depression. The differentiating feature is that patients may deny any severe anxiety, although sometimes anxiety is part of the drug effect. A single drug alone is an unusual cause unless higher doses are being used, or the patient is very young or elderly. The risk is much greater when two or more at-risk drugs are used together and this risk can be reduced by avoiding combinations of drugs with this effect. Pain that is not worsened by movement can make some patients restless, mainly as a distractive behaviour.",

During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness.

      "title": "Bipolar depression: the clinical characteristics and unmet needs of a complex disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective: We reviewed important clinical aspects of bipolar depression, a progressive psychiatric condition that is commonly treated in primary care. Bipolar depression is associated with considerable burden of illness, high suicide risk, and greater morbidity and mortality than bipolar mania.Methods: We identified articles relevant to our narrative review using a multistep search of the literature and applying terms that were relevant to bipolar depression or bipolar disorder.Results: Bipolar depression accounts for the majority of time spent unwell for patients with bipolar disorder; high rates of morbidity and mortality arise from full symptomatic episodes and interepisode subsyndromal symptoms. Bipolar depression is an important contributor to long-term dysfunction for patients with bipolar disorder due to psychosocial impairment, loss of work productivity and high rates of substance abuse. Missed and delayed diagnosis is prevalent due to overlapping symptoms with unipolar depression and other diagnoses. Medical comorbidities (i.e. cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome) and psychiatric comorbidities (i.e. anxiety disorder, personality disorder, eating disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are common. Currently, only three treatments are FDA-approved for bipolar depression; monotherapy antidepressants are not a recommended treatment option.Conclusions: Bipolar disorder is common among primary care patients presenting with depression; it is often treated exclusively in primary care. Clinicians should be alert for symptoms of bipolar disorder in undiagnosed patients, know what symptoms probabilistically suggest bipolar versus unipolar depression, have expertise in providing ongoing treatment to diagnosed patients, and be knowledgeable about managing common medication-related side effects and comorbidities. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical.",

Somatic and neuroimaging investigations showed no abnormalities.

Few of these neurotoxins act directly on neural cells, whereas others impair metabolic processes heavily reliant on the neurological system. Neurotoxicity can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, drug therapies, organ transplantation, and vulnerability to heavy metals such as mercury and lead, certain foods, pesticides, industrial products, and solvents used in cleaning cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Additionally, there are a few naturally occurring compounds. Symptoms of intoxication may begin to develop immediately upon exposure or may take time to manifest. These symptoms may include encephalopathy, limb weakness or numbness, cognitive and behavioral impairments. Following the elimination or decrease of exposure to hazardous chemicals, symptomatic and supportive therapy is provided. The prognosis is highly variable and depends on the duration and depth of vulnerability and the degree of the neurological impairment. Neurotoxicant vulnerability can be lethal in rare instances. Patients may survive in some cases despite their failure to heal completely. In other cases, many individuals recover completely following treatment.",

A computed tomographic scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is essential when the patient is acutely ill or has had several recent confusional episodes.

      "abstract": "LAS SUSTANCIAS QUE MODIFICAN LA PERCEPCION, LAS EMOCIONES Y/O el estado de animo son conocidas con el nombre generico de sustancias psicoactivas. Evidentemente en la practica clinica es deseable modificar un estado de animo con el proposito de aliviar la ansiedad generalizada, la depresion o un trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, por citar solo algunos ejemplos. Uno de los grandes logros de la medicina moderna es haber desarrollado farmacos eficaces para el tratamiento de diversos trastornos de animo con lo cual la calidad de vida de un gran numero de personas se ha incrementado notablemente. Gracias a este avance trastornos que en el pasado eran incapacitantes y requerian hospitalizacion pueden ser tratados en consulta externa con muy buenos resultados. Esto ha sido posible por la investigacion clinica y cientifica que ha llevado al desarrollo de nuevas moleculas, de diversas formas farmaceuticas y de regimenes de dosificacion apropiados para el tratamiento de distintos trastornos. Dentro de las sustancias psicoactivas no solo se encuentran las medicinas que controlan los trastornos del estado de animo, del sueno o de la ansiedad, sino las drogas de abuso, llamadas asi por su alta capacidad para producir adiccion. La experiencia indica que hay que ser cauteloso con los compuestos que conforman esta categoria ya que su consumo conlleva el riesgo de perder el control sobre la cantidad ingerida, con las consecuencias negativas asociadas para el sujeto y la sociedad. ?En que consisten las diferencias entre las medicinas psicoactivas y las drogas de abuso? La respuesta a esta pregunta es compleja y requiere tener en cuenta que los efectos de los farmacos dependen no solo de sus mecanismos particulares de accion sino de las condiciones de las personas que los consumen, del regimen de dosificacion (cuanto y cuando se toma), de la forma farmaceutica (pastilla, tableta dispersable, jarabe, ampolleta para inyeccion, parche de liberacion prolongada, etc.) y de la via de administracion. Por eso, una misma sustancia puede ser muy util cuando se usa de manera controlada en un hospital y muy peligrosa cuando se vende en el mercado negro como droga.

      "abstract": "Dangerous practices and games at school. Three separate categories of dangerous games can be distinguished. The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \"tomato game\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \"choking game\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \"Aggressive\" or \"violent\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.Pratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d’école sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxygénation ou d’évanouissement consistent, par un mécanisme de compression ou de strangulation, à rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d’agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de manière gratuite d’un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caractère répétitif dans le temps définit le harcèlement. La durée et l’intensité de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aiguës (oedème cérébral, perte de connaissance prolongée), des lésions cérébrales définitives (surdité, cécité, état grabataire), un coma irréversible, le décès. Les conséquences physiques des jeux d’agression sont très lourdes : fractures de la colonne vertébrale, traumatismes crâniens, ruptures d’organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques répétées. Les messages de prévention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une éducation à la citoyenneté (écoute, cohésion, solidarité, confiance en l’autre), le développement de compétences psychologiques et sociales de l’enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilités concrètes. Le repérage par les familles et les professionnels de symptômes chroniques évocateurs de ces pratiques permet d’éviter leur répétition et leur dangerosité encore accrue, voire un passage à l’addiction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychosis is a severe, acute or chronic mental illness that is characterized by reality distortion, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, catatonia, and impaired insight. Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

      "title": "Defining Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract An occasion of drug taking may be a passing indulgence of an adolescent, perhaps initiated in a moment of immature judgment. All too often, the drug taking can become repetitive and may lead to a syndrome of abuse or addiction, possibly in an interaction of inherited vulnerability traits with environmental conditions and processes. The development of addiction and the dependence syndrome in adolescents are emotion-laden, controversial, and often misunderstood topics. Public opinion leaders often do not appreciate the scientific evidence that tends to favor a disease concept of addiction or dependence on alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs such as cocaine or cannabis. This evidence includes a neuronal basis for many of the prominent clinical features of dependence, genetic vulnerability, and a characteristic chronic, relapsing course that resembles that of many medical illnesses. Unfortunately, these biological bases of addiction are often forgotten or misunderstood by a nonetheless opinionated American public that can view adolescent drug problems as purely behavioral and morally objectionable. Consequently, many affected adolescents end up being managed by their parents, school authorities, or the judicial system rather than being treated in specialized adolescent treatment programs. Even those seeking treatment often discover that appropriate programs do not exist in their geographic region or are difficult to access because of low capacity or managed care policies. While there would be a public uproar if treatment were not available to adolescents with head injuries, diabetes, or cancer, obvious disparities in addiction treatment have been tolerated for decades and may well reflect public skepticism about the biological bases of drug dependence and addiction. Unfortunately,we have much to learn about the onset, nature, and treatment of these conditions in adolescents. It is our contention that gaps in our knowledge should be addressed with research and clinical experience, and not cited to justify an inadequate treatment infrastructure.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities.

It omits evidence from key publications2,3 and twice misattributes statements to a paper that specifically excluded such deaths from the reported study.4\r\n\r\nThe current consensus on “restraint asphyxiation” is reflected in a guidance statement of the United States Department of Justice.5 Any person who is restrained prone has trouble breathing when pressure is applied to his or her back or when handcuffed and “hog tied,”2,3 and obesity exacerbates this. People’s natural reaction is to struggle more violently, which may be met with still more restraining force, resulting in greater oxygen deficiency and, in some cases, death. Risk factors include any condition, such as ischaemic heart disease or excited delirium,2 that increases susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias, as well as intoxication with alcohol or drugs. \r\n\r\nRecommendations given to police officers on how to prevent such deaths include releasing people from the prone position as soon as they are handcuffed, not sitting on them, and never tying handcuffs to a leg or ankle restraint (hog tying).5 A form of hog tying restraint known as the police leg lock was prohibited in Denmark in 1994, after a campaign by the human rights organisation Amnesty International when an incident had left an 18 year old permanently brain damaged.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a primary psychotic disorder characterized by two or more of hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and/or negative symptoms. At least one of the symptoms must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. There must be continuous signs of the disturbance for at least six months, although the duration may be shortened with appropriate treatment. The symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Active symptoms are typically preceded by a prodromal phase, marked by a decline in academic and social functioning. The assessment of an adolescent with suspected schizophrenia should include a psychiatric assessment and complete medical history to rule out medical conditions that mimic psychosis. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medications. Adjunctive psychological and social interventions can improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

      "abstract": "The taking of a careful history in patients with exophthalmic goiter commonly yields three important facts: (1) Information to the effect that one or more blood relatives is or had been suffering with \"nervousness,\" exophthalmic goiter, or diabetes mellitus; (2) the patient has been of more or less \"nervous\" temperament, characterized by irritability, impatience, fractiousness, and emotionalism, usually since childhood; (3) the onset of the symptoms of the disease followed soon after the occurrence of a psychic trauma. From the frequency with which such histories are elicited,it appears that there is a strong congenital predisposition to the disease. Indeed, in quite a series of the cases herein reported, two, three, and even four members of a family have been afflicted with exophthalmic goiter. In the absence of an exciting cause, such a predisposition may not be recognizable nor tangibly mar the individual's physical and mental well-being throughout a normal span of existence. There are doubtless many thousands of individuals possessing a strong susceptibility to exophthalmic goiter who are going through life in an apparently normal manner, oblivious to possibilities which would likely follow the incidence of a psychic trauma.",

      "abstract": "Encephalopathy is evidenced as an altered mental state with various neurological symptoms, such as memory and cognitive problems. The type of a substance-evoked encephalopathy will depend on the drug, substance, or combination being abused. The categories into which we could place the various abused substances could be tentatively divided into stimulants, amphetamines, hallucinogens, narcotics, inhalants, anesthetics, anabolic steroids, and antipsychotics/antidepressants. Other factors that may underlie encephalopathy, such as infectious agents, environmental, and other factors have also to be taken into account. Drugs of abuse can be highly toxic to the CNS following acute, but more so in chronic exposure, and can produce significant damage to other organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The damage to these organs may be at least partially reversible when drug abuse is stopped but CNS damage from repeated or prolonged abuse is often irreversible. The major pathways for the organ and CNS toxicity could be related to ischemic events as well as increased cell damage due to metabolic or mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in increased excitotoxicity, reduced energy production, and lowered antioxidant potential. These susceptibilities could be strengthened by the use of antioxidants to combat free radicals (e.g., vitamin E, lipoic acid); trying to improve energy generation by using mitochondriotropic/metabolic compounds (e.g., thiamine, coenzyme Q10, carnitine, riboflavin); by reducing excitotoxicity (e.g., glutamate antagonists) and other possible strategies, such as robust gene response, need to be investigated further. The drug-abuse-evoked encephalopathy still needs to be studied further to enable better preventative and protective strategies.",

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

      "abstract": "Aim. We report the case of two young subjects who developed an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during a heavy use of ecstasy. After several months of discontinuation of the drug, major depression with psychotic features developed in one subject and a psychotic disorder in the other individual. No mental disorder preceded the use of ecstasy in any subject. Findings. A familial and personality vulnerability for mental disorder was revealed in one subject, but not in the other, and all physical, laboratory and cerebral NMR evaluations showed normal results in both patients. Remission of OCD and depressive episode or psychotic disorder was achieved after treatment with a serotoninergic medication associated with an antipsychotic. Conclusions. The heavy long-term use of ecstasy may induce an alteration in the brain balance between serotonin and dopamine, which might constitute a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the onset of obsessive-compulsive, depressive and psychotic symptoms. The heavy use of ecstasy probably interacted with a vulnerability to psychiatric disorder in one subject, whereas we cannot exclude that an “ecstasy disorder” ex novo affected the other individual.",

Auditory hallucinations are especially likely to swiftly be considered due to psychiatric illness. An elderly patient with chronic auditory hallucinations without other significant psychopathology nor other symptoms prompted reflection and literature review. Objectives To review differential diagnosis of auditory hallucinosis. Methods Pubmed search for terms: auditory and hallucinosis. Results Hallucinations should be evaluated according to: type, onset and evolution, association with physical and /or neurological symptoms, association with other hallucinations and/or other psychopathology, characteristics. Auditory hallucinations may present along a continuum from tinnitus, simple, verbal, musical. The Pubmed search retrieved articles pertaining to auditory hallucinations associated with: 1. Sensory deprivation; 2. Hearing loss, auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome; 3. Dementia, neurodegenerative disorders; 4. Brainstem lesions; 5. Other central nervous lesions: thalamus, temporal, other; 6. Epilepsy; 7. Tic disorders; 8. Alcohol use disorders; 9. Borderline personality disorder; 10. Others. Conclusions Patients presenting with auditory hallucinosis should be carefully evaluated to exclude non-psychiatric disorders.

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

      "title": "Positive Psychological Aspects on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Traumatic Brain Injury.",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious condition which occurs in a person who has experienced a traumatic injury in which serious physical harm was experienced [1]. PTSD is a collection of traumatic ordeals which causes fear, anger, or horror, an accident, war, natural disaster or unexpected death of a loved one. Also, families of victims will show the PTSD. Most people, who experienced a traumatic event, will have reactions of shock, fear, anger and even guilt. These feelings will increase and continue, becoming strong and keep the person of having a normal life. PTSD after traumatic brain injury is rare and must be examined in relation to co-morbidities and other risk factors [2]. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs through sudden jolt to the head. Anyone can get the brain injury at any age. The most common causes of brain injury are closed to:- Head  injury  due  to  falls, road  traffic accidents, violation and assaults - Stroke - Subarachnoid haemorrhage - Hypoglycemia - Cerebral hypoxia which is prolonged  to  cardiac arrest - Cerebral infections - Carbon monoxide poisoning \r\n\r\nThese events occur suddenly with no warning. It often occurs under traumatic conditions. When the brain injury occurred can result to cognitive and physical disabilities. To challenge with acquired brain injury, there is a need to heal the associate cognitive, mental and emotional problems of the patient. A person with brain injury has major problems such as memory, concentration, empathic feelings, and difficulty in speaking. Perhaps, the most aspect which upset him is the combination of losses that effect on personal identity [3]. \r\n\r\nThe only one way to focusing on positive aspect is identify and recognizing of existing identity strength. Also, it is possible to recognize positive aspect of current situation. It could be involved of processes that range of simple comparison such as: “I walk lameness”, but since I have seen other people who are not able to walk at all, I realized how lucky I am”. “I have made some really good friends in hospital, but now as I think, I realized that family comes first before work.” \r\n\r\nPeople who have got brain injury may need permission to represent these types of idea and help to regulate them. Psychotherapy approaches to people who have brain injury need to be more directive than other groups. It is because that these peoples have more difficulty in generating these ideas due to the problems with administrative function from frontal lobe damage. They will benefit from quick alternative questions rather than obvious approach in formal psychotherapy practice [4].\r\n\r\nFocusing on positive aspects and approach can completely change the tone of a therapeutic collision and will light the mood of both patient and therapist. It seems that positive thinking to patients who have got brain injury is better than that administering the hint of depression. Patients will tend to leave the feeling of sadness and anxiety. To work with people who have got brain injury and have poor memory, the emotional tone is very important [5]. \r\n\r\nThe people with brain injury should accept and deal with the stress in their life. After treating bruises and bumps in hospital, people should going back to work and school and have normal life. People may have some trouble with work or school, but it is normal and could be frustrating. Therefore, thinking positive on posttraumatic stress after brain injury can support healing and fights depression and anxiety and allows the person to buildup healthy coping skills. Positive thinking also will strengthen immunity and help to fight with illnesses. The best method to positive thinking is replacing negative thoughts with positive. Most people are focusing on negatives and burst problems in their mind. They will imagine the worst things that happen. Positive thinking can be used to heal the problems and avoid thinking negative. Also, persons can surrounded him/her with positive peoples who will be able to support the patient mind. Therefore it is better to change the negative thoughts to positive which it will become automatically reaction.",

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

This is a report on a case with most of the features typical of NDEs except that it occurred entirely without any life-threatening conditions. This evidence is theoretically incompatible with either of the above hypotheses, suggesting that a broader interpretation of the phenomenon is needed.",

Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "abstract": "Zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine agent, is a widely prescribed drug among practitioners for short-term treatment of insomnia. Nevertheless, there have been a number of cases associated with the adverse effects of the stated drug recently. Many cases of serious complications induced by high dose of zolpidem have been reported. Further to the existing reports of adverse reactions to zolpidem, throughout the current manuscript, another case of zolpidem-induced loss of consciousness is going to be presented. The case had taken 100 mg of zolpidem and afterwards, went into an unknown status of narcolepsy, faint, seizure or transient coma. Overdosing zolpidem and being affected by its central effects, he performed risky actions such as cooking by a gas oven and eating meal while intoxicated. The current case suggests that zolpidem overdose might contribute to loss of consciousness and exhibition of high-risk behaviors.",

      "title": "Disulfiram-induced seizure in a patient with alcohol dependence syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Disulfiram (DSF) has been used in the management of alcohol dependence as a deterrent agent for over 50 years, and it has been shown to be efficacious when taken under supervision. In addition to the physical symptoms associated with the concomitant use of alcohol, DSF may lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when used alone, which are flushing, throbbing headache, perspiration, etc., DSF has an acceptable risk profile. However, it is associated with many adverse events and drug–drug interactions, including death. The most common less serious adverse effects include headache, sleepiness, tiredness, and halitosis (or metallic taste). Its toxicity may present different clinical aspects, though the mechanism (direct or idiosyncratic) remains unclear. Dermatological, neurological, psychiatric, and cardiac events have been reported. Serious side effects include hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, psychosis, seizures, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis.[1] There are very few case reports regarding DSF-induced seizures.[23] This shows the need for research, especially in the Indian context, when alcohol consuming population and the wide use of DSF (sometimes surreptitiously) in de-addiction centers are considered. However, because of the ADRs and the dangerous effects of DSF with alcohol, it has to be prescribed with caution and always monitored by medical supervision. Mr. SD, a 40-year-old married male, diagnosed with alcohol dependence for the past 5 years, presented with uncomplicated withdrawal symptoms. Detoxification was done using benzodiazepines in tapering dose, and oral thiamine supplementation was initiated. Investigations including complete blood count, blood sugar, and liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. After he gave written informed consent, DSF was started at a dose of 250 mg at daytime as an aversive agent and increased to 500 mg per day after 1 week. He was also receiving quetiapine 50 mg for sleep disturbances. His birth and developmental history was unremarkable. There was no past or family history of major medical or psychiatric illness. He had been on regular medications under the supervision of a family member and abstinent from alcohol. After 6 weeks, he presented with an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure, characterized by sudden-onset, tonic–clonic movements of the extremities with up rolling of the eyeball, frothing from the mouth, and tongue bite. Although there was no incontinence, the whole episode lasted for about 1–2 min. The patient remained confused for few minutes after the event. Subsequently, he was rushed to the hospital and admitted in the neurology ward. There was no history of alcohol intake during this period, or history of other substance abuse. After admission, he was treated with tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. All routine blood investigations (random blood sugar, serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and complete blood count) were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain revealed mild cortical atrophy, and electroencephalogram showed generalized spikes. He was discharged after 2 days with tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg at night, and tablet phenytoin 300 mg/day. After discharge, he continued to follow-up in the psychiatric outpatient department (OPD). Tablet phenytoin was tapered up after 1 month. After 4 months of discharge, there was no relapse of seizure. We did not restart tablet DSF considering a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. The patient is continuing to follow-up in the psychiatry OPD, maintaining abstinence now and seizure free without antiepileptic. Isolated seizure episode in a patient with alcohol dependence can be because of various reasons such as alcohol withdrawal, head injury under the influence of alcohol, or electrolyte imbalance or related to drugs. The Possibility of withdrawal seizure was ruled out as he had one episode of seizure after 6 weeks of stopping alcohol. As per family members and his gamma-glutamyl transferase level, it was clear that he did not take alcohol before admission to the hospital. As CT scan of the brain did not reveal any head injury and his electrolyte levels were normal, these two reasons can be excluded as the reason for seizure. When the patient had seizure, he was on tablet DSF 500 mg/day, tablet lorazepam 1 mg/day, and tablet quetiapine 50 mg/day. As there was no history of seizure in the past and no relapse of seizure after stoppage of DSF and antiepileptic, it indicates a possibility of DSF-induced seizure. To substantiate our assumption, we applied Naranjo Scale for adverse effect and the score was 7, which indicates its probable causal relation between DSF and seizure.[4] This pattern of adverse effects appearing with increase in duration of drug exposure has been described in the nervous system. There is literature to suggest that the latency time from the start of treatment to the manifestation of the ADR differed according to the organ. Hepatitis occurred with a distinct peak after 2 months of treatment, skin reactions peaked after 2 weeks, and the rate of neurological ADR increased with the duration of therapy.[5] There are rare case reports of seizures associated with DSF. A recent review of literature revealed few reports in which the patients had generalized convulsions.[6] Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a toxic metabolite of DSF, increases the release of glutamate from striato-cortical synaptic vesicles, suggesting a possible mechanism for DDC-mediated neuronal damage and development of seizures.[7] Norepinephrine depletion with DSF exacerbates seizures and facilitates seizure kindling.[8] DSF has a moderate record of adverse effects. Apart from DSF alcoholic reaction, evidence suggest that DSF when used alone can cause various side effects including seizures, which are rare but need to be considered. Awareness among clinicians about DSF-induced seizures in the management of alcohol dependence appears practical to prevent misdiagnosis of seizures attributable to other reasons.

      "abstract": "The clinical presentation and neurobiology of depression in youth and its appropriate treatment, as well as strategies for improving therapeutic benefit and preventing adverse outcomes, including suicide, are reviewed.Functionally impairing depression occurs in 2-10% of children and adolescents. A diagnosis of depression should be considered when a physically healthy child exhibits depressed mood or anhedonia, multiple somatic complaints, or behavioral changes, such as bullying, aggression, and social withdrawal. Risk factors for depression include childhood trauma, genetic susceptibility, and environmental stressors. Antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy are the most effective treatments for adolescents with depression. Youth are at risk for the same adverse effects as adults but have an increased risk of behavioral activation, or switch, to mania and suicidal thoughts and behaviors early in treatment. Compared with other antidepressants, fluoxetine has the most evidence for safety and efficacy, particularly in adolescents 12 years or older. There is very little evidence for the effectiveness of any antidepressant in children 11 years and younger. Youth receiving antidepressants should be monitored closely for new-onset or worsening suicidality, particularly during the first two weeks after starting medication, and for three months of therapy. Behavioral activation, aggression, worsening depression, anxiety, insomnia, or impulsivity can herald a switch to mania or suicidality.Depression in youth is common and treatable and responds best to multimodal treatment combining patient and family education, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressant medication. The potential benefits of antidepressants outweigh the risks for adolescents. Family and psychotherapeutic interventions are most effective for prepubertal children.",

It produces feelings of pleasure, warmth, distorted sensory time and perception. MDMA increases the activity of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. It causes various health effects such as nausea, sweating, chills, muscle cramping, etc. The effect of this drug can be seen in 3 to 5 hours in the body. A spike in body temperature can be seen in MDMA users that can be fatal as it affects the liver, kidney, and heart leading to death. Addiction to MDMA is not yet proven, however, withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue and depression are noted. MDMA is usually taken via the mouth or snorting in the form of tablets or capsules. This drug is also taken or abused along with other drugs such as LSD, alcohol, and marijuana. MDMA is a scheduled drug with no proven medical use. MDMA causes a surge of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain to regulate mood, learning, memory, stress, anxiety, etc. This chapter discusses the effects of MDMA on the human brain.",

      "title": "Depletion of Nicotine Dependence and Abstinence Syndrome (Withdrawal Symptoms) of Tobacco Smoking by Using Banico Emulsion (Poly Herbal Formulation) in Sprague Dawley Rats",
      "abstract": "Smoking is slow poison which could be the cause of death for all its users.\r\nThe cause of dependence to smoking is due to the presence of nicotine other then nicotine\r\ncommercially marketed cigarettes contain many chemical compounds which results in\r\nvarious diseases like cancer, COPD, ischemic cardiac disorders, renal and hepatic\r\ndysfunction ,oxidative stress and also causes impairment of memory and condition\r\nprogresses additional cognitive abilities or impact. Abstinence syndrome is major cue for\r\nsmoking\r\nAs per the previous studies of plant materials(active constituents )used in the\r\nformulation of Banico Emulsion conclude that the active constituents can deplitiate the\r\nsomatic and non-somatic signs appeared in abstinence syndrome and indirectly decreease\r\nthe dependence to nicotine. The somatic signs are assessed observing the animals directly\r\nduring the dependence and abstinence syndrome period and concluded whether the animals\r\nare recovered by the treatment with Banico Emulsion. The non-somatic signs are assessed\r\nby using various different parameters namely actophotometer, elevated zero maze, marble\r\nburying method , morris water maze and rotarod\r\nOverall withdrawal symptoms appeared to meetall the stated criteria for nicotine\r\nabstinence syndrome. signs appeared far more frequently after 16-24 hours after the\r\ntermination of both NHT and CS in their respective methods. The frequency of signs were\r\nfar greater in previously induced rats than in contol animals. Abstinence signs were\r\nsignificantly decreased with the treatment of banico emulsion.sharp transient decrease in\r\nactivity provide additional evidence to differentiate the dependence, absitnence and\r\nrecovery period.\r\nActophotometer is the parameter to assess the locomotor activity and anhedonia\r\nduring the Dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to exhibit an locomotor percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected\r\nproduce increased locomoter activity due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased locomotor activity during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased locomator activity and decreased stress of the animals.\r\nElevated zero maze is the parameter to assess the conditioned fear during the\r\ndependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. The ability to alternate requires\r\nthat the rat know which arm they have already visited.Normal rat are expected to exhibit an\r\nalteration percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce increased due to\r\neuphoria during the dependence period followed by decreased alteration during withdrawal\r\nperiod due to the decrease in dopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.\r\nAccording to the animals which were either NHT or CS induced increased depression due\r\nto the termination of nicotine in withdrawal period. but animals treated with banico\r\nemulsion produced a significant decrease in a conditioned fear which was comparable to\r\nthe untreated control which in turn indicates the increased alteration and decreased\r\nirritability or confusion of the animals.\r\nMorris water maze task represents more specific for spatial learning and memory.\r\nThe essential feature of this technique is that rats are placed into large circular pool of\r\nwater and can escape into a hidden platform. Thus, the platform offers no local cues to\r\nguide escape behavior and the rat can escape from swimming by climbing on to the\r\nplatform apparently learns the spatial location of the platform any starting position at the\r\ncircumference of the pool. The only spatial cues are those outside water tank are primarily\r\nvisual cues. Thus, the versatility of the task makes it a widely acceptable experimental\r\nmodel for the assessment of cognitive tests. Typically, the induced animals exhibited a\r\ndecrease time for escape latency during dependence period followed by an increase time\r\nfor escape latency indicating loss of visual cues to escape n to the platform during\r\nwithdrawal period. Such a diminished cognition was reversed by the administration of the\r\nBanico Emulsion at the specified dosage levels and exhibited escape latency (EL),\r\nindicating the well- developed spatial memory in spite of NHT or CS induced abstinence\r\nsyndrome. Marble burying behavior is the parameter to assess the anxiety related behavior\r\nduring the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period. Normal rat are\r\nexpected to bury marble upto percentage of 60-70. The induced rats are expected produce\r\nincreased burying of marbles due to euphoria during the dependence period followed by\r\ndecreased burying of marbles during withdrawal period due to the decrease in dopamine,\r\nnor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain. According to the animals which were either\r\nNHT or CS induced increased burying of marbles due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with Banico Emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased burying of marbles and decreased anxiety of the animals.\r\nRotarod is the parameter to assess the muscle contraction property and\r\ntremors(somatic sign) during the dependence , abstinence syndrome and treatment period.\r\nNormal rat are expected to exhibit an musle fall off time 50-60 seconds . The induced rats\r\nare expected produce increased fall off time due to euphoria during the dependence period\r\nfollowed by decreased fall off time during withdrawal period due to the decrease in\r\ndopamine, nor epinephrine and serotonine levels in brain.According to the animals which\r\nwere either NHT or CS induced increased fall off time due to the termination of nicotine in\r\nwithdrawal period. but animals treated with banico emulsion produced a significant\r\ndecrease in a depression which was comparable to the untreated control which in turn\r\nindicates the increased fall off time and decreased tremors of the animals.\r\nnAchr's receptors are involved in cognitive and memory functions and several\r\nstudies have suggested their roles in dependence. Marked cholinergic deficit is a hallmark\r\nof the pathogenesis of smoking dependence and various drugs including NRT and nicotine\r\nblockade therapy have designed to target abstinence syndrome but failed to delpetiate\r\ndependence to either nicotine or other drugs. There was a significant elevation in the level\r\ndopamine, nor-epinephrine and serotonine\r\nPrevious studies concluded that anti oxidant property like SOD and GSHPx\r\n(glutathione peroxidase) in the animals treat the dependence and abstinence syndrome of\r\ncigarette smoking . It has been suggested that antioxidant might contribute to the prevention of dependence and abstinence syndrome. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)\r\nconstitutes a mutually supportive team of defense against reactive oxygen species. The\r\nmost remarkable effect of banico emulsion is increased activity of SOD in hippocampus.\r\nTreatment with banico emulsion preserved the reduced SOD to that of the normal control.\r\nGlutathione (GSH) is the major non-protein thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells\r\nand is considered the main intracellular redox buffer. GSH protects cellular protein thiols\r\nagainst irreversible loss, thus preserving protein function The administration of banico\r\nemulsion significantly preserved the activity of GSH, GPx in the hippocampus to similar\r\nlevel observed in normal control mice. The restoration of activities of GSH, GPx banico\r\nemulsion might promote scavenging of free radicals using recycled GSH from GSSG .CONCLUSION: The new methodology of inducing the cigarette smoke induced similar dependence\r\nand abstinence Syndrome when compared with the standard method of NHT induce\r\nDependence and abstinence Syndrome method. The new method induced the other\r\nCarcinogenic and Oxidative stress effects on all Body Parts.\r\nThe selected dose 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of banico emulsion showed significant\r\naction on nicotine dependence and abstinence Syndrome but higher dose 400mg/kg showed\r\nbetter action than lower dose 200mg/kg.\r\nThe present study relieved the action of Banico Emulsion on nicotine hydrogen\r\ntartarate and cigarette smoke induced Nicotine Dependence and Abstinence Syndrome in\r\nSD rats. From the results it can be concluded that Banico Emulsion had remarkable effect\r\nin Abstinence Syndrome which is followed by reduced Nicotine Dependence. Further\r\nstudies are required for the identification of molecular level action and individual\r\nphytoconstitutent on depletion action.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Iatrogenic Comorbidity in the Interaction between Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy in Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in the setting of anxiety disorders is often viewed as a potential source of augmentation of clinical effects, with little attention paid to the potential occurrence of negative events. In most of the studies, however, if benefits ensued, they were modest and likely to fade. Further, 4 high-quality and well-designed individual studies suggest that the addition of a benzodiazepine or an antidepressant to cognitive behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders could be detrimental compared to placebo at follow-up. The aim of this review was to outline a novel hypothesis, which needs to be adequately tested but may shed some new light on this interaction. Any type of psychotropic drug treatment, particularly after long-term use, may increase the risk of experiencing additional psychopathological problems that do not necessarily subside with discontinuation of the drug or of modifying responsiveness to subsequent treatments. The changes are persistent and not limited to a short phase, such as in the case of withdrawal reactions, and cannot be subsumed under the generic rubrics of adverse events or side effects. The term ‘iatrogenic comorbidity' refers to unfavorable modifications in the course, characteristics, and responsiveness of an illness that may be related to treatments that were administered previously. The likelihood of iatrogenic comorbidity needs to be considered in clinical practice: The concurrent use of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may yield advantages in the short term, but its costs at some later point in time may largely outweigh such benefits.",

      "title": "A triple-risk model for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and the apparent life-threatening episode (ALTE): the stressed magnesium deficient weanling rat.",
      "abstract": "A triple risk model for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as described by Filiano and Kinney involves the intersection of three risks: (1) a vulnerable infant, (2) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control, and (3) an exogenous stressor(s). The triple risk model aptly describes the dynamics of an animal model for SIDS: (1) a vulnerable animal that is young and magnesium deficient: (2) a critical developmental period revealed by hyperirritability, labile cardiovascular and respiratory control; and (3) an exogenous stressor such as soft, high-pitched noise; motion or handling; or a chill. Together these three risks may trigger a shock-like episode of apnea, unconsciousness and bradycardia. The lung is the shock organ. An animal that dies quietly or after physical activity following the episode, models SIDS. However, if the shock-like episode resolves spontaneously or after resuscitation, the survivor is a model for an apparent life-threatening episode (ALTE). If, while still in the critical developmental period the ALTE survivor is stressed again, there is a risk for a recurrent episode, with the final outcome still unpredictable but with increasing risk for SIDS with multiple recurrences. The purpose of this communication is to present an illustrated review of the magnesium deficient weanling rat as an animal model for SIDS/ALTE, showing pertinent physical, electrocardiographic and pathological features. In the weanling rat, magnesium deficiency appears to be the single common pathway upon which multiple stressors may impinge to produce sudden death during the relatively brief critical developmental period, while magnesium supplements may protect the animal. If significant magnesium deficiency is subsequently diagnosed in a properly controlled study of human SIDS tissue, it is likely that a high proportion of SIDS deaths could be prevented by simple oral magnesium supplementation to infants during the first critical weeks and months of life.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnia due to a medication or substance is suspected when symptoms occur temporally in relation to exposure to an exogenous substance, such as a drug, and improve upon discontinuation of the exposure. Zolpidem is among the most commonly prescribed medications for insomnia in Korea. However, parasomnia has sometimes been reported to occur post its usage. Here, we present two cases of patients taking zolpidem for insomnia who experienced dangerous events while asleep that they did not recall upon waking. The nature of these events was so perilous that they posed a threat to the patients’ lives. While one patient sustained a bodily injury, the other was at risk of a potentially fatal injury. However, these parasomnias did not recur after discontinuation of zolpidem.",

      "abstract": "Carbon monoxide poisoning usually results from inhalation of exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, smoke from fires or fumes from faulty heating systems. Carbon monoxide has a high affinity for hemoglobin, with which it forms carboxyhemoglobin. The resulting decrease in both oxygen-carrying capacity and oxygen release can lead to end-organ hypoxia. The clinical presentation is nonspecific. Headache, dizziness, fatigue and nausea are common in mild to moderate carbon monoxide poisoning. In more severe cases, tachycardia, tachypnea and central nervous system depression occur. When carbon monoxide intoxication is suspected, empiric treatment with 100 percent oxygen should be initiated immediately. The diagnosis is confirmed by documenting an elevated carboxyhemoglobin level. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is recommended in patients with neurologic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction or a history of unconsciousness.",

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

      "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that psychiatric and/or psychological factors could be independent risk factors for stroke. Some of these factors may act as stroke triggers producing short-term physiological changes that may directly lead to stroke onset. Most data is related to four distinct domains: (1) depression and/or anxiety and related syndromes, (2) personality and character traits, (3) psychological stress, and (4) psychotropic medication. Some factors (e.g., depression) are closely related to stroke risk, and there is some evidence that psychological stress could be an important risk factor. However, many studies have methodological limitations (small sample size, lack of adjustment for stroke risk factors, or residual confounding) and lack of standardized definition and/or measurement. Data about stroke triggers is scarce but epidemiological studies suggest a triggering effect of acute or subacute life stress exposure. The potential pathophysiological ways by which psychiatric and/or psychological factors may promote stroke include a higher frequency of unhealthy behaviors and direct biological effects on the cardiovascular system, notably through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. More research is still needed to improve measurement and to better investigate the impact of psychiatric and/or psychological factors. The clarification of pathophysiological mechanisms could help to consider preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling. In rodents, for instance, drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine have been reported to elicit climbing, jumping, rearing, prancing, running, walking, circling, revolving, pivoting, gnawing, licking, nose-poking, sniffing, verticalization, side-to-side head and paw movements, backward locomotion, and underwater swimming without surfacing (e.g. Alander etal.1983; Cole 1977; Costall and Naylor 1973; Decsi et al.1979; Fray et al.1980; Janssen et al.1960; Jerussi and Glick 1976; Kokkinidis and Anisman 1979; Schijljrring 1971; Schoenfeld et al.1975; Segal et al.1980; Szechtman et al.1982; Teitelbaum 1986; Thomas and Handley 1978; Voigtlander eta/.1975).

Its hallmark feature is hypophosphatemia, although other electrolytes might also be affected. Fanconi syndrome is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule characterized by proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and proteinuria. The etiology of Fanconi syndrome can be either acquired or inherited, and drugs, among them tenofovir, are a common acquired cause of this disease. We present the case of a patient with AIDS and polysubstance abuse who was admitted due to pneumonia, completed treatment, was then started on antiretroviral medication (ART) that included tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and began presenting severe episodes of hypophosphatemia along with other electrolyte imbalances, leading the workup denoted in the case, severe complications and finally to the patient's demise. Most cases of tenofovir-related Fanconi syndrome are related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but very few cases have been reported with TAF.

      "title": "Inflammation: Depression Fans the Flames and Feasts on the Heat",
      "abstract": "Depression and inflammation fuel one another. Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate. Accordingly, treatment decisions may be informed by attention to questions of how (pathways) and for whom (predispositions) these links exist, which are the focus of this article. When combined with predisposing factors (moderators such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogens can lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, disturbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained inflammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promote intestinal permeability, another pathway to enhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symptom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a substantially greater impact on mood in individuals with heightened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating them in tandem may enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.",

Evaluation of concussion involves assessments of multiple domains or clinical profiles, including vestibular, ocular, headache, cognitive, mood, fatigue, and other systems. Initial management consists of a short rest period followed by increasing activity that does not exacerbate symptoms. Cognitive modifications for school or work also are initiated early in the management plan. Use of other management modalities is based on findings from the physical examination. Imaging may be needed in cases of worsening or progressive symptoms. When athletes have returned to baseline symptom burden and have returned to school or work, they may transition to a return to play/sport progression. Most sports-related concussions resolve within 2 weeks for adults and 4 weeks for adolescents.

Also, already diagnosed absence epilepsy can become worse, e.g. by recurring absence seizures or grand mal seizures or the new onset of grand mal on awakening. 2. Exogenous factors, like changing the time of sleeping and waking, lack of sleep and the abuse of alcohol, play an important role in these types of epilepsy. Cutting out these factors is just as important as the consequent drug treatment on a longterm basis. 3. Drug treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy will be done with valproate, barbiturates and ethosuximide. Regarding fatal complications of liver function, which are more frequent than previously thought of, valproate can be recommended as a drug of first choice, especially in early childhood and when a combination of drugs is used. 4. A very good effect of adolescence is seen in children with benign idiopathic focal epilepsy with a centro-temporal spike focus. Antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine as an agent of first choice can be done less vigorously. 5. Menstruation usually only modifies but does not worsen the natural course of epilepsy. There is still no real therapeutical plan for this rare form of epilepsy. 6. It cannot be a general rule, not to change current medical treatment before or during puberty in order to avoid any worsening of seizures. A decision always has to be made regarding the form of epilepsy and the individual situation, which has to be discussed with the patient and perhaps his family.",

      "abstract": "Medical Review article in portuguese about Brain Death<br>ABSTRACT<br>Brain death represents the irreversible medical condition in which the brain functions (telencephalon and diencephalons) and the brainstem are hopelessly compromised. Three prerequisites are necessary to define it, that is: irreversible coma with known cause; absence of hypothermia, hypotension or severe metabolic disorder; exclusion of exogenous intoxication, or psychotropic drugs effect. It is based on the concomitant presence of coma unresponsive to external stimuli, absence of brain stem reflexes, and the presence of apnea. The diagnosis is established after two clinical tests with an interval of at least six hours, carried out by two different professionals not linked to the transplant team. It is mandatory to prove, through complementary exams, the absence of central nervous system perfusion, or electric activity or metabolism. Brain death means death both legally and scientifically. It is necessary for all health care professionals, especially the physician, to be familiar with the concept of brain death, so that the application of life support technology is beneficial, individually and socially committed, not only to promote inadequate intervention, extension of suffering and familiar distress and futile and artificial prolongation of life<br><br>RESUMO<br>A morte encefálica representa o estado clínico irreversível em que as funções cerebrais (telencéfalo e diencéfalo) e do tronco encefálico estão irremediavelmente comprometidas. São necessários três pré-requisitos para defini-la: coma com causa conhecida e irreversível; ausência de hipotermia, hipotensão ou distúrbio metabólico grave; exclusão de intoxicação exógena ou efeito de medicamentos psicotrópicos. Baseia-se na presença concomitante de coma sem resposta ao estímulo externo, inexistência de reflexos do tronco encefálico e apneia. O diagnóstico é estabelecido após dois exames clínicos, com intervalo de no mínimo seis horas entre eles, realizados por profissionais diferentes e não vinculados à equipe de transplantes. É obrigatória a comprovação, por intermédio de exames complementares, de ausência no sistema nervoso central de perfusão ou atividade elétrica ou metabolismo. Morte encefálica significa morte tanto legal quanto cientificamente. É necessário que todo profissional de saúde, especialmente o médico, esteja familiarizado com o conceito de morte encefálica, para que a aplicação da tecnologia na sustentação da vida seja benéfica, individual e socialmente comprometida, e não apenas promovedora de intervenção inadequada, extensão do sofrimento e angústia familiar e prolongamento inútil e artificial da vida.<br><br>",

These issues can for example result from experiencing extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, tornadoes, wildfires, and droughts. These events can cause Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and other psychological disorders, such as anxiety, panic attacks, sleep disorders, compulsive repetitive play, flashbacks, depression, psychosomatic sickness, and paranoia. These can in turn increase for example the number of suicides. Also, climate change can impact our mental health through environmental changes. For example, higher surface air temperature can disrupt sleep, and cause mood, behavior, and neurotic disorders, and schizophrenia. And sea level rise can increase people's stress levels and lead to for example depression.",

A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

      "abstract": "Participation in endurance activities is popular and growing. Proper hydration is important for performance and to avoid medical complications. Overconsumption of fluids, in combination with inadequate secretion of the hormone arginine vasopressin can lead to exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH). These two factors are the main underlying mechanism for the development of EAH, leading to water retention and a dilutional hyponatremia. EAH is defined biochemically by serum \nsodium concentrations < 135 mol/L during or up to 24 hours after exercise. Athletes may be asymptomatic, or symptomatic, with mild cases presenting with non-specific symptoms and signs, such as nausea, vomiting or weight gain. Severe cases or cases of exercise associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE) may present with headaches, altered mental state, seizures or coma and represent a medical emergency. Treatment is warranted with intravenous hypertonic saline solution and can be lifesaving. Other risk factors include exercise duration over 4 hours, exercising in the heat or humid conditions, event inexperience, inadequate training, slow running pace, high or low body mass index (BMI) and free availability of fluids at races. Prevention can generally be achieved by adhering to appropriate hydration strategies, such as drinking to thirst. \nEducation of athletes, coaches and medical personnel about EAH is important and may help reducing the incidence of EAH and prevent further fatalities.",

Clinical effects are typically dose dependent, though calculating toxic doses is often difficult due to variable potencies of certain drugs and an often unknown quantity of ingestion. Decontamination is the mainstay of treatment and, when appropriate, may consist of emesis induction, activated charcoal administration, or gastric lavage. No specific antidote exists for most recreational drugs. Treatment is largely supportive. Intralipid therapy may be considered in certain cases. Secondary complications, such as aspiration and organ dysfunction, may be seen. Prognosis can be good with prompt decontamination and treatment.",

Una vez diagnosticada y tratada, la evolucion de la enfermedad puede ser a una recuperacion completa del paciente, tan- to en lo sintomatico como en lo funcional. Sin embargo, es frecuente, en este periodo de la vida, que la enfermedad depresiva sea re- currente y que por tanto haya que mantener el tratamiento antidepresivo durante varios anos o de manera continuada. Tambien resul- ta habitual que algunos de los sintomas no respondan de la misma manera al tratamiento farmacologico o de psicoterapia. En este caso, pueden hacerlo mas tarde que los sintomas nucleares o quedar como sintomas residuales. Estos sintomas pueden tener tanta importan- cia y repercutir de tal manera en la vida de los pacientes que condicionen el pronostico de la enfermedad que padecen. Los sintomas cognitivos, la ansiedad y las alteraciones de los ritmos biologicos, sobre todo el sueno, son los que requieren una mayor atencion, pero las ideas de muerte y de suicidio, los sinto- mas somaticos y la apatia constituyen tam- bien sintomas para tener en cuenta.

It is the first cause among patients who commit suicide at this age, generates great suffering in the patients and in their family, and is a source of significant disability due to the disease itself and the impact on the evolution of other comorbid diseases. Once diagnosed and treated, the evolution of the disease can be to a complete recovery of the patient, symptomatic and functional recovery. Howe- ver, it is frequent, in this period of life, that the depressive illness would be recurrent and that therefore it would be necessary to main- tain the antidepressant treatment for several years or continuously. It is also common that some of the symptoms do not respond in the same way to the pharmacological treatment or psychotherapy. In this case, they can do it later than core symptoms do, or remain as residual symptoms. These symptoms can be so important and affect in such a way the life of the patients that condition the prognosis of the disease they suffer. Cognitive symp- toms, anxiety and alterations of biological rhythms, especially sleep, are those that re- quire more attention, but the ideas of death and suicide, somatic symptoms and apathy are also symptoms to be taken into account. Finally, some patients have resistant forms and do not respond to the treatment used, or they do it very partially. This article aims to review possible evolutions, to approach therapeutic harassment possibilities, and, finally, to examine some issues in the lives of these patients that could influence the coping of the disease.",

Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Restless legs syndrome (RLS) or Ekbom syndrome is characterized by abnormal and unpleasant sensations (paresthesias or dysesthesias) involving the lower extremities that become apparent or worsen at rest, especially in the evening at bedtime, and are relieved, at least transiently, with movement. Sensations often involve both legs but can be unilateral or may alternate between lower extremities. Common complaints include a sensation of creeping, crawling, tingling, wormy, throbbing, pulling, burning, or increased “tension” located deep within the legs (rather than affecting the skin superficially) when sitting or lying down. Some patients are simply unable to describe adequately the sensation they feel. Although symptoms are typically not described as painful, a complaint of pain does not exclude the diagnosis. These uncomfortable sensations extend from the feet and ankle proximally to the legs and, occasionally, thighs. Similar sensations have also been described in the arms. Symptoms tend to occur at night, although unpleasant sensations may emerge during the daytime during prolonged periods of immobility (eg, airplane flights). There is often an accompanying irresistible urge to move the limbs (motor restlessness) to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Less frequently, an isolated urge to move is present without any accompanying unpleasant sensations.",

      "abstract": "It is difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or psychiatric background, coexisting disorders or drug-induced side effects. The aim of this paper is to present two cases of psychotic symptoms (bipolar and paranoid disorder) induced by chloroquine. Case 1: Severe depressive episode with psychotic features appeared in the context of third SLE exacerbation and chloroquine treatment. Hydroxychloroquine was used instead and symptoms resolved. Later, manic episode (with psychotic features) emerged several days after chloroquine was prescribed for concomitant arthritis. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Case 2: The second patient started to suffer from headaches and being lightheaded three days after chloroquine administration and within next few days feeling of derealization and poorly defining persecutory delusions accompanied by strong anxiety with occasional visual illusions occurred with clear consciousness. After eighteen days chloroquine was withdrawn and after two days all the symptoms resolved. Clinicians should be vigilant for possible psychiatric disorder when using chloroquine in patients with SLE. Such cases are probably rare and may include both paranoid and bipolar spectrum disorders. Studies on interactions of chloroquine with brain neurotransmitter systems are needed. Hydroxychloroquine may represent lower risk considering psychiatric complications. Mechanism of the difference is currently not known.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive effects and sedation (CES) are prevalent in chronic nonmalignant pain populations receiving long-term opioid therapy and are among the most common reasons patients discontinue opioid use. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

      "title": "Exercise for depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is a common clinical condition, affecting over 120 million people worldwide. People experience pervasive, sustained feelings of sadness and hopelessness, persistent loss of interest, enjoyment and motivation as well as disruptions in areas such as appetite, sleep, concentration and energy levels. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and produces a greater decrement in health than chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes and angina. Conventional treatments centre largely on pharmacological and psychological strategies, either on their own or in combination; but these are not acceptable to everyone. Antidepressant treatment can be complicated by side effects and drug interactions, and psychological therapies require motivation from the participant. Patients may also reject both antidepressants and psychological therapy because of perceived stigma. For several decades, exercise has been investigated as an alternative therapy for depression and several mechanisms have been proposed for its potential efficacy. It may provide distraction from negative thoughts or enhance a sense of self-efficacy through mastering a new skill. Social contact through exercise may also have a positive impact on mood and, from a more biological perspective, changes to circulating monoamines or endorphins, or reductions in the stress hormone cortisol, may also play a role. This review set out to conduct a meta-analysis of randomized trials of the effect of exercise in people with depression. We included studies comparing exercise with no treatment, as well as those that compared exercise with psychological or antidepressant approaches. The current version updates the earlier Cochrane Review, first published in 2009. We included trials of adults with a diagnosis of depression as defined by the original researchers. In assessing the intervention, we were guided by the American College of Sports Medicine definition of exercise as \"planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness\". We identified 39 trials, recruiting approximately 2300 participants, drawn from a variety of sources including inpatient and outpatient populations, as well as from the general public by media advertising. A diagnosis of depression was made either by structured diagnostic interview or through the use of rating scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The included trials varied widely with respect to the type of exercise, as well as its duration and frequency or the overall \"dose\" of exercise. Of the 39 trials, 32 provided aerobic exercise such as running, cycling, walking or dance; with 4 providing muscle-strengthening resistance training. Other trials provided a combination of aerobic and resistance training. There were further differences with respect to whether exercise was conducted alone or in groups, indoors or outdoors, supervised or unsupervised. Our main finding was that when compared to a control intervention, there was a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as when we analysed the six trials that were considered high quality, the effect size was clinically small and not statistically significant. A series of subgroup analyses suggested that a larger number of exercise sessions may have a greater clinical effect on mood and that resistance training or a mixture of aerobic and resistance training may be more efficacious than aerobic training alone. When exercise was compared with antidepressant medication, there was no statistical difference between the two interventions. Likewise for psychological therapy, our findings revealed no difference between this and an exercise intervention. The nature and extent to which exercise may have an effect on mood remains uncertain. Most included trials were small and many had methodological weaknesses. One inherent difficulty in these studies is that it is not possible to blind participants allocated to exercise. A further potential source of bias is that outcome measures for depression are often gathered from self-rated scales of depression, completed by the participants themselves before and after the intervention. The evidence in this review would be strengthened by further large-scale, high-quality studies, where all participants are diagnosed with depression through structured clinical interview and receive exercise as a stand-alone intervention. Further research comparing exercise with either anti depressant medication or psychological therapies, would also help resolve uncertainties about the choice between these options.",

      "abstract": "Various factors contribute to a predisposition towards the excessive consumption of alcohol: socio-demographic factors, a disturbed family background or certain neurological disorders in childhood, a family background of heavy drinking or total abstinence, or a genetic predisposition towards the biochemical reactions of excessive drinking. Alcohol dependence is the last of several stages which begin with drinking on \"social occasions\" during adolescence or even childhood, which may lead to certain people drinking excessively in certain social surroundings; this may easily become a habit if the subject moreover suffers from psychological problems inducing him to consume greater quantities more frequently to overcome inhibitions or to escape. This increased consumption leads in turn to psychological dependence, and toxicomania becomes apparent since if drinking is suddenly stopped, giving rise to neuro-vegetative disorders, these only disappear when further alcohol is consumed. This vicious circle is completed by psychological problems affecting personal relationships and professional activities. Thus for the alcoholic, for whom at the outset drinking was usually merely a social habit, the consumption of alcohol has become an escape from the reality of his situation, often drinking solely to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and therefore the appropriate therapy in these cases is detoxication.",

Before the development of effective treatment, mortality rates among severe cases were as high as 15%. The exact mechanisms underlying withdrawal, and their relationship to the complex disorder of alcoholism, remain unknown. Is withdrawal merely a side effect of chronic alcohol abuse? Or are the processes that result in withdrawal fundamental to the process of addiction? Among the many symptoms and consequences of alcohol abuse, the withdrawal syndrome is one of the most puzzling. Although withdrawal symptoms can appear in an intoxicated individual, it is generally agreed that the syndrome intensifies as ethanol (EtOH) levels fall. The syndrome may continue to worsen long after the direct effects of EtOH have become negligible, and the severest form of withdrawal in humans can appear as many as five days after the last drink (Victor and Adams, 1953).",

In spite of the users' tenet,--that the drug is a \"safe\" one,--it is evident that Ecstasy has late effects as well,--for example a single dose may induce Parkinson's like symptoms.

      "abstract": "Lethal catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are both rare and life-threatening problems. The clinical presentations are very similar, with striking features of altered mental status, fevers, and muscle rigidity. Lethal catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that was first described in the early 1800s, 100 yrs before the use of neuroleptics and other antipsychotic agents. Presently, it appears that this disorder may be an extension and terminal event of excited catatonia. Modern psychopharmacologic practice has almost eliminated this lethal progression. This syndrome is most commonly associated with underlying psychiatric pathology, but may rarely be associated with organic disease. Severe hyperthermia is one of the most striking changes that occurs with lethal catatonia along with a wide spectrum of abnormal behavior, including severe lability of mood, anorexia, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, mutism, catatonia, and muscle rigidity. Hyperthermia may culminate in death secondary to dehydration, end-organ failure, and cardiovascular collapse if it is unrecognized or refractory to therapy. Therapy consists of aggressive supportive therapy, antipsychotic agents, and, on occasion, electroconvulsive therapy (1). The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon, but severe, adverse reaction to antipsychotic and neuroleptic medications. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and an alteration in the level of consciousness. Patients frequently have increased WBC counts and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is reported to have a mortality rate of approximately 20%. The syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from lethal catatonia, infectious etiologies, central nervous system pathology, malignant hyperthermia, toxic encephalopathy, hyperthyroidism, tetany, parkinsonism, and drug overdose or toxin ingestion (2–5). We present a patient who developed lethal catatonia, which was initially, successfully treated with an antipsychotic drug. However, the patient subsequently developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic challenges of this clinical situation are reviewed.",

      "title": "Intravenous Ketamine for Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness and Guidelines",
      "abstract": "Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a condition that affects patients with depression who have not achieved an adequate response to conventional antidepressant therapies. TRD is commonly defined as major depressive disorder (MDD) with at least two prior treatment failures given adequate dose and duration. For patients with bipolar disorder, TRD is defined as a minimum of one prior treatment failure. Compared to non-treatment resistant MDD, TRD is associated with reduced quality of life, social and occupational impairment, comorbidities, and higher likelihood of prior suicide attempts. Patients with TRD are twice as likely to be hospitalized than patients with non-treatment resistant MDD; and increased hospitalization is associated with substantially increased resource utilization., Risk factors for TRD include old age, divorced or widowed marital status, and concomitant psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and personality disorders.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs as a response to a traumatic event or extreme stressor (such as military combat, sexual assault, torture, being kidnapped, severe car accidents, and natural disasters). Patients experience symptoms that may include emotional impairment due to depression, anxiety, flashbacks, insomnia, feelings of guilt of having survived, and difficulty concentrating. In 2008, the Canadian lifetime prevalence rate of PTSD was estimated to be 9.2%.Antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are commonly prescribed agents for depression, while electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the gold standard and a late-line therapy for TRD.,Ketamine is a N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that leads to increased synaptic plasticity and may elicit a rapid antidepressant response in individuals with depression.In Canada, a number of formulations of ketamine are approved for general anesthesia. However, antidepressant effects of ketamine have been observed in animal models of depression and in human studies of depression, and ketamine has showed potential as a novel, rapid-acting therapeutic option for patients with TRD and PTSD., The purpose of this report is to update the previous 2017 CADTH report and to examine the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and evidence-based guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine for adults with TRD or PTSD.",

      "title": "Assessing the symptoms associated with excited delirium syndrome and the use of conducted energy weapons",
      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

TremorDrug-induced tremor is typically postural or kinetic, or both.It is symmetrical and occurs acutely following drug ingestion or dose escalation.Exceptions include tremor secondary to valproate, which can appear at therapeutic or during stable treatment, or, rarely, tardive tremor.Tremor can occur secondary to many drugs, including SSRIs, lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics (particularly valproate), bronchodilators, amiodarone and immunosuppressives.Another underlying aetiology, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor or hyperthyroidism, needs to be excluded.Management consists of altering the dose of, or if possible stopping, the offending drug, or switching to an alternative drug.Should the offending drug need to be continued, discuss the risks of the adverse effects versus the benefits of continuing to ensure the patient is informed.If the drug is continued, drugs typically used for essential tremor (for example, propranolol) can occasionally be beneficial.

      "title": "Understanding stress: characteristics and caveats.",
      "abstract": "Exposure to stressful situations is among the most common human experiences. These types of situations can range from unexpected calamities to routine daily annoyances. In response to stressors, a series of behavioral, neurochemical, and immunological changes occur that ought to serve in an adaptive capacity. However, if those systems become overly taxed, the organism may become vulnerable to pathology. Likewise, the biological changes, if sufficiently sustained, may themselves adversely affect the organism's well-being. Several factors may dictate an individual's response to environmental stressors, including characteristics of the stressor (i.e., type of stressor and its controllability, predictability, and chronicity); biological factors (i.e., age, gender, and genetics); and the subject's previous stressor history and early life experiences. Research on the physiological and psychological responses to different types of stressful stimuli is presented, focusing particularly on processes that may be relevant to the development of alcohol use disorders. Stressful events may profoundly influence the use of alcohol or other drugs (AODs). For example, the resumption of AOD use after a lengthy period of abstinence may reflect a person's attempt to self-medicate to attenuate the adverse psychological consequences of stressors (e.g., anxiety). Alternatively, stress may increase the reinforcing effects of AODs.",

Su principal mecanismo de accion es la inhibicion de la acetilcolinesterasa, aunque poseen un amplio conjunto de dianas de toxicidad. Las repercusiones neurotoxicas de la exposicion a agentes organofosforados incluyen el sindrome colinergico, el sindrome intermedio, la neuropatia retardada y los procesos de tolerancia debidos a la exposicion repetida. Bajo diversas circunstancias, la exposicion a estos compuestos ha sido asociada con el desarrollo de deficit cognitivos y alteraciones emocionales. Estos efectos han sido frecuentemente estudiados en animales de laboratorio, e inmediatamente despues de la exposicion repetida o cronica. Son frecuentes tambien los estudios clinicos en humanos que muestran la existencia de alteraciones neuropsicologicas persistentes tiempo despues de la exposicion o el envenenamiento con agentes organojosforados. El presente trabajo fue llevado a cabo con dos objetivos principales. En primer lugar determinar, mediante un modelo animal, la existencia de repercusiones cognitivas persistentes tras la exposicion a dosis no sintomaticas del organofosforado clorpirifos. En segundo lugar, caracterizar en terminos psicologicos los efectos encontrados, asi como establecer su curso temporal. El primero de los objetivos fue abarcado mediante una serie de tres experimentos en los que se empleo una tarea espacial de adquisicion repetida en laberinto de agua, de dos o cuatro ensayos. La evaluacion de la ejecucion de los animales fue realizada a los 6 meses desde el final del tratamiento con una o dos dosis no sintomaticas de clorpirifos.

Its development in a hospitalized patient may interfere with his or her management, disrupt ward routine, and cause medicolegal complications as a result of patient injury. Acute onset of a fluctuating level of awareness, accompanied by sleep-wake cycle disruption, lethargy or agitation, and nocturnal worsening of symptoms, are diagnostic.

      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

Common presentations include: (1) generalized convulsive status epilepticus or complex partial status epilepticus that continue despite initial therapies; (2) stupor or coma following a generalized convulsive or complex partial seizure; or (3) stupor or coma following brain surgery or acute brain injury. When status epilepticus continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the initiation of anesthetic therapy, or recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia, it is termed super RSE. Published evidence on optimal management of RSE consists largely of case reports or small series. The mainstay of treatment is the administration of anesthetic agents titrated to electrographic seizure control. Adjunctive therapies include hypothermia and immunosuppression and less commonly, surgery, electrical stimulation therapies, and induction of ketosis. Patients with cardiopulmonary complications and prolonged duration of drug-induced coma tend to have worse post-treatment functional outcomes. However, significant improvement over time can occur in survivors, and thus treatment is justified even in patients who require prolonged anesthetic coma. The strongest predictors of outcome are duration of anesthetic coma, etiology, and development of cardiopulmonary complications.",

Nevertheless, bipolar depression does have telltale signs--remembered with the mnemonic WHIPLASHED--to guide diagnosis. (2-8) Worse or wired when taking antidepressants.

Patients with hyperthymic temperament show persistent traits such as intense optimism, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, extroversion, and overconfidence.

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder with a wide range of changes in mental functions, primarily affectivity, and is manifested by dysphoric mood and reductive changes in cognitive, conative and other psychic dynamisms, with the presence of psychosomatic disorders and suicidal thoughts.There is always a triad of symptoms involved: alteration of affectivity, anhedonia and low energy with fatigue, but in it’s clinical picture there are other symptoms, such as guilt and powerlessness, obsession with “ black thoughts “ with loss of self – confidence, with hopelessness, loss of apetite, and weight loss with insomnia or hypersomnia present and more frequent thoughts of death because of worthlessness in life.Severe depressive disorder is not a homogenous mental disorder but a complex of clinical fenomena with subtypes, it is a series of special syndromes or clinical forms arranged continuously from lower to highest intensity of psychopathological clinical signs with or without psychoticisam to a high degree of risk for suicide. Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder. The presented data on a global level indicate that in the world and in the Balkan 7.5 % of patients are treated in hospital.

      "abstract": "The use of muscle relaxants in E.C.T. constitutes an important advance in psychiatric practice. The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "title": "Psychotic Cannabis Withdrawal: A Clinical Case",
      "abstract": "Cannabis use has been associated with several psychiatric comorbidities and there appears to be a dose-response relationship between the intensity and duration of its use and the risk of psychosis. More commonly, acute episodes of cannabis induced-psychosis manifest immediately following exposure, are precipitated after the use of large amounts of cannabis, resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic disorders. Cannabis withdrawal symptoms usually manifest when heavy, prolonged consumption of this substance is interrupted or significantly reduced. The withdrawal syndrome may include sympathetic autonomic hyperactivity, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and reduced appetite. On the other hand, cases of psychosis induced by cannabis withdrawal are rare. In this case, we present a 32-year-old healthy woman without personal or family psychiatric history who showed a heavy and continued consumption of cannabis since she was 10 years old, without developing any psychiatric symptoms. However, recently she experienced two brief psychotic episodes with disorganized behavior and persecutory delusions, both episodes happening a week after discontinuing cannabis consumption.",

      "title": "Smoking induced worsening of dystonia a case report",
      "abstract": "Several biochemical abnormalities have been observed in the brain of patients with primary dystonia, mainly involving norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine.1 Another neurotransmitter that is also probably involved in dystonia is the cholinergic system, as evidenced by the response to treatment with anticholinergics. However, it is not clear which of these is pathophysiologically related to the development of dystonia.1 There are only three published reports which suggest an association between nicotinic cholinergic system and dystonia, however with conflicting roles.2-4 We report here a patient with multifocal dystonia, predominantly cervical, which used to worsen after smoking and later showed improvement with anticholinergics and cessation of smoking, thus supporting the role of nicotinic cholinergic system in dystonia. Our patient was a 31-years-old man symptomatic for the past 10 years with difficulty in speaking which had increased in severity over the past 2 years. It was characterized by difficulty in pronouncing the words clearly with nasal quality to voice and occasionally he also felt that he had to strain more while speaking. For the past 2 years he also noted abnormal posturing of the neck in the form of turning towards right side, which was associated with neck pain, and difficulty in moving the neck sideward. There was no history suggestive of dystonia affecting other parts of the body, no sleep benefit or diurnal fluctuation, exposure to any toxins or neuroleptics. He did not have any significant family history of neurological illness. The patient was a chronic smoker, smoking cigarette for more than 6 years. However, recently, for the past few months, he noted that after smoking 1 to 2 cigarettes his abnormal movements of neck as well as the neck pain worsened significantly. This used to occur approximately 5 to 10 min after smoking and lasted for an hour. On examination he was found to have involuntary movements in the form of rotation of head to right side, elevation of right shoulder, mild retrocollis, facial grimacing, pouting of lips and increased frequency of blinking. When he spoke these abnormal movements worsened and he had predominantly adductor type of dysphonia. In addition he had mild postural tremors of both hands and minimal dystonia of both hands was noticed on walking. Rest of the neurological and systemic examinations was normal. There was no Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea and the MRI of brain was normal. The patient was further evaluated, using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) before and after smoking to objectively confirm the symptomatic worsening of the cervical dystonia reported by him. The TWSTRS score was 36 before smoking (baseline) (Video Segment 1), 45.5 5 minutes after smoking 2 cigarettes (Video Segment 2), and again reduced to 35.5 2 hours after smoking. He also had increased blinking, worsening of facial grimacing, and neck pain after smoking, but no evidence of worsening of hand dystonia. The patient was started on trihexyphenidyl 2 mg/day and slowly increased to 30 mg/day. He was also counseled regarding the benefits of smoking cessation. After 3 weeks of therapy he showed significant improvement in his symptoms both pain and dystonia and the TWSTRS score was 24.5 (Video Segment 3). During this period patient also had stopped smoking completely. He continued to maintain improvement at follow up visit after 4 weeks. There are three previously published reports which had shown a possible role of nicotine in the pathophysiology of dystonia.2-4 These reports had showed that nicotine improved in dystonia in 2 patients and worsened in another 2 patients.2-4 The patients who had worsening with nicotine had primary dystonia in the form of writer's cramp.3 On the contrary, the 2 patients with dystonia who had shown improvement with smoking and subsequently with nicotine had dystonia due to underlying secondary causes. One patient had developed dystonia after an encephalitic illness4 and other had developed dystonia following childhood hemiplegia.2 It is noteworthy that both these patients had associated spasticity, thus having secondary dystonia. The differences in the etiologies of dystonia probably contributed to the difference in the response to nicotine in patients with dystonia. Similar to that reported by Murase et al.3 in writer's cramp which is a form of primary dystonia, our patient who had, predominantly cranial dystonia, also worsened with smoking and subsequently showed improvement with smoking cessation and anticholinergics. The exact mechanism of effect of smoking and nicotine in either improving or worsening dystonia is unknown, primarily because there are only few documented cases. The major component of cigarette smoke that is responsible for addiction and other effects on the central nervous system is nicotine, which acts through nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChR).5 Nicotinic receptor activation after smoking facilitates the release of neurotransmitters. Most of this release is believed to occur via modulation by the presynaptic nAChRs. Other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and endorphins are released as well, mediating various behaviors of nicotine. There is also evidence of both nicotine and cigarette smoking improving symptoms of Parkinson's disease6 and this may be a result of augmentation of release of dopamine from the basal ganglia.7 Finally, dopamine-depleting agents or blockers have been used in treating dystonias. Therefore, it is not surprising that cigarette smoking or nicotine can aggravate primary dystonias as demonstrated in our patient and that reported by Murase et al.3 Smoking or nicotine induced worsening of dystonia could be also due to facilitation of release of acetylcholine8 or stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Since our patient also had benefit from trihexyphenidyl, which is only a muscarinic receptor blocker, the former mechanism can at least be implicated in the worsening of dystonia. In summary, our case illustrates a rare and interesting observation, which needs to be studied further. Apart from clinical documentation, functional imaging in dystonic patients before and after smoking may be useful in elucidating the role of smoking in dystonia. Finally, for evaluation of the efficacy of any medical or therapeutic interventions in a patient of dystonia who is also a smoker, concomitants effects of smoking should also be considered.

      "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that involves (1) compulsivity to seek and take alcohol, (2) difficulty in limiting alcohol intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (e.g., dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) in the absence of alcohol. Alcohol addiction encompasses a three-stage cycle that becomes more intense as alcohol use progresses: <italic>binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect</italic>, and <italic>preoccupation/anticipation</italic>. These stages engage neuroadaptations in brain circuits that involve the basal ganglia (reward hypofunction), extended amygdala (stress sensitization), and prefrontal cortex (executive function disorder). This chapter discusses key neuroadaptations in the hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic stress systems and the critical role of glucocorticoid receptors. These neuroadaptations contribute to negative emotional states that powerfully drive compulsive alcohol drinking and seeking. These changes in association with a disruption of prefrontal cortex function that lead to cognitive deficits and poor decision making contribute to the chronic relapsing nature of alcohol dependence.",

      "title": "Cocaine-Positive Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: From Avoiding Case Cancellations to Treating Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "See Article, p 308 The impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on the management of anesthesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures covers a broad spectrum, from the acute effects of intoxication to chronic effects such as altered anesthetic drug metabolism or a predisposition to perioperative organ injury.1 SUDs, which are characterized by the persistent use of a substance despite adverse consequences, including health problems, are extremely common. For example, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is 13.9%.2 For the less common substances encompassed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) SUD definition (amphetamines, cannabis, club drugs, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin, nonheroin opioids, sedative/tranquilizers, and/or solvent/inhalant use disorders), the 12-month prevalence is still 3.9%.3 The immediate dilemma for the anesthesiologist presented with a urine toxicology result that is positive for cocaine, or any of the substances included in the DSM-5 SUD definition, is then whether to (1) postpone the elective surgery or (2) proceed with the anesthetic while anticipating potential problems associated with the urine toxicology result. While option (1) may seem the \"safest\" from a provider's point of view, unanticipated cancellations of surgery come at steep costs. In addition to the financial implications of unused operating room time, prolonged patient suffering, worsened patient experience, and treatment delays resulting in worsened clinical outcomes due to disease progression represent potential consequences to case cancellations.4 The higher prevalence of SUDs in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations5 with limited access to care makes a decision to postpone an elective procedure even more consequential. The acutely cocaine-intoxicated patient may display hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and convulsions, and management of anesthesia in such patients has been described for parturients, fetuses, and neonates.6 Cocaine-using patients presenting in a clinically nontoxic (asymptomatic) state, defined as normal blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and normal or unchanged electrocardiogram, have been shown to receive general anesthesia safely for scheduled elective surgery in a prospective cohort study including 40 cocaine-positive patients.7 In the current issue of the Journal, Moon et al8 report on a single-center prospective cohort study evaluating the association of a positive preoperative urine test for cocaine and intraoperative hemodynamic events in a cohort of 327 asymptomatic patients with a history of cocaine use. Hemodynamic events were defined as a mean arterial blood pressure of <65 or >105 mm Hg, or a heart rate of <50 or >100 beats per minute. They found that the 173 asymptomatic cocaine-positive patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia had similar percentages of intraoperative hemodynamic events when compared to 154 cocaine-negative patients. Moon et al's8 current study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that urine toxicology results positive for cocaine, per se, may not reflect an absolute contraindication to proceeding with a surgical procedure.7,9,10 While this is undoubtedly a critical conclusion, we would like to contextualize these results with respect to (1) the prevalence of polysubstance use, particularly multiple stimulants, and (2) the effectiveness of in-hospital interventions on SUD trajectories in general. POLYSUBSTANCE USE A complicating factor for patients with cocaine use disorder is the concomitant use of other substances. Accordingly, patients with polysubstance use (except marijuana) were excluded from Moon et al's8 study. However, a patient presenting with a urine toxicology result positive for cocaine plus an additional substance may be quite common. For example, in a sample of 706 rural methamphetamine users in the United States, 35% reported using both methamphetamines and cocaine.11 The example of concurrent cocaine and amphetamine use (which could also be present among cocaine users who use prescription stimulants) illustrates why surgical patients with polysubstance use may demand a more conservative approach. Since both substances can lead to a hypermetabolic state, including tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, the risk for adverse perioperative outcomes is amplified in these patients. Specific conditions such as serotonin syndrome may further be triggered by preoperatively administered medications and pose a unique risk to polysubstance users. An isolated positive urine toxicology result for cocaine in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may lead to alterations in the anesthetic care plan, but not necessarily postponement of the surgical procedure. However, the detection of other substances in addition to cocaine may still merit delaying an elective procedure, even if the patient appears asymptomatic. Obtaining urine toxicology results as a part of the preoperative assessment in patients at risk for SUD is a requirement to make an informed decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery. IN-HOSPITAL INTERVENTIONS ON SUDS SUDs may have contributed to the presenting complaint that necessitated a surgical procedure and pose challenges to the recovery process after anesthesia and surgery. Hospitalizations, in general, offer the opportunity to administer interventions beyond the primary admission diagnosis, especially in populations that are otherwise unlikely to seek regular primary care. The standard of care in this setting is screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), which quickly assesses the severity of a patient's substance use, identifies the appropriate level of treatment, and attempts to increase insight regarding substance use and motivation for behavioral change. SBIRT can be implemented by a wide range of health care personnel with varied backgrounds. The efficacy of SBIRT has been well described for common SUDs. A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions for smoking cessation in hospitalized patients found that only high-intensity behavioral interventions that began during a hospital stay and lasted a minimum of 1 month after discharge were effective.12 Interestingly, interventions of low intensity or shorter duration were not successful in this study. Yet, brief interventions administered in the preadmission clinic before elective surgery have shown success in reducing smoking rates at 1 year with a number needed to treat of 5.9.13 Similarly, for perioperative alcohol use, a recent Cochrane review summarized the results of 3 clinical studies.14 The authors found that alcohol cessation interventions significantly increased the number of participants who quit drinking alcohol during the intervention period and likely reduced the number of postoperative complications.14 SBIRT approaches have been successfully implemented across a variety of different health care sites, including emergency departments and urgent care centers, inpatient hospital settings, and outpatient and community-based clinics, and have shown success in regard to reducing cocaine use specifically.15 SBIRT has also been shown to improve functioning in other domains that may have been associated with the initial complaint that brought the patient to medical attention, including general health, mental health, employment, housing status, and criminal behavior.15 Thus, postoperative hospital-based intervention for SUDs following a positive urine toxicology result for cocaine or another substance may decrease future substance use and increase the likelihood that patients adhere to postoperative care recommendations and do not require subsequent readmission. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The study by Moon et al8 may help anesthesiologists who must make a challenging decision when faced with the dilemma of canceling versus proceeding with a scheduled case in a patient with cocaine use disorder and an isolated positive urine toxicology result. In addition to safely shepherding our patients through the intraoperative course, opportunities for expansion of our practice exist. Future study may focus on how to best manage patients presenting with polysubstance use, as well as hospitalization-based interventions geared at the long-term reduction of illicit drug use in these patients.

      "abstract": "To the Editor.— Buspirone is a new anxiolytic agent of the azaspirodecanedione class. A nonbenzodiazepine compound, it differs from the benzodiazepines in several important ways. It does not (a) have any anticonvulsant activity, (b) interact with the benzodiazepines or alcohol, or (c) have a demonstrated abuse potential. 1 In many ways, it is ideally suited for the treatment of mild to moderate anxiety. However, since buspirone does not interact with the benzodiazepines, it does not protect against benzodiazepine withdrawal. Such withdrawal can present as either a minor or a major abstinence syndrome, with the former being more frequent and preceding the latter. The minor abstinence syndrome consists of anxiety, restlessness, anorexia, dysphoria, and insomnia. In the major abstinence syndrome, withdrawal phenomena include grand mal seizures, delirium, and psychosis. 2,3 Withdrawal phenomena are documented for benzodiazepines with a long (eg, diazepam) or short (eg, lorazepam) half-life. These syndromes are probably more",

      "title": "First Episode Psychosis Following COVID-19 Vaccination: a Case Report.",
      "abstract": "Vaccines are crucial to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine can cause mild to moderate side effects. A number of cases of cardiac, gastrointestinal, and psychiatric side effects have been reported as rare side effects associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. This article presents a patient, who after the second injection of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, immediately developed anxiety, nonspecific fear, and insomnia as the prodromal phase of psychosis. Starting from the second week, the patient manifested delusions of persecution, delusions of influence, thoughts insertion, and delusional behaviour, culminating in the suicide attempt. The duration of psychosis was eight weeks, and symptom reduction was observed only after the gradual administration of antipsychotics over four weeks. The investigations of the patient did not support any structural changes of the brain, any severe medical conditions, a neurological abnormality, a confusion or a state of unconsciousness or alterations in laboratory tests. Psychosis due to the use of alcohol or psychoactive substances was excluded. The psychological assessment of the patient demonstrated the endogenous type of thinking, and the patient had schizoid and paranoid personality traits strongly associated with schizophrenia. This case indicates a strong causal relationship between the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine injection and the onset of psychosis. We intend to follow up this case for possible development of schizophrenia and understand that the COVID-19 vaccine could possible play a trigger role in the development of primary psychosis. Longer-term supporting evidence is needed to estimate the prevalence of psychosis following vaccination with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.",

      "title": "Cross-Addiction: From Morbid Obesity to Substance Abuse",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex phenomenon that continues to defy one unifying scientific explanation. Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome presents with neuromuscular, autonomic, and mental status changes. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia-like presentations can be precipitated by multiple organic and medication-related causes. Psychiatric causes of catatonia are typically associated with underlying psychotic or mood disorders. Recurrent catatonia without other precipitating psychiatric diagnosis is rarely described. We present the case of a man in his early 30′s with idiopathic recurrent catatonia, presented with patient consent. Our case presented in a catatonic state, having recently stopped using cannabis. No organic cause for his presentation was identified following extensive investigation and he was admitted for psychiatric assessment. During admission he slowly improved with benzodiazepine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment, alongside psychological support. Despite near complete recovery, he significantly relapsed on 2 occasions requiring psychiatric re-admission over the subsequent 6 months. Thereafter, he had multiple relapsing episodes with decreasing severity during rehabilitative care. During admission we explored extensive differentials including mood disorders, schizophrenia or psychosis, drug abuse or poisoning, as underlying triggers for his catatonia. He had a finding of FIRDA (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity) on his second electroencephalogram (EEG), with no clinical correlate of seizure or structural abnormality. We found no evidence of any underlying psychiatric or organic cause for his presentation. In contrast to classical descriptions of catatonia or recurrent catatonia, our case highlights the need for greater recognition of isolated idiopathic catatonia, as a diagnosis independent of mood disorder or schizophrenia. Furthermore, we evidence effective recovery with psychological support, benzodiazepines and ECT.",

We report the case of a male patient with SLE who presented with an exacerbation of bipolar disorder triggered by chloroquine. Firstly, when the patient was diagnosed with SLE, he underwent six months of therapy with chloroquine without any psychiatric symptoms. Later, the SLE returned and the patient was prescribed chloroquine again, without any mental illness. When the third exacerbation of SLE occurred, it coincided with a severe depressive episode with psychotic features that became aggravated for the first time after the administration of chloroquine. The chloroquine was subsequently replaced with hydroxychloroquine for the next six months without any behavioral problems, following which, the SLE and mood disorder were in remission. Later, a bipolar disorder relapse occurred, manifested by a manic episode, and in the following three months, despite psychiatric treatment, a manic episode with psychotic features developed four days after chloroquine was prescribed for arthritis. It was the second time that the mood disorder was exacerbated by chloroquine. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Our case points out that although chloroquine-induced psychosis is rare, patients presenting with behavioral changes need physicians’ attention in order to diagnose early and efficiently treat encountered mood disorders.",

      "title": "Melancholia in the Subjunctive Mood",
      "abstract": "Grammarians tell us that even our verbs have a “mood,” and these moods clue us into people’s disposition toward their topic. The three moods in English are the indicative, the imperative, and the subjunctive. It is interesting to look at the mood (in the grammatical sense) of “mood disorders” (in the psychiatric sense), because when people talk about psychiatric mood disorders—like depression—the first two grammatical moods are very common. But the last is quite rare. The indicative is the matter-of-fact mood of description and explanation. Examples include “depression is a malfunctioning limbic diencephalic system” or “depression is the result of anger turned inward.” The imperative mood is the stern request or command: “Take your medicine!” or “You should see a shrink!” The subjunctive mood, by contrast, infrequently shows up. This mood indicates a much more whimsical disposition. It is used to express wishes, possibilities, and fantasies. The subjunctive is the mood of “what if?” Some examples are “depression might be many things” and “I wonder what would happen if we were to think about depression this way or that way.”The loss of the subjunctive with regard to depression is unfortunate because the cultural and phenomenal world of depression, whatever else we may want to say about it, is a world of uncertainty and a world of multiple points of view. When we use the indicative and imperative moods to discuss depression, we cover over this uncertainty and multiplicity. We make it seem as if depression were clearer than it really is. And, more important, we close down our options and limit our flexibility. We lose the capacity to imagine, to fantasize, and to creatively consider the advantages and disadvantages of the many possible ways of making sense of depression.Gary Greenberg’s book is a delight to read because it is a sustained meditation on depression that stays largely in the subjunctive mood. Greenberg uniquely comes at the project from several different points of view: he is a science writer (and a good one at that), a psycho-therapist, a historian, an investigative journalist, a patient of depression, a volunteer for clinical research trials, and—perhaps most important—by the time you finish the book, something of a friend. At least, I felt like I was in the presence of a friend, because Greenberg does a nice job keeping the reader company with his own often humorous and thought-provoking reflections about his project. Using his multiple hats, Greenberg explores the rise of psychiatric diagnosis, the insights of Freud and psychoanalysis, the controversies over talk therapy versus medications, the remarkable power of pharmaceutical marketers to get inside our heads, the experience of taking medications, the role of insurance companies and America’s can-do attitude in the promotion of cognitive-behavioral therapy, how yesterday’s phrenology compares with today’s neuroscience and neuroimaging, and even how a magical afternoon taking ecstasy and fooling around with a room full of naked strangers can relieve depression.Since this is a review, I cannot go into the details but must move straight to the big questions. What does Greenberg find out about depression after such a wide exploration? In the last chapter, he sums it up this way: If you explore depression seriously,you won’t necessarily get coherent advice.… More likely you’ll hear cacophony and contradiction, one voice beckoning you this way and another that way. But you shouldn’t be afraid of complexity. We’re pretty complicated creatures, no more so than when in the throes of an emotional state that colors all of our experience. And among all those voices, chances are good that sooner or later you will hear something that hits home, reaches down to you and lifts you out of your darkness.Greenberg follows this conclusion with a little advice of his own: As we explore depression (what it means for us and what it has meant for others), we must be careful about swallowing too quickly the antidepressant medications that are so often the first thing we find in our exploration. Greenberg backs this up throughout the book by showing the way that hype and limited perspective surround these medications. The medications are oversold by a pharmaceutical industry bent on making profits through marginally effective lifestyle drugs, and the drugs are discovered and researched through an empirical reductionism that too easily becomes an ideology of brain over mind (and most everything else).That does not mean that the medications may not be helpful for some people in some situations. It just means that we should be circumspect about what that “helpfulness” means before we buy into the idea of having a mental disease. And we should be imaginatively open to alternative possibilities. This imaginative process is invaluable because it not only shows us different ways to understand our sorrows and misfortunes, it also shows us different ways to make sense of who we are and different possibilities going forward.For example, if I understand my depression as the result of a broken brain, or an unresolved childhood grief, or the result of white, capitalist, heteronormative patriarchy run amok, it makes a difference. It affects not only how I understand my history and my present, but also what I do in the future, whom I hang out with, and what practices and rituals I get involved with.If I go with the broken brain narrative, I’ll see myself as having a psychiatric disability: I may apply for benefits; hang out with doctors, pharmacists, and other patients; and spend a great deal of time talking and thinking about my diagnosis and my neurotransmitters. If I go with the unresolved grief narrative, I’ll find a therapist or a support group and talk over the slings and arrows of my past, discussing how I can leave the past behind and stop repeating the most damaging patterns that have emerged with my significant others. And if I choose the political narrative, I may join an activist group, move to a cooperative housing community, or get involved in politics. And these three options only scratch the surface of the multiple possibilities for understanding and responding to depression. There are also perspectives centered on the family, interpersonal relations, yoga and meditation, spirituality, religious practices, and creative practices, just to name a few.Greenberg gives us the background needed to understand this flexibility. One place where I would like to supplement his meditation on the interpretations of depression, however, is on the question of “the truth.” At times Greenberg seems to be overly concerned about this question. At these points in the book, he seems to fall into a commonsense view of science as capable of providing an objective truth that is independent of human perspective and values. With this view, once we know the “truth,” we can let go of other knowledge formations, labeling them as “myth” or “superstition” or “ideology.” That would be nice with regard to depression, because if we had the truth (say, that depression is a disease like diabetes), we could let go of the other options. But recent scholarship in science studies has moved past a sharp dichotomy between truth and myth. Science studies scholars now believe that the real world and human perspectives—which is another way of saying objective and subjective, nature and culture, material and semiotic, facts and values—contribute to meaning-making by intertwining and interacting. The worldviews that humans hold and act on are determined partly by the metaphors, linguistic distinctions, and cultural preferences through which we approach the world, and partly by the world itself—in its active capacity to accommodate or resist different framings. This science studies insight means that there is not “one truth,” nor do we live in an “anything goes” world of free play. It means that there are multiple ways of understanding the world, which will result in multiple ways of being in the world. Each way says something true (and something mythical) about the world, and each has advantages and disadvantages for organizing a way of life.If we apply this science studies work to depression, we see that the question about the many perspectives on depression is not so much which one is true, but rather, what will be the lived experience of inhabiting the many different truths possible. What kind of narrative identity will I create for myself if I adopt truth option A, B, C, etc., or a hybrid combination of several truth options? From this science studies perspective, theologians, neuroscientists, psychoanalysts, cognitive therapists, political activists, and creative artists all have value; they all touch the reality of depression.One of the fascinating findings of depression research is that outcome studies tend to support this science studies perspective. Outcome studies show over and over again that the many different therapeutic ways of approaching depression are similarly effective. And, though medications are not usually included in these studies, it seems to be equally relevant for medications as well. For all of these treatments, the human qualities of the healer and the expectations of the healed are more important than the specific interventions. In other words, science shows that multiple approaches to depression can be effective. This means that people have multiple options. They do not have to figure out which narrative about depression is true. Instead they can spend more time figuring out which is the best fit for them. Each intervention is better at some things than others, so it is unlikely that a single intervention will be more effective for everything. And even if it were, if a magical substance, soma, appeared that took everyone to a higher plain in all areas of life, that does not mean everyone would have to (or want to) take it. Taking soma would still be a personal and cultural choice rather than a medical necessity, and there might be good reasons to say no to such a drug.I doubt that Greenberg would disagree with these last couple of paragraphs. Indeed, he reviews the outcome studies I just cited in detail. My guess is that the science studies perspective of multiple truths (and therefore multiple options) is more or less a default position for him as well. But it does seem that with a little help from science studies, we can hold on to this multiplicity a little more clearly. The advantage of doing so is that in the face of a cacophony of ways to understand depression, we can spend less time asking, “Which is true?” and more time in the subjunctive mood of possibilities, asking, “Which way or combination of ways might be right for me in my particular situation?”",

There have been few reported cases. The language switch typically occurs postoperatively and spontaneously resolves after a short period of time. The primary cause of this switching remains unclear. There is speculation about the involvement of anesthesia, but its specific influence remains unclear. Case presentation A 17-year-old Dutch Caucasian male lost the ability to understand and speak Dutch for 24 hours after an orthopedic surgery, combined with a brief confused state including disorientation of place and the inability to recognize his parents. During the period, he communicated in English, which he had learned during school classes but had never spoken outside of school. Further follow-up, including neuropsychological examination, revealed no indication of cognitive impairment. Conclusions The exact pathophysiology of foreign language syndrome remains unclear, most specifically whether it is a syndrome of its own or a phenotype of emergence delirium. There is still much to be learned, and further research is needed.",

However, a robust neural system need not be a rigid circuit. Neuroplasticity enables appropriate adaptations to frequent or chronic disturbances that initiate active modifications in respiratory control such as weight gain or loss, altitude exposure or injury [1]. Studies of respiratory plasticity are intended to reveal how and why experience or changing conditions influence the control of breathing. Further, the respiratory system provides an ideal model to explore fundamental mechanisms of neuroplasticity for at least two reasons. First, the respiratory neural control networks produce a spontaneous rhythmic and quantifiable motor output under a wide range of in vivo and in vitro conditions. Second, clear functional significance can be ascribed to respiratory motor output: it represents breathing. Many influential models of neuroplasticity (e.g., hippocampal long-term potentiation; [2,3]) lack these advantages.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Most pleasures have been condemned at some time and many laws have attempted to prohibit supposedly harmful behavior. Evolution has not collaborated perhaps because addictive behaviors, associated with reward and pleasure circuits/centers in the brain, are important for survival. Withdrawal symptoms are treatable with nicotine replacement therapy. Pleasure, is a harder problem to tackle and is associated with rituals, the senses and affect regulation and may be a major culprit in relapse. Dopamine dysregulation may favor addiction and addiction may lead to dopamine dysregulation. Many psychiatric patients may have dopaminergic dysregulation and altered pleasure circuit function and are more prone to addiction, especially to nicotine, and probably harder to help. Objectives/aims A reflection on desire and pleasure in smokers in general and psychiatric patients and on possible strategies to overcome these difficulties. Methods 1) A review of philosophical, sociopolitical, biological and neuropsychiatric views of pleasure 2) Rating of smoking as a pleasure on a visual analog scale on first assessment of a smoking cessation program in a psychiatric hospital 3) Reflections on difficulties encountered in a smoking cessation program and possible strategies to overcome these Results and conclusions Treating addictions poses tremendous challenges since the very mechanisms nature disposed for survival, are those gone awry. Pleasure is identified as a major driving force behind addiction in tobaco smoking therefore should be specifically addressed in smoking cessation programs. Psychiatric patients who smoke tobaco are an especially difficult patient population and one of the contributing factors may be dopamine dysregulation/pleasure dysregulation.",

      "title": "Chronic, Unipolar, Treatment-Resistant Mania: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Chronic mania is variably defined but classically recognized as the presence of manic symptoms for more than 2 years without remission. The reported incidence ranges between 6–15% among all patients with bipolar disorders. Although it has been described in psychiatry literature for a long time, it has not yet found a place in current nosological systems Methods We present a 32-year-old single and unemployed man who is supported by his family and living with a sudden-onset, continuous illness of 12 years’ duration characterized by a resistant and markedly euphoric and expansive mood with grandiose delusions. Other features such as distractibility, pressured speech, racing thoughts and psychomotor disturbance remain significant but vary and are more responsive to medical interventions. Psychotic symptoms are largely confined to mood-congruent delusions, grandiose and religious, and are reported to have followed the mood disturbance from early on. There is no history of substance use, past psychiatric or medical illness, or head trauma and no evidence of a neurological cause on workup. This gentleman has been treated with a range of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics and two courses of ECT over the years. In the recent years, he has been on a combination of Clozapine, Valproate, and Pregabalin with relatively favorable but inadequate response and limited functional improvement. Results Chronic mania lasting for 12 years, in the absence of an organic cause, despite the use of a wide gamut of modern psychotropics, alone and in combination with ECT, and with adequate compliance is an exceptionally rare entity. It poses manifold challenges both in terms of diagnostic considerations and therapeutic approaches. The overlap of symptoms of mania, schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorders along with chronicity adds a particular layer of complexity. The hallmark of chronic mania is euphoric and expansive mood along with grandiose delusions and the presentation is relatively less centered on sleep disturbance, hypersexuality, and psychomotor agitation as compared to an acute manic episode. It is distinguished from schizophrenia spectrum disorders as it lacks flat or inappropriate affect, incongruent delusions and disorganized thought. Course of illness, prior mood episodes and family history are important in differentiating from a schizoaffective pattern of disease. Conclusion Unremitting mania of this duration is unique in its psychiatric morbidity and devastating in its impact on the individual in terms of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, physical health and safety. It also brings unprecedented stress on the family and other support systems.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

This type of unintended effect, often underestimated, generally results from a drug-induced homeostatic imbalance that persists after the drug has been discontinued.

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded.

      "abstract": "Enhancing brain activity and function is a very ancient practice which is usually accomplished by taking illegal drugs.Prescription medication is becoming more commonly used as a means of enhancing mood, and recently, it has become possible to modulate mood by applying magnetic (TMS) or electrical current to the brain (tDCS, implanted electrodes) or by training the brain to work at predetermined oscillations (neurofeedback).A summary of the available neuromodulation techniques will be presented associated with data from human subjects implanted with cortical and/or subcutaneous electrodes that demonstrate the potential for electrical neuro-enhancement. The neurobiology of mood and emotionMood can be defined as a relatively lasting emotional or affective state.Mood and emotion differ in that mood lasts longer than an emotion, is less specific, often less intense, and less likely to be triggered by a particular stimulus or event.Mood can be considered a normal physiological affective state generated by the brain.Mood disorders, a pathological emotional state, are disabling disturbances of mood or emotion.They most likely result from a failure to regulate mood (Johnstone et al, 2007).Major depression, for instance, can be described as a failure to regulate negative emotions.This is similar to fear, a physiological emotional state, and anxiety disorder, a pathological state, where a failure to regulate fear circuits leads to anxiety even though objective information about the outside world may indicate that the situation is not dangerous (LeDoux, 2003).Major depression is usually characterized by persistent mood states such as",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as “long Covid,” is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term. Although the mechanisms to neuropsychiatric complications is still under study, the better understanding will not only augment screening of at-risk individuals but also help in prevention and management of these neuropsychiatric complications.",

Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consumption of alcohol excessively causes dependence and leads to psychological discomfort. Motivation to drink is influenced by a variety of neurobiological and environmental variables. The proclivity of an individual to imbibe is thought to reflect a balance between alcohol&rsquo;s positive reinforcing (i.e., rewarding) effects, such as euphoria and anxiety reduction (i.e., anxiolysis), and the drug&rsquo;s aversive effects, which are typically associated with negative consequences of alcohol consumption (e.g., hangover or withdrawal symptoms). Neuroadaptive alterations caused by continuous alcohol use and abuse (such as tolerance and physiological dependence) are regarded to be critical in the shift from regulated alcohol use to more frequent and excessive, uncontrollable drinking which induces cerebellar degeneration considered as common type of acquired toxic ataxia. Excessive use leads to degeneration of the midline cerebellum. Progressive trunk and gait ataxia is characteristic, with little involvement of upper limbs, eyes or speech (a corollary of relative cerebellar hemispheric sparing). Abrupt termination of alcohol use after a period of heavy drinking may result in alcohol withdrawal seizures. Generalized tonic&ndash;clonic seizures are the most common and severe form of seizure in this conditions. Current case report presents complaints of astasia and slurred speech with few episodes of seizures. The diagnosis indicated Mild cerebellar atrophy.

      "title": "Evaluation of Syncope in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Syncope is defined as a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone and should be differentiated from other states of altered consciousness such as cardiac arrest, coma, narcolepsy, seizures, dizziness, and vertigo. Although multiple studies have focused on the diagnostic workup and on the prognosis of patients with syncope,1-5 data on the evaluation and outcome of elderly patients are only recently being reported.6, 7 Establishing a cause of syncope is frequently difficult. There are at least three possible reasons for the inability to define a cause of syncope. One, abnormalities causing syncope are frequently episodic or isolated events and may not be found at initial evaluation. Two, the diagnostic criteria for causes of syncope may be too stringent, leading to underdiagnosis. Three, many patients evaluated after the syncopal event may not recall the details surrounding their episode. If witnesses are not present, valuable observations are lost and the cause of syncope may not be apparent. Additionally, the evaluation of syncope in the elderly is especially more difficult because the elderly often have multiple coexisting diseases, maybe taking multiple medications, and have age-related physiologic changes that can predispose to syncope. Elderly noninstitutionalized patients have on the average 3.5 chronic diseases8 including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disorders, all of which can predispose to syncope. Older patients are reported to take three times as many drugs as the general population,9 and many of these medications may make persons susceptible to syncope. Additionally, age-related physiologic changes may alter the normal homeostatic mechanisms maintaining blood pressure and cerebral blood flow. Baroreceptor sensitivity decreases with age and the heart rate increase in response to upright posture, exercise, cough, and hypoxia may be blunted.10, 11 Furthermore, aging results in a diminished ability of the kidneys to conserve sodium when intake is restricted and plasma renin and aldosterone responses may be diminished in the elderly, leading to difficulties in maintaining extracellular fluid balance.12 As previously emphasized,13 multiple pathologic processes together may result in syncope in the elderly and occasionally it may be difficult to specifically assign a single entity as its cause. We have recently analyzed the data from our prospective syncope study in order to compare the diagnosis and prognosis of 210 elderly patients (mean age, 71 years; range, 60 to 90 years) to 190 younger patients (mean age, 39 years; range, 14 to 59 years).6 Patients in this study were accrued from the inpatient and outpatient services of the Presbyterian-University Hospital, Pittsburgh, from April 1981 through September 1983 and all underwent a standardized diagnostic evaluation.2, 6 In our elderly patients, as noted in Table 1, initial history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were useful in assigning a diagnosis in the majority of the patients in whom a cause could be found. Furthermore, in the elderly, diagnosis assigned by electroencephalogram, carotid massage, cardiac catheterization, cerebral angiogram, and stress test were suggested by findings on the initial history and physical examination. These results in the elderly are similar to previous studies which have shown that a careful initial history and physical examination is the most important step in the evaluation of patients with syncope.1-3 Previous studies, however, have also shown that in a substantial number of patients a cause of syncope cannot be established after the initial history, physical examination, and EKG. Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring has assumed a central role in the evaluation of this group of patients. Although in our study6 arrhythmias were more frequently diagnosed, and prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring more often led to a diagnosis in the elderly, there are many issues regarding the use of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring that are not resolved. First, there is poor correlation between symptoms found during monitoring and concurrent electrocardiographic findings.14-16 Symptoms of dizziness or syncope during monitoring occur in 29 to 42% of patients.14-16 We have reported that a rhythm disturbance could not be identified during 75% of symptomatic periods.15 Arrhythmias may be excluded as a cause if the patient has syncope during monitoring, but no concurrent rhythm disturbance. However, most patients do not have syncope during monitoring. Therefore, presumptions regarding the cause of syncope based on asymptomatic findings are frequently necessary because of the prognostic importance and sporadic nature of the arrhythmias. However, high prevalenece of cardiac arrhythmias has been reported in asymptomatic elderly patients. Therefore, in elderly patients with syncope, it has been difficult to be certain which arrhythmias should be considered significant indicators for a potential cause of loss of consciousness. Validation of the criteria used by different investigators will be needed with long-term follow-up using recurrence of symptoms and mortality as endpoints. Second, the optimal duration of electrocardiographic monitoring has not been determined. One study suggested that patients should be continuously monitored until the symptoms recur.17 This approach is impractical and not cost-effective. We are currently evaluating the optimal duration of monitoring in patients with syncope. Third, the yield of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring is variable, showing transient arrhythmias as a potential cause of syncope in 10 to 64% of patients.18-23 Clinical predictors are needed to help identify patients more likely to have diagnostic findings. Because of the limitations of prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring, electrophysiologic studies have been advocated for use in the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope.24 These studies, however, consist of invasive and expensive diagnostic tests which are useful in the evaluation of very selected subgroups of patients with syncope, such as patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause “who have underlying organic heart disease. These tests may not be practical in many elderly patients who are frail, have multiple chronic medical illnesses, and who may not be able to undergo invasive diagnostic testing. A large number of abnormalities are reported on electrophysiologic studies but the diagnostic importance of many of these in terms of a cause of syncope is not well established. Although sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia, markedly prolonged H-V interval (greater than 80 m), and markedly prolonged sinus node recovery time are important findings in patients with unexplained syncope, the clinical significance of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, mildly prolonged H-V interval or sinus node recovery time, and induction of supraventricular tachycardia is not clear. Morbidity and mortality from syncope in the elderly may be different than the young. Injury after a fall in the elderly may have important ramifications in terms of the medical and psychological well-being of the elderly. Although there are no prior studies regarding injury due to syncope, studies on falls in the elderly reveal a higher incidence of bone fractures with advancing age.25 Approximately one-third of our patients had an injury due to a fall, but falls resulted in major trauma more frequently in the elderly. Bone fractures may be more likely to occur in the elderly because of their higher prevalence of osteoporosis. In addition, if premonitory symptoms are present, younger patients may be able to react more quickly and assume a supine or sitting position to avoid a severe injury. The mortality in our study was higher in the elderly as a reflection of deaths due to many underlying illnesses such as malignancies and pneumonia.6 In addition, more deaths in the elderly resulted from cardiovascular diseases such as chronic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular disease. Elderly patients in our study also had a higher incidence of sudden death. A multivariate analysis of our data6 revealed that patients with a cardiovascular cause of syncope are at exceedingly high risk of mortality and sudden death regardless of age. In patients with a noncardiovascular cause of syncope or syncope of unknown origin, older age, a history of congestive heart failure, and male sex were important risk factors for mortality and sudden death. Recent studies on syncope in conjunction with our study in the elderly6 provide a framework for the evaluation of elderly patients with syncope. These studies show that a careful history and physical examination will help establish many of the causes of syncope and may suggest many of the cardiac or non-cardiac causes that require further testing for definitive diagnosis. An EKG and electrocradiographic monitoring should be done in patients in whom a cause is not found on initial history and physical examination. In selected patients with recurrent syncope of unknown cause who have organic heart disease, electrophysiologic studies may provide evidence for possible cause of syncope, but further studies are needed to define the risk and benefit of this test in elderly patients. Other diagnostic tests should be used selectively. Our studies have shown that nongoal-directed use of head computed tomography scan, electroencephalogram, and glucose tolerance test establish few if any causes of syncope.1, 2, 6 Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality than the young. A systematic and meticulous evaluation for cause of syncope in the elderly is needed in the hope of decreasing recurrences, morbidity, and the incidence of sudden death.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico. Conclusiones. el consumo de PBC se cine a patrones de conducta muy variables pero siempre condicionadas a estimulos internos y externos, con poca o ninguna relacion con la euforia, sugiriendo un fenomeno asociado a la neurobiologia del aprendizaje",

      "abstract": "Seizures may herald, complicate, or become persistent sequellae of acute neurologic disorders such as acute cerebrovascular insult (stroke or hemorrhage), bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis, and head trauma. The occurrence of seizures in patients with primary neurological insults invariably adds an additional layer of complexity to patient management. For example, diminished arousal after generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus (SE) may put a patient at risk for aspiration or hypoxia and may warrant airway protection via intubation and mechanical ventilation. Many patients will develop aspiration pneumonia. Phasic and substantial increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) during generalized tonic clonic seizures may lead to brain herniation in the setting of an existing mass lesion such as an acute stroke, hemorrhage, or brain tumor. Increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), hypoxemia, and metabolic or respiratory acidosis may accompany generalized tonic-clonic seizures and complicate the management of patients with acute stroke, sepsis, cardiac ischemia, or pulmonary edema Finally, systemic toxicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be encountered and cause medical complications such as cardiac dysrhythmia, hypotension, the Stevens—Johnson syndrome, other hypersensitivity reactions, and hepatic failure. Some of these complications may be life threatening even if the underlying neurologic event is not. It is important for the clinician, whether in the outpatient, hospital ward, or Emergency Department setting, to remember that a first-time seizure may herald a potentially significant and even disastrous neurologic event. This chapter will focus on the etiologic, diagnostic, and treatment implications of seizures in several acute neurologic disorders such as arterial and venous cerebral infarcts, intracerebral hemorrhage, including hypertensive, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, and brain trauma.",

The adults had a lower but statistically significant degree of comorbidity, primarily with substance use disorder.

Although not frequently reported, they might significantly affect the lives of people with SUD. For instance, chorea, tics, and stereotypies are hyperkinetic movements reported in people taking amphetamines. Symptoms usually manifest within the first hours of drug use, subsiding thereafter. In some patients, however, movement disorders can have a chronic course, persisting even after the end of amphetamine misuse.

      "abstract": "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is a unique drug, sharing properties of hallucinogens and stimulants. The acute effects of empathy, euphoria, and excitement for which it is used recreationally can make it overwhelmingly distracting for the user in the context of driving. This review considers the chemistry, synthesis, analysis, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and documented effects of MDMA on cognitive and psychomotor skills important to driving. Laboratory studies show that users do experience cognitive impairments, and may also act more impulsively while under the influence of the drug's sympathomimetic effects. Psychomotor impairment may occur with elevated doses or after repeated administration, and residual psychomotor impairment during the \"coming-down\" phase may be compounded by fatigue, dehydration, combined drug use, or other confounding factors. There is growing anecdotal information providing evidence of MDMA-impaired driving, and it is evident that many users recognize and attempt to mitigate the effects by delaying driving until the acute affects have dissipated. The drug inevitably may affect a subject's judgment and ability to properly assess their fitness to drive also. Blood concentrations in MDMA-impaired drivers suggest that this impairment can be caused by normal patterns of recreational use, and MDMA use should be considered inconsistent with safe driving immediately following ingestion, and for up to a day or longer following use.",

It also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders. Asthma and these psychological states and traits may mutually potentiate each other through direct psychophysiological mediation, nonadherence to medical regimen, exposure to asthma triggers, and inaccuracy of asthma symptom perception. Defensiveness is associated with inaccurate perception of airway resistance and stress-related bronchoconstriction. Asthma education programs that teach about the nature of the disease, medications, and trigger avoidance tend to reduce asthma morbidity. Other promising psychological interventions as adjuncts to medical treatment include training in symptom perception, stress management, hypnosis, yoga, and several biofeedback procedures.",

      "title": "Nasal dilator for management of sleep apnea",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Sleep disorders are commonly caused by nasal obstruction. Fatigue, when present in those with nasal problems and otherwise unexplained, is often considered secondary to poor or inadequate sleep.‘,’ Nasal obstruction itself is associated with many systemic reflexes, including changes in intrathoracic pressure, pulse, and blood pressure.3 Reports during the 19th century proposed a nasal reflex rather than sleep disturbance as the origin of fatigue in many patients with nasal obstruction. The following case describes fatigue associated with nasal obstruction promptly relieved by a nasal dilator and therefore unrelated to sleep abnormalities. The patient was a 4%year-old man with a lo-year history of unexplained persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest. The fatigue was especially pronounced on awakening but continued throughout the day. It was not associated with pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, headache, or known sleep disturbance. Aside from fatigue, symptoms were limited to nasal congestion especially on the left side and a “heavy-headedness” sensation in the head. Four comprehensive examinations over the 10 symptomatic years were without relevant findings. Symptoms of nasal congestion and a cyst in the left maxillary sinus noted on a sinus roentgenogram prompted the following procedures: creation of antral windows, removal of the maxillary cyst, nasal septum reconstruction, and partial resection of the inferior turbinates; all with no effect on the fatigue. Approximately 8 years after the onset of fatigue, the patient noted that relief could be obtained by pressing up the left external nares. This observation suggested dysfunction of the nasal valve and prompted reconstruction using cartilage grafts, a procedure that was unsuccessful in relieving his inadequate air flow or his fatigue. At the suggestion of a consultant he purchased a nasal dilator for the left anterior nares and obtained almost immediate relief of the fatigue. Fatigue consistently returned within 15 minutes if the dilator was removed and promptly resolved when reinserted, indicating the lack of any association with sleep. Systemic reactions to nasal disease are well documented in the medical literature but fatigue, when associated with nasal obstruction, is generally considered secondary to sleep abnormalities. Before the clear association of nasal obstruction and sleep abnormalities was known, reports in the older literature postulated a “nasal reflex” to explain the resolution of fatigue and a number of other significant complaints after nasal surgery or cauterization. In 1898, Wells reported cases of neurological and mental manifestations of nasal disease associated with extraordinary fatigue.* At the time of the linkage of nasal symptoms with fatigue and inability to concentrate was well accepted enough to generate the term “aprosexia nasalis.” More recent research documents profound changes in blood pressure, pulse, and respiration with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, nasal stimulation is associated with vasoconstruction, laryngeal construction, and bronchoconstriction. Cottle maintained that air currents stimulating the nasal mucosa effect remote organs by nerve pathways and may be responsible for a state of ill health. Nasal valve movements, he also noted, were largely responsible for the “rest” obtained by the body during sleeps5 This case report suggests that unilateral nasal obstruction may be responsible for fatigue independent of any effect it might have on sleep.",

      "abstract": "Seizures are either focal (partial) or generalized in onset (Table I).1 The manifestation of the seizure is related to the area of the brain involved in the initial electrical seizure discharge. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

      "title": "Overview of Anxiety and the Anxiety Disorders",
      "abstract": "Anxiety can be a confusing term because it can have several different meanings and apply to different experiences and behaviors. According to Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary [1], anxiety is a vague, uneasy feeling of discomfort or dread accompanied by an autonomic (self-controlling) response. Anxiety alerts individuals to changes, both within them and in the world around them, as part of an internal signal system [2]. Anxiety consists of a range of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and is influenced by biological, psychological, and genetic factors [3]. Anxiety is a normal but at times unpleasant emotion. The subjective experience of anxiety differs, but familiar presentations include symptoms such as apprehension, uneasiness, “butterflies in the stomach,” anticipation, and dread. Objective behavioral manifestations include looking strained and tense, hypervigilance, shakiness, muscle tension, sweaty palms, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, restlessness, and avoidance. Equivalent anxiety experiences may be described as nervousness, tension, worry, restlessness, irritability, agitation, and somatization [4]. Table 1.1 lists common subjective and objective symptoms and descriptors associated with various states of anxiety [2]. Although primary care practitioners are well aware of the many and varied presentations of anxiety symptoms and signs, they can present as true diagnostic dilemmas at times. Individuals experience anxiety as a normal emotion at different times in their lives, and the source may be known, unknown, or nonspecific. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and can help one to cope. Anxiety involves anticipating future danger, and the response can actually help us to avoid potential danger—the “fight or flight” response. Triggers for the anxiety response include psychological threats, the unexpected, novelty, social/performance situations, cognitive mechanisms, and conditioned associative memories [4].",

      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

They normally last between 30sec and 2min. The effect upon the individual will depend on the area and extent of the brain involved.

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

Signs of central nervous system toxicity include tremors, agitation, and twitching, often followed by dizziness, drowsiness, sedation, and unsteady gait. Methemoglobinemia is a rare, but potentially serious complication of the administration of many drugs, most commonly due to excess accumulated metabolites of certain local anesthetics, notably, overdoses of prilocaine and benzocaine. Clinical symptoms of this disorder vary with blood levels of methemoglobin. Potential interactions can occur between vasoconstrictors and other drugs with adrenergic activity. These interactions affect heart rate and blood pressure. There are three common clinical scenarios where local anesthetic administration fails to provide adequate anesthesia: Infiltration into inflamed tissues or near painful regions, Inability to obtain a mandibular block, and Lip is numb, but tooth is not.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

Several efforts have been guided by the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and have included exposure of animals to stressful stimulation. Other animal models have involved prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation or drugs that disrupt neuronal development, followed by stress during adolescence or in early adulthood to unmask vulnerabilities. Neonatal hippocampal lesions have been employed in other animal models of schizophrenia. Another profitable approach has been to selectively breed laboratory mice or rats for their susceptibility to dopaminergic drugs. A more recent approach has been to develop laboratory mice with targeted alterations in risk genes for schizophrenia that were previously identified in clinical studies. In many cases, the effects of these risk genes are unmasked by exposure of animals to stressful stimulation during specific stages of postnatal development.",

In other instances, especially when the discharges are more atypical, the psychic disturbances may take on the character of either a simple worsening of behavior or of a confusional state with agitation and delirium, or of a stuporous state. The temporal lobe statuses, which are much more rare, manifest themselves either as a succession of psychomotor attacks, or as protracted confusional or confusooneiric episodes.

      "abstract": "Summary Overtraining, a decrease in performance despite training that does not disappear after 2 weeks of relative rest, accompanied by symptoms like fatigue, anorexia, and muscle and joint pain, mood changes and feeling burnt out or stale is a frequent syndrome in endurance athletes. It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "abstract": "Death from the misuse of alcohol and barbiturates is frequently encountered in most medical examiner/coroner offices. The cause of death is often quite apparent from the pathological and toxicological findings; however, the manner of death often gives the examining official some difficulty. The usual dilemma is to unravel whether the dead individual intentionally took the lethal combination in order to cause his/her own death or whether the combination was unintentionally ingested without awareness of the potentially lethal combination. The manner of death in these cases is either suicidal, accidental, or undetermined. A case is presented in which alcohol and barbiturates are the causes of death, but the manner of death is somewhat unusual in that it was administered by a second party with premeditation, deliberation, and intent to kill.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

      "title": "Testing of visceral sensitivity.",
      "abstract": "Under normal circumstances most of the visceral input to the central nervous system is not perceived consciously. Visceral hypersensitivity associated with altered reflex activity seems to be a common pathophysiological mechanism in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Investigation of visceral sensitivity in humans is based on distension tests using barostat, or tensostat more recently. Tensostat may allow better standardization of distending stimuli, regardless of the capacity or compliance of the organ being tested. Other techniques include transmucosal electrical nerve stimulation, and chemical or thermal stimulation. Measurement of the responses to gut stimuli is based on the evaluation of conscious perception or objective responses, such as reflex activity or central processes. Recently, the assessment of the central responses has become available due to a variety of new brain imaging techniques. Several factors are thought to influence the results of visceral sensitivity studies: age, gender, physiological factors (postprandial testing) as well as psychological factors (stress, hypnosis, hypervigilance phenomenon). Technical conditions for performing tests like distension protocols may considerably affect the perception of sensory thresholds. Various mediators and pharmacological agents, in particular those acting on serotonin receptors, affect the sensory function of the gastrointestinal tract, and some of them have therapeutic potential in the treatment of visceral hypersensitivity.",

Monoaminergic neurotransmitter terminals are affected by METH intake. METH structure is very similar to amphetamine, a drug used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METH is taken in various modes, such as smoking, swallowing, snorting, injecting powder, etc. Dopamine levels, serotonin levels, and norepinephrine levels are increased due to METH uptake, leading to extremely strong euphoric effects. This dopamine surge causes the brain to repeatedly take the drug and is responsible for addiction. As a short-term effect, METH causes increased wakefulness and physical activity, decreased appetite, faster breathing, rapid and/or irregular heartbeat, increased blood pressure, and body temperature. METH overdose causes hyperthermia and convolution, which can lead to death if not treated. METH also causes irreversible brain damage. Amphetamine psychosis, dementia-like symptoms, increased anti-social behaviour, and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases are the long-term neurological effects of METH use.",

      "abstract": "Syndrome of dementia, which appears as a result of deterioration of brain structure that is caused by different factors, together with syndrome of psychomotor restlessness, represents one of the most common psychiatric conditions at patients of the geriatric population (older than 75 years). Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’.

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Among well-known side effects such as dizziness, nausea, headache and diplopia medical treatment of epilepsy may cause side effects on cognition, mood and behavior. In special constellations this can profoundly affect compliance with the medication as well as quality of life. Some patients are more vulnerable to side effects than others. Side effects can have profound impact on the development and future life of a patient. Some antiepileptic drugs (e.g. topiramate, zonisamide) show a more severe side effect profile than others (e.g. lamotrigine, levetiracetam). Thus, in the treatment of epilepsy, it is crucial to consider such possible side effects – especially in the beginning of or while changing the medical treatment. Specific neuropsychological examinations can monitor side effects on cognitive functions like concentration, memory or speech function. If this is not possible in an ambulant setting, specific screening instruments and repeated and precise interviews of patients and/or relatives can help to discover potential side effects. Because most side effects can be reversible, dosage modification or drug replacement is required as soon as incompatibilities are discovered.",

      "abstract": "초록·키워드 목차 오류제보하기 Muzong in Liao Dynasty suffered from borderline personality disorder due to various negative environmental factors during the growth process and after the emperor\"s ascension, and schizophrenia was more pronounced in his later years in office. Mokjong was so capricious that he got angry or brutally slaughtered the Valets (近侍). In addition, drinking too much and sleeping resulted in more days of not attending the meeting, and officials were appointed in a drunken state. As a result, the political situation became unstable due to the lack of administrative efficiency and the loss of national territory by passive response in foreign relations. He shows a psychopathic phenomenon called borderline personality disorder. A person with borderline personality disorder experiences a sense of confusion about himself, showing various protruding behaviors that are hard to predict because stable self-image has not been established. He was self-indulgent and self-indulgent, war, and sexual dysfunction, depending on alcohol, but he was more drunk and destroyed himself in a vicious cycle of shame and guilt caused by moral anxiety. Eventually, he is killed by people who serves close (近侍) who were subject to murder. As such, the impact of a human growth process on an individual is absolute. Abnormal behavior and mental disorder are the products of such painful and unhappy past experiences, as well as the causes that make life painful and unhappy. This could bring misfortune to society and the nation, not only to the parties but also to their families and people around them. In particular, it was inevitable that the absolute monarch of feudal society would fall in national power and endanger the country, as he was acting strangely due to psychological disorder, wrong decision-making, and disorderly conduct, so that his subjects could not control the monarch. #요 목종 #수왕 #근시 살해 #정신분석 #경계선성격장애 #遼 穆宗 #睡王 #近侍殺害 #情神分析 #境界線性格障礙 #Muzong emperor in Liao Dynasty #sleeping king #slaughter of Valets #psychoanalysis #borderline personality disorder Ⅰ. 머리말Ⅱ. 목종의 가계도 및 그 생애Ⅲ. 목종의 이상행동과 그 원인Ⅳ. 맺음말참고문헌Abstract",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is commonly defined as the subjective report of difficulty in initially falling asleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep (long or multiple awakenings during the sleep period), or awakening too early with the inability to go back to sleep. In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "title": "Your Loved One Has Migraines",
      "abstract": "There are few things more distressing than seeing your loved one in pain. Migraine, which causes repeated attacks of severe head pain associated with other disabling symptoms, affects not only the person who has it but also impacts the people close to them. It is not just a headache. Migraine produces episodes of moderate to severe head pain that is often throbbing, and generally accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise, nausea and/or vomiting, and is worsened with movement or routine activity. There may be other symptoms, such as sensitivity to odors, inability to concentrate, trouble producing speech, numbness, balance problems, weakness, double vision, and dizziness. About 25% of patients with migraine experience an aura of visual symptoms or other neurologic symptoms, usually occurring prior to their headache pain. The headaches usually last several hours and sometimes persist for days. Some patients identify triggers, such as food triggers, alcohol, food additives, certain odors, and artificial sweeteners. Patients with migraine have a genetic predisposition to having migraines, and most have a family history of migraine. The migraine brain is “sensitive” and reacts to things that do not generally bother people who do not have migraine. The migraine brain also hates change. Thus, stress or let-down from stress, change in sleep pattern (too much, too little, changing sleep onset or awakening time), heat, bright lights, loud noises, missing meals, and dehydration may provoke migraines as well. Migraines often occur with menstrual periods in women and worsen around menopause when hormones are fluctuating. Weather changes are often blamed but the scientific data supporting this are inconsistent. The most common reason that migraines worsen over time is overuse of symptomatic medications, which is called medication overuse headache. Over-the-counter as well as prescription medications can produce this condition, which turns episodic migraine into headaches that become more frequent and ultimately become daily. Even seemingly “safe” medications such as acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory medications and caffeine-containing compounds can cause worsening of migraines over time. It is important to limit symptomatic medication use (all medications combined if there is more than one medication used) to twice weekly. If someone requires symptomatic more often than twice a week, their preventive medication is not optimized. Stressful life events and chronic internalized stress are other common causes of worsening migraine. The medical profession used to talk about a “migraine personality” occurring in type A, driven, controlling, detail-oriented people. This is not true; anyone can have migraine. As migraine is episodic, often severe, and interferes with activities, many people with migraine have anxiety related to the fear of future migraines. Having frequent pain and feeling like a burden to one's family also leads to depression. Sometimes the loved ones wonder if patients with migraine are using their headaches to be manipulative missing school, not attending events, requiring help for daily tasks. This is generally not the case but some people with frequent headaches (particularly those overusing symptomatic medications) develop pain behaviors and assume a “sick role.” Well-meaning relatives and friends may sometimes worsen this, catering to all the needs of their loved one and focusing the majority of interactions on their pain. This is draining on loved ones as well as patients and may create a downward spiral of deteriorating relationships and social withdrawal. Patients with migraine do not require 24 hour care or observation (even in the hospital). It is important for people with severe migraines to keep living life, getting out of bed and doing something every day, and emphasizing what they CAN do, rather than what they CANNOT do every day. Exercise helps, and need not be vigorous walking, light yoga, tai chi, pilates, and water exercise are all good options. Patients are encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests, even if they don't feel well. Children should go to school. Cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback are helpful. Anxiety is best addressed by these methods combined with counseling, as opposed to medications. Counseling and antidepressants are helpful to treat depression; while patients with depression are more likely to have migraine and vice versa, improvement of pain often helps mood. Each patient needs to take charge of their own care, including managing (and knowing) their own medications, speaking for themselves at office visits, sending and responding to their own medical office communications, and contacting the office themselves (unless the circumstances are dire). That said, others may want to be on the lookout for medication overuse, hiding or hoarding medications. Migraine is inherently a treatable problem. Successful treatment of frequent migraines requires more than pills and procedures, although they help substantially. Other aspects of care include physical therapy, exercise, counseling and mental health care, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle and happy living. Realistic expectations are important: we are aiming for a reduction in migraine frequency, with infrequent migraines that are effectively treated with symptomatic medications when they occur.",

      "title": "ALCOHOLIC EPILEPSY.",
      "abstract": "The term \"alcoholic epilepsy\" is comparatively new in medicine and describes a class of inebriates who have convulsive symptoms resembling epilepsy. Some writers call it a form of delirium tremens and acute alcoholism; others consider it a distinct epilepsy due to the toxic action of alcohol on the brain centers. In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink. When this craving was neutralized by treatment, the convulsion returned. When spirits were",

      "title": "Acute and Long-Term Effects of Cannabis Use: A Review",
      "abstract": "Cannabis remains the most commonly used and trafficked illicit drug in the world. Its use is largely concentrated among young people (15- to 34-year-olds). There is a variety of cannabis use patterns, ranging from experimental use to dependent use. Men are more likely than women to report both early initiation and frequent use of cannabis. Due to the high prevalence of cannabis use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. A range of acute and chronic health problems associated with cannabis use has been identified. Cannabis can frequently have negative effects in its users, which may be amplified by certain demographic and/or psychosocial factors. Acute adverse effects include hyperemesis syndrome, impaired coordination and performance, anxiety, suicidal ideations/tendencies, and psychotic symptoms. Acute cannabis consumption is also associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially fatal collisions. Evidence indicates that frequent and prolonged use of cannabis can be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Chronic effects of cannabis use include mood disorders, exacerbation of psychotic disorders in vulnerable people, cannabis use disorders, withdrawal syndrome, neurocognitive impairments, cardiovascular and respiratory and other diseases. Keywords: Cannabis, marijuana, cannabinoids, dependence, addiction, THC, acute effects, long-term effects, and cannabis use disorders.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

The most common of these are general somatic or gastrointestinal distress, anxiety and agitation, sleep disturbance, akathisia, parkinsonism, paradoxical behavioral activation and mania. There are very few reports of withdrawal reactions following discontinuation of clomipramine since it has not been in use in the US until recently. 2 patients with withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of clomipramine are presented. A 45-year-old man had general somatic symptoms, including headache, myalgia, weakness, fatigue (flu-like syndrome) and nervousness and insomnia after clomipramine, 75 mg/d, had been discontinued abruptly. All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days. A 47-year-old woman presented mainly with severe insomnia, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness and tension after discontinuing a low dose of 25 mg/d of clomipramine. Symptoms disappeared after she started self-treatment with 50 mg/d of the drug. It is important to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from relapse of the primary psychiatric disorder.",

With some drug like cocaine, stroke appear to be the result of a direct effect. In young subjects without other risk factors provide persuasive evidence for causality . OPIATES: Heroine is the most abused opiate drug, which is administered by injection, by snorting or by smoking. Stroke affects heroin users by diverse mechanisms,. Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two. Decongestants and diet pills: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), an amphetamine – like drug, in decongestants and diet pills, induce acute hypertension, sever headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures and hemorrhagic stroke. Ephedrine and pseudo ephedrine are present in decongestants and bronchodilators and induce headache, tachyarrhythmia, hypertensive emergency, and hemorrhagic and occlusive stroke.

      "abstract": "Much anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep deprivation not only impairs performance, but also brings about other extraordinary effects like hallucinations. However, knowledge about how sleep deprivation may trigger hallucinations is limited. To qualitatively describe hallucinatory experiences during sleep deprivation 12 male military officers from the Norwegian Armed Forces who all had experienced at least one sleep loss-induced hallucinatory experience were recruited. Data were collected and analyzed by semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. This resulted in the identification of three distinct main themes: (1) Modalities, (2) circumstances/triggers and (3) reactions to hallucinations. Hallucinations were experienced in several modalities (visual, auditory and multi-modality), although visual hallucinations seemed to dominate. Typical reported circumstances/triggers were sleep loss, physical exhaustion, time-of-day, low calorie intake, mental exhaustion and lack of external stimuli (low sensory and social input, boring situations, and monotonous activity). Negative emotions were dominant during the hallucinatory episodes. Often some reasoning and checking on behalf of the officers were necessary to differentiate between real percepts and hallucinations. In some cases the hallucinations caused erroneous actions. Retrospectively, most officers viewed their hallucinatory experiences in light of positive emotions and several emphasized having learned something from them. The results are discussed in relation to the existing literature and suggestions for future studies are outlined.",

The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.",

      "abstract": "Summary Tolerance has been recognized for some time where chronic exposure to certain drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and opioids, is associated with apparent tachyphylaxis. When these drugs are stopped or progressively reduced as in ‘tapering’, withdrawal symptoms may result. Tolerance and the flip side of the coin, withdrawal, are the determinants of addiction. It is increasingly apparent that tolerance can occur acutely, even within the time span of a single anesthetic for a surgical procedure. Addiction is caused by agents, foreign to the body, that provoke adaptation by homeostatic biological processes. When these agents are withdrawn, the adaptive mechanisms, devoid of substrate, take time to diminish and produce symptoms recognizable under the term of ‘withdrawal’. Children may be exposed to these agents in different ways; in utero , as a result of substances that the mother ingests by enteral, parenteral or inhalational means that are transmitted to the infant via the placenta; as a result of an anesthetic for surgery; or as a result of sedation and analgesia administered to offset the stresses and trauma inherent from intensive care treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit. Additionally, anesthetic and intensive care staff are exposed to powerful and addictive drugs as part of everyday practice, not simply by overt access, but also by subliminal environmental exposure.",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a neurological syndrome with sustained muscle contractions producing an abnormal posture, and is usually secondary to central nervous system dysfunction. Dystonia is often classified by etiology, and may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological deficits or an identifiable structural or metabolic lesion. Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified. (Chapters 3 and 8). Secondary dystonia can be further classified into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Table 1).",

Ovlivňuje spánek a stravovací návyky, způsob vlastní percepce stejně jako vnímání okolního světa. Deprese není známkou osobní slabosti nebo stavem, kterého se můžeme zbavit pouhým přáním nebo zapojením vůle. Lidé trpící depresí se nemohou jednoduše \"sebrat\" a uvolnit se. Je typické, že depresivní poruchy se vyskytují v různých formách. Soubory příznaků mohou přetrvávat po týdny, měsíce až roky, pokud nejsou léčeny. Odpovídající léčba na druhou stranu může pomoci většině populace trpící depresí. Máme k dispozici různé druhy antidepresiv, včetně těch nejnovějších, jako jsou - inhibitory zpětného vychytávání serotoninu (SSRIs) - stejně jako tricyklická antidepresiva a inhibitory monoamino-oxidázy (MAOIs). SSRI podobně jako další novější léky, ovlivňující přenašeče nervových vzruchů - např. dopamin nebo noradrenalin - mají obecně méně nežádoucích účinků než tricyklická antidepresiva. Vhodně zvolená psychoterapie v kombinaci s vhodným antidepresivem může podstatně přispět ke zlepšení kvality života lidí trpících depresí.",

      "abstract": "While opioid dependence has more treatment agents available than other abused drugs, none are curative. They can, however, markedly diminish withdrawal symptoms and craving, and block opioid effects due to lapses.The most effective withdrawal method is substituting and tapering methadone or buprenorphine, α-2 Adrenergic agents can ameliorate untreated symptoms or substitute for agonists if not available. Shortening withdrawal by precipitating it with narcotic antagonists has been studied, but the methods are plagued by safety issues or persisting symptoms. Neither the withdrawal agents nor the methods are associated with better long-term outcome, which appears mostly related to post-detoxification treatment.Excluding those with short-term habits, the best outcome occurs with long-term maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine accompanied by appropriate psychosocial interventions. Those with strong external motivation may do well on the antagonist naltrexone. Currently, optimum duration of maintenance on either is unclear. Better agents are needed to impact the brain changes related to addiction.",

Insomnia is associated with a disturbance in one or more of the three systems that regulate sleep: homeostatic, circadian and arousal. A disturbance may result from genetic/dispositional issues, from acute life events, from habitual behaviors and attitudes, or from any combination of these three types of issues. A number of treatment methods have been developed that use behavior modification and cognitive restructuring to facilitate homeostatic and circadian mechanisms of sleep, and to reduce arousal during bedtime. These methods actively engage the patient to implement life style changes, attitudes and beliefs that promote sleep.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

Cyclothymic depressions include symptoms such as sadness, anhedonia, low energy, pessimism, poor concentration, and sleep and appetite changes resembling those observed in episodes of major depression. Cyclothymic hypomanic periods involve symptoms such as euphoria, high energy/activity, talkativeness, high self‐confidence and grandiosity, decreased sleep, and impulsive, reckless behaviors typically observed in mania. However, unlike major depression and mania, both types of cyclothymic mood episodes are of subsyndromal intensity and duration (two to three days on average). Cyclothymic disorder can present as predominantly depressed, predominantly hypomanic, or balanced with approximately equal proportions of high and low periods (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990).",

It is well known that dentists are subject to a variety of stress-related physical and emotional problems. In dental practice it may include the difficulties in managing anxious children, or dealing with neurotic, difficult or uncompliant adults. Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

      "title": "The Explosion of a New Designer Drug, Flakka",
      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

      "abstract": "The gustatory system is responsible for four basic taste experiences: salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. A fifth quality, called umami, has been postulated to describe the taste of monosodium glutamate and related compounds (Rolls et al., 1998). However, these taste bud-mediated sensations should not be confused with flavor sensations like coffee, chocolate, strawberry, lemon, steak sauce, barbeque sauce, etc., which are mediated via the olfactory system. During deglutition, volatiles from foodstuffs or drinks stimulate the olfactory receptors retronasally (i.e., through the nasopharynx), imparting such sensations. Additional components of flavor include texture, temperature, oral irritation, pungentness, and other somatosensory sensations. Although many of these interrelated components of flavor can be impaired or distorted following traumatic cranial nerve or brain injury, nasal or oral trauma, and surgical or medical therapies, such impairment is extremely rare. In general, most \"taste\" losses reflect damage to the olfactory system (see Chapters 22, 30, and 44).",

      "abstract": ". the stedman's medical dictionary gives a more comprehensive definition and defines it as the act or practice of ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition, as by lethal injection or the suspension of extraordinary medical treatment. 2 Before we dwell deeper into the subject it is important to understand a few medical terms namely the difference between brain dead (BD) and persistent vegetative state (PVs all accounts Aruna shanbaug has been in a PVs for the past thirty odd years. When she was strangled her brain was deprived of precious oxygen and blood leading to anoxic encephalopathy. Anoxic encephalopathy may also occur following other causes of cardiac and respiratory arrest. Most patients do not survive the initial anoxic insult to the brain, either their heart naturally stops after sometime (cardiac death ensures) or their brain dies (brain death ensures). We shall come to brain death later. some patients though do survive thanks in no small part to sophisticated life sustaining measures such as ventilators and advances in critical care medicine. If these patients are followed the outcomes are varied. some may wake up and start interacting with the environment (talking, responding appropriately to pain and so forth). some who are in minimally conscious state (MCs) are able to demonstrate cognitively mediated behaviors but only inconsistently. A few may wake up, open their eyes and even yawn but when closely assessed have no meaningful interaction with their environment. It is these patients who after a period of observation are determined to be in a PVs. A person who is in a PVs shall never talk, walk or interact with his loved ones in a meaningful manner. In a way he is a vegetable. PVs is very different from BD. In BD there is irreversible damage either to the whole brain or the brain stem. For a person to be brain dead certain strictly defined criteria need to be met. These criteria with minor variations such as length of observation, interval between repeat testing, number of physicians needed to certify BD are essentially similar across the world and include absence of all brainstem function (brainstem reflexes) on clinical testing, no response to pain and no spontaneous respirations. t",

For conceptual clarity, it is helpful to consider that there are different ways in which emotional factors can exert an influence on the course of any illness. Several of these factors are briefly described as follows: 1. Occasionally the emotional state or set of attitudes of the patient may be reflected in his inability or unwillingness to cooperate with the therapeutic regimen prescribed for him. This difficulty may be encountered, of course, in every degree of severity ranging from mildly annoying uncooperativeness to defiance of medical advice with tragic consequences. Such help-rejecting behavior may stem from a variety of psychological roots. For example,",

Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking behaviour and consumption, loss of control in limiting consumption and drug dependence typified by withdrawal symptoms when access to the drug is denied. An overviewof the background and our current understanding of the mechanisms that underpin substance abuse and addiction is provided in this chapter. The findings from neurobiological studies suggest that the initial response to addictive substances activate both 'liking' (hedonic) and 'wanting' hotspots in the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum, provoking both the pleasurable effects and the desire to continue taking such agents. People who are dependent on alcohol will display withdrawal symptoms on abrupt cessation of drinking or significant reductions in intake. The withdrawal symptoms include nausea, emesis, tremor, tachycardia, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and transitory hallucinations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background The use of electronic cigarettes (e‐cigarettes) is very common worldwide. To date, an increase of nicotine intoxication following an accidental or intentional ingestion/injection of refill solution (e‐liquid) has been detected. Case A 23‐year‐old man presented with sudden loss of consciousness, bradycardia, and respiratory muscle paralysis after intentional ingestion of e‐liquid. Early clinical data, brain computed tomography, and neurophysiological tests (electroencephalogram [EEG] and somatosensory evoked potentials [SEPs]) did not show features with a poor neurological prognostic meaning of an hypoxic encephalopathy. After 4 days, the patient showed bilateral loss of the pupillary reflex, and severe and cytotoxic edema was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. SEPs showed a bilateral loss of cortical responses and EEG a suppressed pattern. Nine days after the onset of coma, the patient evolved toward brain death (BD). Discussion Because nicotine intoxication might cause respiratory muscle paralysis, without cardiac arrest (CA), it would be important to understand the mechanisms underlying brain damage and to take into account that the current neurological prognostic evidence for hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy, based on data from patients who all experienced CA may not be reliable. Reporting cases of nicotine intoxication through e‐liquid is relevant in order to improve regulatory parameters for e‐liquid sale.",

It consists of two opposite states, manic state and depressive state. Typical manic symptoms include a pathologic delightful mood, flight of ideas, heightened level of activity and sexual interest. Grandiosity, rapid and pressured speech, increased energy and decreased need for sleep are also frequently seen. On the other hand, depressive symptoms are characterized by prolonged depressive mood, inhibition of thought, lowered level of activity, depressive ideas or delusions and various somatic dysfunctions such as loss of appetite and sleep disturbance. Mood disorders are often seen in association with organic brain diseases, collagen diseases such as SLE, some endocrinological diseases and medication. Diagnosis of manic or depressive states is usually carried out by careful psychiatric interviews. No specific somatic symptoms or signs have been identified for manic-depressive illness. Many rating scales, for instance Zung's SDS or HDSR, have been utilized as diagnostic aids. Rating scales and the symptomatology and diagnosis of manic-depressive illness are described in general.",

It is demonstrated by the cases reported, that upon the sudden death of a juvenile increased consideration must also be given to a possible connection between death and drug use. First and foremost the drug used is susceptible of leading to death by way of an intoxication due to too large a dosage or owing to oversensitiveness. Far advanced putrefaction, the combined effects of several drugs including alcohol, the difficulty in furnishing chemical proof of the presence of hashish and LSD in body-fluids and organs can make it nearly impossible to clarify the cause of death. Only what has been related in respect of the manner of living and drug use by members of the family, mates and friends makes the connection between death and drug use appear quite likely. The indirect connection between drug use and the juvenile's death is to be accepted if it comes to the accident under the influence of drugs - be it under the impression of invulnerability or omnipotence or in a state of hallucinations. Depressions under the influence of drugs are also susceptible of resulting in real suicidal actions.

Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms.

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

In the new classification system DSM-III-R the concept of dysthymia is more clearly defined and delimited. It is there defined as a chronic mood disorder, particularly characteristic in cases with an early onset. Coexisting personality disturbance is relatively common. Dysthymia is a common kind of mood disorder. Often the symptoms are heterogeneous. In about one-third of the cases there are superimposed episodes of major depression, called double depression. As a result of the chronic course of dysthymia, dependence on alcohol or other substances is common. Double depression is relatively well suited to antidepressive treatment, whereas “pure” dysthymias, the mildest case in particular, show little response to antidepressant drugs. The concept of reactive depression is discussed. In DSM-III-R this is at present not included under mood disorders (but is found under adjustment disorders). There is no obvious reason why it should not be considered an additional kind of mood disorder.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric illness is common, affecting up to 10% of the population, with around 1% diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder. An increased mortality rate in the postoperative period for schizophrenic patients receiving chronic antipsychotic therapy has been demonstrated. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disease, schizophrenia-associated psychotic disorders are characterized by disturbances in emotional, behavioral and cognitive arenas, impeding on nearly every aspect of life functioning in the form of thought disorders, delusions and hallucinations. Chronic schizophrenic patients lack pain sensitivity, and have pituitary-adrenal and autonomic nerve dysfunction, abnormalities of the immune system, and water intoxication. These alterations may influence postoperative outcome. Psychotropic drugs often given in combination with each other or with other non-psychiatric drugs generally exert profound effects on the central and peripheral neurotransmitter and ionic mechanisms. The increased complications are associated with physical disorders, antipsychotic or hazardous health behaviour and interactions between antipsychotics and anaesthetic drugs. Adverse responses during anaesthesia include arrhythmias, hypotension, prolonged narcosis or coma, hyperpyrexia, post-operative ileus and post-operative confusion. Although drug interaction probably remains the most potentially serious problem current evidence suggests that psychiatric medication need not be discontinued prior to anesthesia.",

Symptoms of Meniere’s disease include recurring episodes of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo and a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear. Remissions occur for varying periods of time between attacks, but recurrences can progressively damage the hearing apparatus and eventually lead to permanent hearing loss. The cause of Meniere’s disease is unknown. When the condition occurs secondary to known causes such as infection, trauma, or an autoimmune disease, it is called Meniere’s syndrome or secondary EH. Patients with Meniere’s disease are typically advised to avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol because these substances aggravate symptoms in some cases. Conventional treatment may also include measures to reduce fluid levels in the body (ie, a low-sodium diet [≤1.5 g/day] and diuretics), drugs that suppress the vestibular system (eg, meclizine, prochlorperazine, or diazepam), and glucocorticoids. Various surgical procedures may be recommended when medical treatment is ineffective. A number of natural remedies have shown promise in the treatment of Meniere’s disease, but most of these treatments are based on clinical observations or uncontrolled trials.",

      "abstract": "Hoarseness is a common presentation in primary care practices. Combined with other voice-related changes, it falls under the umbrella diagnosis of dysphonia. Hoarseness has a number of causes, ranging from simple inflammatory processes to less common psychiatric disorders to more serious systemic, neurologic, or cancerous conditions. Medication-induced hoarseness is common and should be considered. The initial evaluation begins with a targeted history and physical examination, while also looking for signs of potential systemic etiologies. Treatment should begin with voice rest, especially avoidance of whispering, and conservative management directed toward a presumptive cause. For example, proton pump inhibitors are appropriate for hoarseness due to reflux, and proper vocal hygiene is recommended for vocal abuse-related indications. In the absence of a clear indication, antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, and proton pump inhibitors should not be used for the empiric treatment of hoarseness. Direct visualization of the larynx and vocal folds, commonly mislabeled as vocal cords, should be performed within three months if an etiology has not been determined or if conservative management has been ineffective. Patients who experience symptoms lasting longer than two weeks and who have risk factors for dysplasia (e.g., tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, hemoptysis) may require earlier laryngoscopic evaluation. Voice therapy is effective for improving voice quality in patients with dysphonia if conservative measures are unsuccessful, and it can also be helpful for prophylaxis in high-risk individuals (e.g., vocalists, public speakers). Surgical management is indicated for laryngeal or vocal fold dysplasia or malignancy, airway obstruction, or benign pathology resistant to conservative treatment.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To discuss a case of synthethic marijuana use and subsequent withdrawal phenomenon that clinically resulted in PRES. Background: In the last decade synthetic marijuana has emerged as a new drug of abuse. Synthetic marijuana is colloquial known as “Spice,” which is typically composed of herbs, spices and other plant matter that are sprayed with at least one synthetic cannabinoid. They have diverse chemicals that are structurally distinct from THC. Given the heterogeneity of chemical composition, the intoxication effects are diverse. The presence of a withdrawal phenomenon following chronic use and clinical sequeale are not explored in the literature to date. Design/Methods: We discuss a case presentation of acute intoxication, withdrawal phenomenology and subsequent neurological complications of synthetic marijuana usage including PRES. Results: A 26yo man was found by police and paramedics to be confused and combative after he had smoked synthetic cannabinoids earlier in the evening. He was restrained by police and brought to the emergency department where he was noted to be febrile, combative and confused with normal heart rate and blood pressure. He had an unremarkable initial head computed tomography (CT) image. His labs were significant for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. His LP showed no xanthochromia or pleocytosis. On days 2–4 of the hospitalization he exhibited autonomic instability following withdrawal of his daily consumption of synthetic marijuana. A MRI was eventually obtained following 8 days in the hospital because of unresolved encephalopathy. It showed evidence of PRES, right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), small bilateral cortical and corpus collosum hemorrhages and superior cerebellar vermis subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of vasospasm or vasoconstriction or aneurysm. Conclusions: Our patient exhibited withdrawal phenomenon following 2 days cessation of daily synthetic marijuana. Clinically the patient exhibited autonomic instability and poor mentation resulting radiographically in PRES, ICH and SAH. Disclosure: Dr. Stack has nothing to disclose.",

      "title": "Panic Disorder With and Without Agoraphobia",
      "abstract": "Panic disorder is characterized by two components: recurrent panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety. Panic attacks within panic disorder are not caused by physical illness or certain substances and they are unexpected, at least initially; later in the course of the disorder, many attacks may be precipitated by certain situations or are more likely to occur in them. Anticipatory anxiety is an intense fear of having another panic attack, which is present between panic attacks. Some patients with panic disorder go on to develop agoraphobia, usually defined as fear and/or avoidance of the situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing or in which help might not be available in case of a panic attack; in such cases, patients are diagnosed with panic disorder with agoraphobia. Those who do not develop agoraphobia receive a diagnosis of panic disorder without agoraphobia. Components of panic disorder are presented in Figure 2—1. Patients with agoraphobia who have no history of panic disorder or whose agoraphobia is not related at least to panic attacks or symptoms of panic attacks are relatively rarely encountered in clinical practice. The diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder has been a matter of some controversy, especially in view of the differences between American and European psychiatrists (and the DSM and ICD diagnostic and classification systems) in the conceptualization of the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia. The conceptualization adhered to here has for the most part been derived from the DSM system, as there is more empirical support for it. Although panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) is a relatively well-defined psychopathological entity whose treatment is generally rewarding, there are important, unresolved issues. They are listed below and discussed throughout this chapter. …1. Are there different types of panic attacks based on the absence or presence of the context in which they appear (i.e., unexpected vs. situational attacks)? Should the ‘‘subtyping’’ of panic attacks be based on other criteria (e.g., symptom profile)? 2. Because panic attacks are not specific for panic disorder, should they continue to be the main feature of panic disorder? Can panic attacks occurring as part of panic disorder be reliably distinguished from panic attacks occurring as part of other disorders or in the absence of any psychopathology? 3. What is the relationship between panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia?",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population. Gastric acid blockers, benzodiazepines, some antidepressants and opioid analgetics have been described in the review.",

      "title": "Central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS) in anesthesia and intensive care.",
      "abstract": "Many of the drugs used in anesthesia and intensive care may cause blockade of the central cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetylcholine is of significance in modulation of the interaction among most other central transmitters. The clinical picture of the central cholinergic blockade, known as the central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS), is identical with the central symptoms of atropine intoxication. This behaviour consists of agitation including seizures, restlessness, hallucinations, disorientation or signs of depression such as stupor, coma and respiratory depression. Such disturbances may be induced by opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, ketamine, etomidate, propofol, nitrous oxide, and halogenated inhalation anesthetics as well as by H2-blocking agents such as cimetidine. There is an individual predisposition for CAS--but unpredictable from laboratory findings or other signs. Reports of postanesthetic occurrence of the CAS requiring treatment are not unanimous, varying between 1 and 40%. Differential diagnosis of the CAS includes disorders of glucose and electrolyte metabolism, severe hormonal imbalance, respiratory disorders (hypoxia, hypercarbia), hypothermia, hyperthermia and neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral hypoxia, stroke, catatony, acute psychosis). The CAS may considerably impair the postanesthetic period especially when agitation is prevalent, which may endanger the patient or the surgical results. The diagnosis is confirmed ex iuvantibus by the sudden increase in the acetylcholine level in the brain. This is achieved with physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor able to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Its peripheral muscarinic effects are minimal. Postanesthetic CAS can be prevented by administration of physostigmine during the anesthesia procedure. During intensive care (IC), agitated forms of CAS may occur in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, particularly during prolonged high-dose sedation. Artificial ventilation of such patients becomes very difficult and muscle relaxation may be necessary. In these cases of IC-CAS, physostigmine is of value and has proven beneficial during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dealing with the CAS for more than a decade has improved knowledge of the central cholinergic transmission. For example, it can be said that CAS occurs alongside general anesthesia, being no more than a frequent side-effect. Furthermore, acetylcholine is involved in nociception through the endorphinergic and the serotoninergic systems. There is a close relation between the central cholinergic transmission and actions of nitrous oxide. Moreover, cholinergic transmission is involved in withdrawal from (among others) alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens and nitrous oxide. In some intoxications with psychoactive agents, physostigmine is useful for reversal of the central nervous symptoms of the acute intoxication itself. In addition it can be used for prevention of some withdrawal states. In",

The patient's behavior in these situations may be motivated by the psychological meanings, interpersonal communications, or social consequences of taking pills. The physician may be able to identify these psychosocial factors by learning about the patient's prior experiences with medications, by eliciting his views of physicians and medical care, and by understanding the consequences of becoming a patient.

      "title": "Intermediate Syndrome Following Organophosphate Insecticide Poisoning",
      "abstract": "Acute organophosphate insecticide poisoning can manifest 3 different phases of toxic effects, namely, acute cholinergic crisis, intermediate syndrome (IMS), and delayed neuropathy. Among them, IMS has been considered as a major contributing factor of organophosphate-related morbidity and mortality because of its frequent occurrence and probable consequence of respiratory failure. Despite a high incidence, the pathophysiology that underlies IMS remains unclear. Previously proposed mechanisms of IMS include different susceptibility of various cholinergic receptors, muscle necrosis, prolonged acetylcholinesterase inhibition, inadequate oxime therapy, downregulation or desensitization of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, failure of postsynaptic acetylcholine release, and oxidative stress-related myopathy. The clinical manifestations of IMS typically occur within 24 to 96 hours, affecting conscious patients without cholinergic signs, and involve the muscles of respiration, proximal limb muscles, neck flexors, and muscles innervated by motor cranial nerves. With appropriate therapy that commonly includes artificial respiration, complete recovery develops 5–18 days later. Patients with atypical manifestations of IMS, especially a relapse or a continuum of acute cholinergic crisis, however, were frequently reported in clinical studies of IMS. The treatment of IMS is mainly supportive. Nevertheless, because IMS generally concurs with severe organophosphate toxicity and persistent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, early aggressive decontamination, appropriate antidotal therapy, and prompt institution of ventilatory support should be helpful in ameliorating the magnitude and/or the incidence of IMS. Although IMS is well recognized as a disorder of neuromuscular junctions, its exact etiology, incidence, and risk factors are not clearly defined because existing studies are largely small-scale case series and do not employ a consistent and rigorous definition of IMS. Without a clear understanding of the pathophysiology of IMS, specific therapy is not available. The prognosis of IMS, however, is likely to be favorable if respiratory failure can be promptly recognized and treated accordingly.",

      "title": "Stress and Relapse to Drug Seeking: Studies in Laboratory Animals Shed Light on Mechanisms and Sources of Long‐Term Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "Relapse is a major characteristic of drug addiction disorders and remains the primary problem for treatment. Recently, there has been hope that these disorders may be amenable to pharmacological treatments that have successfully treated other psychopathological disorders. Pharmacological approaches to drug abuse have tended to be guided by the primary drug used by the individual, though substitution has been the guiding principle in some instances, as in the case of methadone maintenance in opioid addiction. Alternatively, blockade or antagonism of the effects of the primary drug being abused has been tried, as in the case of using naltrexone to treat opioid or alcohol addiction. Though reportedly successful in some populations, it is not clear that these approaches effectively control craving for ‘highs’ or euphoric experiences or a return to drug use as a response to stressful life experiences. Recent experimental studies of the factors that induce craving and relapse to drug use in both humans and laboratory animals, such as drug‐related cues, re‐exposure to the drug itself, or exposure to stressful events, have shown that the effects of these different events are mediated by dissociable neurochemical circuitry. Another finding that emerges from these studies is that the motivation underlying drug seeking induced by events that precipitate relapse is intensified by the duration and amount of pre‐exposure to a drug and the passage of time since withdrawal of the drug. One implication of such findings for the treatment of addiction is that whatever approach is taken, treatment will have to be multifaceted and maintained over an extended period of time after the initial termination of drug use.",

This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "abstract": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e. Seizure is common presentation f. Pathology1) Pattern (from most common to least common): often fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic astrocytomas2) Fibrillary astrocytomas (Fig. 16-1) a) Well-differentiated astrocytes with scant cyto-plasm; atypical and hyperchromatic nuclei; fine, fibrillary processesb) Microcysts containing mucinous material c) Scant to absent mitotic figures and vascularproliferation d) Calcification is rare but may occur in up to 10% to20% of cases 3) Protoplasmic astrocytomasa) Hypocellular b) Cells with small round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm c) Prominent characteristic microcystic spaces4) Gemistocytic astrocytomas (Fig. 16-2) a) Large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmand eccentrically placed nuclei b) Usually worse prognosis c) Malignant transformation: more often than otherpathologic subtypesTable 16-1. WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a.

Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf.

Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9. Reduced survival has been associated with young age at onset and anaplastic histopathologic features, and higher risk of recurrence with partial resectionsK. Subependymoma 1. Slow-growing large firm masses most often occurring infourth ventricle, arising from medulla or lateral ventricles attached to septum pellucidum2. Age at presentation: usually between 40 and 60 years 3. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-12): cells with roundnuclei and sparse cytoplasm; admixed with microcystic clusters and foci of calcification on a fibrillary background4. Neuroimaging characteristics: mildly hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images often with heterogeneous appearance and little to no enhancementA. Ganglion Cell Neoplasms 1.

Some neoplastic ganglion cells are binucleated or multinucleated (unfortunately not always present, but quite helpful when present) (Fig. 16-13)7. Treatment a. Resection b. Radiotherapy: reserved for recurrent tumor or thosewith anaplastic histopathologic features 8. Prognosisa. Most carry benign prognosis with total or subtotal resectionb.

Commonly present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (most commonly, headaches)4. Most commonly an intraventricular location, often at foramen of Monro: 50% of all intraventricular tumors in adults5. Microscopic features: sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei; immunoreactive for synaptophysin6. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous signal (isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images) with heterogeneous enhancement (Fig. 6-14)7. Treatment often involves resection (total, if possible) 8.

Commonly presents as slow-growing cerebellar mass with increased intracranial pressure2. Commonly presents in the fourth decade 3. Associated with Cowden’s disease (about 50% ofpatients with dysplastic gangliocytoma have clinical stigmata of Cowden’s disease)4. Macroscopic features: hypertrophied, thickened cerebellar folia (Fig. 16-15)5. Microscopic features a. Enlarged ganglion cells (neurons) replace granule cells,atrophy of granular layer b.

      "abstract": "Ruling out medical conditions that can cause depression or cognitive impairment is essential in effectively caring for elderly patients. Case examples illustrate how these may present. Diabetes can cause confusion due to either hyper- or hypoglycemia. Congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can cause hypoxia and resulting confusion. Sleep apnea can present with amnesia, apathy, and depression. Physiological changes make elderly patients especially susceptible to adverse drug effects, including hyponatremia and anticholinergic symptoms. Depression and cognitive changes have been associated with both hyper- and hypothyroidism, as well as with hyperparathyroidism. Elderly patients are at risk for developing subdural hematomas which can present with cognitive deficits and blunting of mood, and some patients may not have taken notice of the traumatic incident. Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with neurological symptoms including dementia, and cancer may present with fatigue and weight loss, which may be interpreted as depression.",

      "abstract": "Although nitrate therapy, used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, is frequently associated with side-effects, mainly headaches, the summaries of product characteristics of nitrate-containing medicines do not report detailed description of headaches and even do not highlight the possibility of nitrate-induced migraine. Two different types of nitrate-induced headaches have been described: (i) immediate headaches that develop within the first hour of the application, are mild or medium severity without characteristic symptoms for migraine, and ease spontaneously; and (ii) delayed, moderate or severe migraine-type headaches (occurring mainly in subjects with personal or family history of migraine), that develop 3-6 h after the intake of nitrates, with debilitating, long-lasting symptoms including nausea, vomiting, photo- and/or phono-phobia. These two types of headaches are remarkably different, not only in their timing and symptoms, but also in the persons who are at risk. Recent studies provide evidence that the two headache types are caused by different mechanisms: immediate headaches are connected to vasodilation caused by nitric oxide (NO) release, while migraines are triggered by other actions such as the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide or glutamate, or changes in ion channel function mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate or S-nitrosylation. Migraines usually need anti-attack medication, such as triptans, but these drugs are contraindicated in most medical conditions that are treated using nitrates. In conclusion, these data recommend the correction of summaries of nitrate product characteristics, and also suggest a need to develop new types of anti-migraine drugs, effective in migraine attacks, that could be used in patients with risk for angina pectoris.",

Drugs causing intoxications can in general be divided into three groups: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Opioids act through a mu receptor present in the central nervous system. Drugs like dilaudid, morphine, methadone, and heroin all belong to the opioid family. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their activity on the postsynaptic membrane. Withdrawal from marijuana presents with mild symptoms or irritability, depression, insomnia, nausea, and anorexia. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance. Intoxication presentation may vary and include talkative, flirtatious, aggressive, moody, or disinhibited behaviors. Intoxicated patients may not be competent enough to make reasonable decisions in terms of their medical care as well as pose a potential danger to self and others.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Faculty Opinions recommendation of Treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementias with psychopharmaceuticals: a review.",
      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

Anesthesiologists administer these drugs to induce or maintain general anesthesia to facilitate surgery. Drugs given to induce anesthesia can be given either as gases or as injections. There are three kinds of aesthetics namely; general, regional and local. Any anesthetic technique has potential for complications. A number of more serious complications are associated with general anesthetics, but they are very rare. Possible complications include: a serious allergic reaction to the anesthetic, an inherited reaction to the anesthetic or death. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea, geriatric patients etc are at high risk of developing complications when having surgery or other invasive interventions during general anesthesia. Risks and side effects include nausea and vomiting, physical injuries, embolism, peripheral nerve injury, aspiration pneumonitis, damage to teeth etc. Complications are more likely to occur if you are having major surgery or emergency surgery, have any other illnesses, smoke, or are overweight.\r\nReason: To provide an updated review on the various adverse effects and complications of general anesthetics and methods of managing it.",

The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 400 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training so that sedationists can effectively respond to these adverse events or preempt them.

Additionally, two literature searches were established on PubMed. Three types of bruxism were distinguished: sleep bruxism, awake bruxism and non-specified bruxism. Generally, there are insufficient evidence-based data to draw definite conclusions concerning medications and addictive substances inducing or aggravating sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism as well as concerning medications attenuating sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism. There are insufficient evidence-based data to draw definite conclusions concerning medications and addictive substances inducing or aggravating sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism as well as concerning medications attenuating sleep bruxism and/or awake bruxism.",

      "title": "Drug treatments for schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "This paper summarises the research evidence presented in a recent issue of Effective Health Care on drug treatments for schizophrenia.1\n\nSchizophrenia is an illness or a group of illnesses affecting language, planning, emotion, perceptions, and movement. In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

      "title": "The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines is accompanied by a withdrawal syndrome which is typically characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, dry wretching and nausea, some weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness and a host of perceptual changes. Instances are also reported within the high‐dosage category of more serious developments such as seizures and psychotic reactions. Withdrawal from normal dosage benzodiazepine treatment can result in a number of symptomatic patterns. The most common is a short‐lived “rebound” anxiety and insomnia, coming on within 1‐4 days of discontinuation, depending on the half‐life of the particular drug. The second pattern is the full‐blown withdrawal syndrome, usually lasting 10–14 days; finally, a third pattern may represent the return of anxiety symptoms which then persist until some form of treatment is instituted. Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines can occur following prolonged treatment with therapeutic doses, but it is not clear what proportion of patients are likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome. It is also unknown to what extent the risk of physiological dependence is dependent upon a minimum duration of exposure or dosage of these drugs. Withdrawal phenomena appear to be more severe following withdrawal from high doses or short‐acting benzodiazepines. Dependence on alcohol or other sedatives may increase the risk of benzodiazepine dependence, but it has proved difficult to demonstrate unequivocally differences in the relative abuse potential of individual benzodiazepines.",

Because of their widespread prescription and the continued social use of alcohol, it is necessary to test for interaction between these agents. Drug-induced atropine-like effects in humans (including dry mouth, constipation and paralytic ileus) are described and related to animal experiments. Radiological investigations in mice indicate that alcohol delays the passage of barium along the gut, and this effect is enhanced by psychotropic drugs. Related drug interactions may result in prolonged or delayed adverse reactions. Late (delayed) deaths, recently recorded in humans and animals, may be associated with the inhibition of gastro-intestinal motility by ethical psychotropic agents, particularly when taken together with alcohol. Patients given these drugs should in general be warned against the concurrent use of alcohol.",

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 44 million Americans report using in the past month. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to a month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder or cannabis withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Conduct disorder is the most prevalent psychopathologic condition of childhood. It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

The nature of the hallucination assists localization, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning. In particular, the presence of persistent visual hallucinations of persons with Parkinson's disease predicts dementia, rapid deterioration, permanent nursing home placement, and death. Hallucinations in persons with Alzheimer's disease are often associated with serious behavioral problems and predict a rapid cognitive decline. Theories of the etiology of hallucinations include (1) stimulation, e.g., neurochemical, electrical, seizure, and ephaptic, and (2) inhibition, e.g., destruction of normally inhibitory functions, resulting in disinhibition as in the Charles Bonnet and phantom limb syndromes. Functional neuroimaging procedures suggest anatomical associations for hallucinations. While hallucinations may be a symptom of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, they may also occur in a wide range of human experiences.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Post-stroke apathy is a disturbance of motivation evidenced by low initiative, difficulties in starting, sustaining or finishing any goal-directed activity, low self-activation or self-initiated behavior and emotional indifference. Apathy is a common behavioral disturbance in stroke survivors. We aimed to analyze the relationship between post-stroke apathy at 1 year after stroke and (1) apathy in acute phase; (2) demographic, pre-stroke predisposing conditions (previous mild cognitive impairment, alcohol abuse, mood/anxiety disorder) and clinical features (stroke type and location, neurological symptoms); (3) post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, and (4) post-stroke functional outcome, quality of life and the perception of health. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive stroke (infarct/intracerebral hemorrhage) patients without aphasia or consciousness disturbances were included in the acute phase of stroke and assessed at 1 year after stroke. We assessed apathy with the clinically rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. We also assessed post-stroke depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and post-stroke cognitive impairment (attention, mental flexibility, verbal, motor and graphomotor initiative, and non-verbal and verbal abstract reasoning, and Mini-Mental State Examination), functional outcome (Barthel Index), quality of life and perception of health (EuroQol). Data were analyzed using bivariate associations (χ<sup>2</sup> and t test) and stepwise multivariate analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We included 76 stroke patients [32.9% women, mean age 62.9 years (SD = 10.9) and a mean of 6.9 (SD = 4.3) years of education]. Apathy was present in 17 patients in the acute phase and in 18 (23.7%) patients at 1 year after stroke. At 1 year after stroke, 41% of the acute apathetic patients remained apathetic. Sixty-one percent of new cases of post-stroke apathy were detected. Post-stroke apathy was associated only with previous cognitive impairment, apathy in acute stroke, post-stroke cognitive impairment, verbal abstract reasoning and with worse Barthel Index scale scores. In the multivariate logistic regression model, verbal abstract reasoning (odds ratio, OR = 7.03) and apathy in acute stroke (OR = 3.8) were identified as independent factors for post-stroke apathy at 1 year. Apathetic patients did not report worse quality of life or health. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Apathy in acute stroke phase was a reliable indicator of post-stroke apathy. Apathy should be assessed in both phases. Verbal abstract reasoning impairment was also an independent factor for post-stroke apathy impairing patients' ability to reason about goal-directed activity. Even though apathetic patients had worse post-stroke functional outcome, they did not report losing quality of life or having worse health.",

      "abstract": "The answers to two questions: (1) “Do you feel you are the same person as you were before the cerebral event? And (2) When did the sensed presence begin?” are powerful indicators of cerebral dysfunction during the first two or three years subsequent to significant mechanical impacts to the skull even though traditional neurological screening or examinations are within the normal range. These patients also display protracted difficulties with adaptation and rarely have returned to previous employment. Re-attributing the patient’s interpretations of these disturbing experiences from a neurological perspective facilitates adaptation. These interventions might diminish the subjective exacerbations that frequently result in psychiatric referrals years later.",

      "abstract": "When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the \"withdrawal triad,\" comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

      "abstract": "There has been a worrying trend in Kashmir i.e. the growth of posttraumatic stress disorder, a mental condition which is affecting people for more than two decades. The continuous political uncertainty, insecurity from armed forces; natural calamities are the contributory factors. And it is found that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is on the rise in Kashmir Valley after the worst ever floods hit the state few months back. Psychiatrists in Srinagar opine that there has been a remarkable increase in the number of patients who were suffering from “early symptoms” of PTSD. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a condition that develops after an individual expose through a terrifying ordeal that involves physical harm or the threat of a physical harm. The condition develops amongst the people who may have gone through some physical harm or might have witnessed their loved ones or the people around them being harmed. The trauma affects people in three ways: negative, neutral and positive. Under the positive category, the affected person somehow gets encouraged and takes up challenges. Their condition does not make any difference to them. Highly stressful events or major life traumas (such as serious illness, road traffic accident, death of a relative or loved one, unemployment, divorce, etc.) can lead to a variety of behavioral, psychological and emotional negative outcomes to the disruptive and aversive conditions (Taku, Cann, Tedeschi, &amp; Calhoun, 2009). The positive side of the trauma is that it also leads to growth. This phenomenon has been recognized as a distinct construct – posttraumatic growth (Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996), implying ‘‘positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances’’ (Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004, p. 1). Positive change has been noted in the literature by various authors and referred to in diverse terms – among others, benefit-finding (Affleck &amp; Tennen, 1996), stress-related growth (Park, Cohen, &amp; Murch, 1996), adversarial growth (Linley &amp; Joseph, 2004), flourishing (Ryff &amp; Singer, 1998), and thriving (O’Leary &amp; Ickovics, 1995). The main objective of the paper is to discuss the role of Islam with special reference to Qur’an and Sunna in posttraumatic Growth among violence victims in Kashmir valley India. Islamic practices such as prayer and listening Qur’an plays important role in coping with traumatic disorders. Islamic values and beliefs can be beneficial in overcoming traumatic life events and seeking posttraumatic Growth. The Holy Qur’an teaches us “The truly righteous — are those who endure with fortitude misfortune, hardship and peril. That is, who are patient in poverty and affliction, and in time of war” (2:178).",

A sportolók körében több pszichiátriai kórkép hívja fel magára a figyelmet vagy a magas prevalencia, vagy egy-egy specifikus szindróma kialakulása által. A depresszió (versenyzés utáni depresszió, a megmérettetés meghiúsulása utáni depresszió), a krónikus stressz, szorongás, a túledzési szindróma, fáradékonyság, enerváltság, alvászavarok, étkezési zavarok tünetei, a burnout, az evészavarok (anorexia athletica, atlétatriász), személyiségtényezők és a kémiai addikciók mind rendkívül fontosak. A jelen tanulmány elsőként foglalja össze azokat a legfontosabb pszichiátriai kórképeket, amelyek a sportolópopulációban, az egyes sportágak szerint különböző mértékben, nagy jelentőséggel bírhatnak.",

      "title": "The Role of NMDA Receptors in Opiate Tolerance, Sensitization, and Physical Dependence",
      "abstract": "When administered acutely, opiates such as morphine produce characteristic behavioral effects, including a decrease in pain responsiveness (analgesia) and an increase in pleasure (euphoria). Because of their profound ability to produce analgesia, opiates are the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe or chronic pain. Because of their ability to produce positive reinforcement and pleasure, these drugs are widely self-administered and, therefore, represent an important class of abused drugs. Long-term treatment with opiates, as well as other drugs of abuse, leads to three well-known consequences: tolerance, which is a decrease in an effect of a drug with chronic use; sensitization, which is an increase in an effect of drug with chronic use; and physical dependence, which is a physiological change produced by chronic use, such that the absence of the drug results in an unpleasant withdrawal syndrome* (1–3). Tolerance, sensitization, and physical dependence are important in both the clinical use of opiates and in their self-administration. For example, the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of opiates may lead to the need to escalate the dose during the treatment of chronic pain, whereas tolerance to the euphorigenic effect may be a factor in the escalation of drug use in addicts (4). Conversely, tolerance to dose-limiting side effects may allow addicts to escalate drug intake and achieve greater euphorigenic effects. The development of sensitization is thought to be involved in the craving that occurs following chronic use of drugs of abuse and, therefore, critical to addiction (5,6). Finally, the avoidance of withdrawal in physically dependent individuals is considered to be an important factor in maintaining self-administration (2,4).",

      "title": "Resilience and Vulnerability in Coping with Stress and Terrorism",
      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting movement, emotion, speech, and behavior, which commonly occurs secondary to medical or psychiatric disorders and with comorbid illnesses. We report the case of an 18-year-old male with a history of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, polysubstance use, and previous suicide attempts who presented to the hospital from a residential eating disorders treatment facility, due to psychomotor slowing. The patient scored 3 or lower on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), but he showed marked improvement following 2 mg of intravenous lorazepam. The patient was referred for ECT, experienced dramatic improvement, and was discharged at his baseline functioning. His discharge diagnosis was catatonic syndrome secondary to severe melancholic depression. Catatonia may present a diagnostic challenge as no single catatonia screener captures all possible phenotypes. The patient consistently scored low on the BFCRS but he had a clear response to standard-of-care catatonia treatment. Psychomotor slowing is common in catatonia but is not designated as a catatonic feature in either the DSM-5 or the BFCRS. This case also presented diagnostic complexity as the patient initially presented with malnutrition and concern about a possible eating disorder. This report highlights that diagnosing catatonia is challenging, particularly in the context of medical complexity, and that there are discrepancies between diagnostic tools. When suspicion of catatonia is high, despite low individual screening scores, clinicians may consider alternative screening instruments or empiric treatment.",

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

      "title": "Psychogenic dysphonia",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Dysphonia is altered vocal quality, pitch, loudness, or vocal effort that impairs communication.[1,2] A functional speech disorder is caused by an underlying psychological process in contrast to the organic type.[3] According to The Hysterical Conversion Model of Voice Loss by Freud, an intrapsychic conflict is transformed into a bodily symptom that is connected to or \"symbolizes\" the conflict.[4] A 41-year-old male clerk, having anxious-avoidant traits, after a bilateral tonsillectomy in 2008, could speak only in low volume. During this recovery phase, he was verbally abused by a superior to whom he could not reply and fainted. After waking up, his speech was further limited, and spoke in a strained, forceful manner, one to two words with abrupt pauses. He was treated as a case of spasmodic dysphonia (Adductor) with voice rest, speech therapy, vocal hydration, and one injection of Botulinum toxin. For the next 12 years, he continued with waxing and waning severity of hoarseness, worsening during evenings and winters. He interacted by writing down instructions and escaped demanding situations or direct interactions with his superiors. One of the superiors decided that he needs to be evaluated by a doctor again and he was sent for an ENT review. Hopkin's video-laryngoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Hence, he was referred for psychiatric evaluation of dysphonia. He spoke in a low tone and volume and whispered intermittently. There was occasional normal speech during emotional outbursts, lasting for four to five words. These symptoms originated as mentioned earlier and were sustained due to convenient shouldering-off of responsibilities, avoidance of conflicts, and sympathetic outlook of colleagues and family members. He was diagnosed with dissociative motor disorder (psychogenic dysphonia). Management began with self-monitoring, to discover vocal patterns. At each session, he was counseled on vocal hygiene, which is to ensure adequate hydration, voice rest, and avoid unnecessary voice stresses like shouting. In the direct technique, circum-laryngeal exercises were taught. Coughing was immediately followed by vowel sustenance of [u] and [i]. He was trained on sustained humming, pitch pattern matching, and developing words from lexical categories. Eventually, he sustained a discussion lasting more than 15 min. At times, he recovered his voice by humming and singing hymns. He had to remove the proxy or communicator. His focus was diverted from the words spoken aloud to relaxing the laryngeal muscles whenever he spoke. The psychological factors that contributed to the onset and maintenance of psychogenic dysphonia were taken into consideration when planning the therapy methods. The cognitive elements identified were personalization and discounting the positives. As part of cognitive behavioral therapy, reorganization and self-monitoring of disordered thoughts were practiced. There is a paucity of cases of psychogenic dysphonia that are successfully handled. The intra-psychic conflict could not be directly addressed by catharsis, due to the prolonged delay. Hence the primary and secondary gains were targeted. As an in-patient, he had regular vocal exercises. His improvement was demonstrated by playing old voice records. His family members reinforced practice at home and acknowledged the improvement. At the workplace, he forced himself to speak. During weekly follow-up, he spoke for nearly 3–4 min with near normal tone and volume then gradually trailed off. Required reinforcements and frequent encouragement for acceptable recovery in the next 5 months. Psychogenic dysphonia is rare in males and the long course has a poor prognosis[5]; hence prompt diagnosis, aggressive management, and frequent reviews are recommended.

What is it about a trauma that influences health? Several candidates immediately come to mind. Psychologically, personal upheavals provoke intense and long-lasting emotional changes. The unexpected events are generally associated with cognitive disruption, including rumination and attempts to understand what happened and why. Socially, traumas are known to cause wholesale disruptions in people’s social networks. Behaviorally, and perhaps because of the social and psychological changes, traumas are often associated with lifestyle changes such as unhealthy smoking, drinking, exercise, sleeping, and eating patterns. Each of these psychological, social, and behavioral effects is associated with a host of biological changes, including elevations in cortisol, immune disruption, cardiovascular changes, and a cascade of neurotransmitter changes.",

      "title": "Delayed onset dystonia secondary to neonatal anoxia.",
      "abstract": "D is a movement disorder, which is defined as an “involuntary” sustained muscle contraction affecting one or more sites of the human body. Frequently it originates twisting and respective movements or abnormal postures.1 The dystonic phenomenon occurs during the wake state and increases with fatigue and stress, while it improves with relaxation, hypnosis, and sleep. Childhood dystonia is characterized by a heterogeneous group with strong inherited background. Dystonia is classified according to the etiology.2 The dystonic phenomenon is the only symptom in primary dystonia. In dystonia-plus or secondary dystonia, other neurological abnormalities are also associated consisting of parkinsonism and myoclonus that are probably due to acquired exogenous causes and heredodegenerative disorders.3 In addition, myoclonus, which is sudden and brief muscular contraction,4 might be associated with dystonia in some conditions, including dystonia-plus, neurodegenerative disorders, and secondary dystonia caused by stroke, anoxia, infections, and toxins. We report a case of delayed dystonia associated myoclonus in an adolescent girl, which was secondary to a neonatal anoxia, and we discuss clinical and therapeutic features. A 12-year-old girl was referred to our department for abnormal movement of the right arm. She was the fourth child of unrelated parents, no history of neurological problems was elicited in family members. She was born at term with prolonged labor, neonatal distress with cyanosis that required intensive care. Her psychomotor development was normal, no particular medical problem or school difficulties were noticed until her 12th birthday, thereafter, she developed abnormal posture of the right upper limb with sudden jerks of the hand making limited daily movements. The neurological examination showed dystonia of the right upper limb with myoclonic movements making prehension and writing difficult. This also consisted of adduction of the shoulder, extension, and internal rotation of the elbow and wrist with flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and extension of the interphalangeal joints. The ophthalmological examination did not reveal KayserFleischer ring. The abdominal examination did not reveal any hepatosplenomegaly, and the cardiac, pulmonary, and dermatological examinations were all normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed high signals in the left caudate nucleus, rolandic, and occipital area involving both cortical and sub-cortical sites (Figure 1). Routine laboratory assessments including blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea, creatine, glucose, transaminases, and prothrombin were all found normal. Considering dystonia etiology, investigating metabolic diseases including Wilson disease, organic aciduria, and mitochondrial disease were performed. Urinary and plasmatic copper, ceruloplasmin, CSF, and plasmatic lactic and pyruvic acids, showed all normal levels. The chromatography of urine organic acids was normal, and the anti-DNA autoimmune markers were negative. A muscle biopsy was performed and the histological study did not reveal any fibers disorder. The clinical examination and negative studies completed, suggested a late onset dystonia following neonatal anoxia. Therefore, levodopa treatment was decided with daily dose of 600 mg over 3 months. However, this treatment was interrupted later considering the negative response. Six months later, the symptomatology worsened and she stopped going to school as she became unable to write. The clinical examination found the initial dystonic posture more pronounced with extension to the left upper limb. In addition, dystonia of the left arm was less manifest than on the right side. Nevertheless, she was walking normally without any dystonia of lower limbs and without any extrapyramidal signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed identical lesions to the first examination. The first description of delayed onset dystonia was by Saint Hilaire et al,5 and several reports have been published describing the clinical presentation with delay ranging from 121 years, and imaging abnormalities were Clinical Notes",

While the sporadic cases are now described, its mortality is usually very high. Its use in the production of adulterated alcoholic beverages has resulted in several outbreaks of acute poisoning. Toxic exposure occurs predominantly orally, although inhalation or transdermal absorption may lead to poisoning. The susceptibility to the toxic effects of methanol is variable, but eating a small amount can lead to severe poisoning. Both accidental poisoning for suicide has a high morbidity and mortality, largely due to the difficulty in confirming the diagnosis is that which delays treatment should be initiated at the slightest suspicion of the table without waiting for laboratory confirmation, since the precocity of the administration of therapeutic measures is crucial to limit damage and allow a potential recovery of the patient.

Compared to younger subjects, addictions in older people are marked by the high frequency of somatic comorbidities, physiological changes related to age, increased severity due to atypical presentations. Moreover, usual screening tests and diagnostic questionnaires are often not suited for the aged. Psychopathology of addictions in the aged points out vulnerabilities not resolved with the advance in age, in connection with separation, narcissism, oral regression, alexithymia and other pathological dimensions of personality. The weight of the environment, dominated by a certain agism, remains a brake to the global care that must be based, as in younger adults, on motivational approach and specific treatments with special pharmacological vigilance.",

Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system is one of the primary targets for the detrimental effects of drugs of abuse. Diagnostic imaging, especially MRI, plays an important role in the detection of complications associated with drug abuse. We present the imaging findings associated with the abuse of opioids and other morphine derivatives, as well, as solvents. Of the morphine derivatives, heroin is the most commonly abused. Several CNS pathologic effects have been described in association with its abuse. These include neurovascular complications such as microvascular ischemic changes or ischemic stroke. A rare form of leukoencephalopathy has been described in those abusers who inhale heroin vapors. Other neurologic complications include atrophy and various infectious processes. Solvent inhalation is a common practice among adolescents and young adults secondary to its ease of access and low cost. The most important component of industrial solvents is toluene. Complications of toluene abuse may be either acute, showing no neuroradiological changes, or chronic, characterized by cerebral and cerebellar demyelination as well as atrophy.",

      "title": "Long-term issues in the treatment of sleep disorders.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

The underlying pathogenesis of dystonia is less well understood than in Parkinson’s disease, in which deep-brain stimulation is generally expected to provide effective and long-lasting benefit. Furthermore, it is likely that dystonia represents a number of different basal ganglia pathologies. The response of dystonia to deep-brain stimulation is typically delayed for up to weeks or months following a change in stimulation parameters. All of these factors make it more difficult to predict outcomes in dystonia following deep-brain stimulation, thus making patient selection all the more important.",

      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

Perceptual alteration showed some distinct features that were different from acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and was accompanied by mood changes such as severe anxiety and agitation and, in one of the patients, also by extrapyramidal symptoms. Perceptual alteration, as well as mood changes and extrapyramidal symptoms, responded well to an anticholinergic drug, biperiden. Recent studies have shown that SEPA occurred not only in schizophrenic patients but also in patients on long‐term neuroleptic medication for treating other mental disorders. These findings suggest that SEPA is associated with dopaminergic hypoactivity in the brain, which is induced by long‐term neuroleptic medication.",

      "abstract": "The changes that often come in later life, like retirement, the death of loved ones, increased isolation, medical problems can lead to depression. Depression prevents person from enjoying life like you used to. But its effects go far beyond mood. It also impacts energy, sleep, appetite, and physical health. However, depression is not an inevitable part of aging, and there are many steps you can take to overcome the symptoms, no matter the challenges person face. Recognizing depression in the elderly starts with knowing the signs and symptoms. Depression in older adults and the elderly is often linked to physical illness, which can increase the risk for depression. Chronic pain and physical disability can understandably get person down. Symptoms of depression can also occur as part of medical problems such as dementia or as a side effect of prescription drugs. Symptoms of depression are a side effect of many commonly prescribed drugs. Person's particularly at risk if he/she's taking multiple medications. While the mood-related side effects of prescription medication can affect anyone, older adults are more sensitive because, as we age, our bodies become less efficient at metabolizing and processing drugs. Depression treatment is just as effective for elderly adults as it is for younger people. Since depression in older adults and the elderly is often the result of a difficult life situation or challenge, any treatment plan should address that issue. If loneliness is at the root of somone's depression, for example, medication alone is not going to cure the problem. Also, any medical issues complicating the depression must be also be addressed. The very nature of depression interferes with a person's ability to seek help, draining energy and self-esteem. For depressed seniors, raised in a time when mental illness was highly stigmatized and misunderstood, it can be even more difficult—especially if they don’t believe depression is a real illness, are too proud or ashamed to ask for assistance, or fear becoming a burden to their families. Nurse has a great part in helping.",

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

In order to evaluate whether social status affect the way drinking alcohol, we investigated the medical social characteristics and differences between alcoholics with periodic and continuous drinking.The results of our study indicate that alcoholics consume alcohol periodically are mostly unmarried, living with friends more frequently in rural areas, are employed and have children. Family history is burdened by their addiction to alcohol and often come not treatment to avoid legal sanctions. Alcoholics with continuous drinking more frequently as a result of the facts of alcoholism are alcoholic polinuropatiju, in most cases, are divorced, live alone and have no children. They grew up with a father or both parents, in these alcoholics no existence, depending on the family or the father has, have trouble with the law as well as injuries in a drunken state.

      "title": "Emergence Delirium in children",
      "abstract": "Delirium after anesthesia, also known as emergence delirium (ED) is a clinical condition in which patients have alterations to their attention, awareness, and perceptions. In children, this often results in behavioral disturbances such as crying, sobbing, thrashing and disorientation. Emergence Agitation (EA) and Emergence Delirium (ED) are commonly used interchangeably; they describe two distinct conditions with emergence delirium being described in the anesthesia literature as a state of mental confusion, agitation, and dis-inhibition marked by some degree of hyper-excitability during recovery from general anesthesia. The commonly reported incidence of emergence delirium is about 10% to 30% of paediatric patients. Risk factors associated with emergence delirium are age, preexisting behaviours, types of surgery and the use of volatile anaesthesia. Transient agitation - delirium from sevoflurane anesthesia can lead to a variety of adverse events, such as airway spasm, shedding or displaced tracheal tube, dehiscence, or bleeding. Volatile anaesthetics may affect brain activity by interfering with the balance between neuronal synaptic inhibition and excitation in the central nervous system. Elevated postoperative pain has been suggested to underlie ED. But given that ED is seen in patients undergoing MRI, pain cannot be the sole cause. Treatment options include the use of premedication, analgesic adjuvants, single dose of propofol at the conclusion of the case. Midazolam premedication, intraoperative dexmedetomidine and fentanyl were associated with lower incidence of ED. The incidence of ED in patients receiving propofol is markedly lower than those receiving sevoflurane, despite the similar rapid emergence profile of both agents. Paediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, developed specifically for children, is a valid and reliable scale. Watcha score is a simpler, reliable tool to measure emergence behaviour. There has been considerable progress in the neuroscience of anaesthesia and the application of new pharmacological agents, but the mystery behind the exact mechanism of ED is elusive. ED is a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes have been dismiss. There is no strong evidence of long-term effects and outcomes in children who developed emergence delirium after anesthesia. Prevention may be the best treatment but no one medication is entirely effective.",

      "title": "Dual pathology and Takotsubo syndrome. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Cocaine use is a significant health problem, since its abuse constitutes a substance use disorder and can produce cardiovascular symptoms, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Tako-tsubo syndrome (TTS) is a transient dysfunction of the apical left ventricle that can manifest with intense chest pain and alterations in the electrocardiogram. TTS can be triggered by physical stressors (hyperthyroidism, cocaine or amphetamine abuse) or psychological stressors (grief or reaction to acute stress). Objectives The objective is to present the case of a patient who developed tako-tsubo syndrome after harmful cocaine use. Methods A 50-year-old woman, under psychiatric follow-up, diagnosed with mixed personality disorder, with a medical history of hypothyroidism. The patient has been presenting for 2 months after mourning the death of her husband with anxiety-depressive symptoms with a great behavioral impact with episodes of heteroaggression and begins with abusive consumption of cannabis and cocaine toxins. The patient presents an episode of psychomotor agitation after acute consumption of cocaine, presenting psychotic symptoms. During the study in the emergency area, she verbalizes chest pain and complementary studies are performed with elevated cardiac enzymes and alterations in the electrocardiogram. Cardiology is contacted and after hospital admission and complementary studies, the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is reached, filiating it with Takotsubo syndrome triggered by cocaine consumption. The diagnoses presented by the patient with dual pathology would be a psychotic disorder due to toxins, a borderline personality disorder and harmful consumption of cocaine. Results Dual pathology in patients with personality disorder with toxin abuse such as in this case cocaine is very frequent.The situation of grief is an acute stressful situation that leads to greater emotional instability and, together with the toxic effects of cocaine, can trigger Takotsubo syndrome in patients. Therefore, when approaching patients with substance use, it is very important to always take into account the possible somatic complications that can be triggered.The treatment chosen to treat the psychotic symptoms that the patient presented was lurasidone, since it has a tolerability and cardiological safety profile. Conclusions In patients with dual pathology, it is very important to address all possible complications, both somatic and psychiatric, for proper therapeutic management.

      "abstract": "The pattern of adverse drug reactions in elderly is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in younger patients. This relates to age-associated changes in physiology, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The combination of several risk factors including the use of several drugs concurrently is of special importance in the elderly. Extreme pharmacokinetic variations due to genetic polymorphism in drug action, may, although not in itself age-related, cause particular problems in the elderly. The best-studied drug oxidation polymorphism, related to the model substances sparteine and debrisoquine, is important for several types of drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants, several neuroleptics and several other types of drugs. Sparteine/debrisoquine-poor metabolizers will with standard doses of tricyclic antidepressants or neuroleptics develop very high steady-state blood levels, and this may cause particular problems in the elderly. There are several examples of how the genetic polymorphism may influence the kinetics of a drug, and some of these are or may become relevant for the psychopharmacology of the elderly.",

Dizziness is often used as a non-specific term to describe many sensations, including vertigo, presyncope, disequilibrium and lightheadedness. In another sense, dizziness can be described more specifically as a feeling of unsteadiness or a mild intoxication, or as if the ground is rocking, or the affected person has to take side-steps to keep balance. Vertigo, by comparison, is often described as a feeling of rotation; the room or surroundings are spinning around like a carousel. Presyncope is often described as sensation of impending fainting or sense of falling. Lightheadedness is a much more vague description of dizziness, difficult to define. Disequilibrium, on the other hand, can be described almost in the same terms as dizziness: a feeling of unsteadiness or loss of balance.",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

Among the somatic disorders associated to the depressive disorder are arthritis, cancer, pulmonary diseases, neurological disorders and heart diseases. Other psychiatric disorders are often comorbid with depressive disorders: alcohol or drug abuse, anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as eating disorders in women. Depression increases by three the risk of cardiac mortality. If depression is not treated, it increases the risk of suicide or other violent actions. The treatment will reduce the risk of suicide to a half, especially in males under 30 years of age. Alcohol or drug abuse, unemployment, social isolation, and impulsivity increase the risk of suicide. Finally, we review the only drugs that have been proved effective in reducing suicidal behavior that are lithium for the risk of suicide in bipolar disorders, and clozapine in the risk of suicide of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "abstract": "Outbreaks of mass hysteria are not uncommon in primitive and modern cultures alike. A group of people will exhibit bizarre behavior, including seizures, tremors, running amok, comatose-like trance or possession states, or other sudden hysterical symptoms with no identifiable medical cause. Western psychiatrists call this Mass Psychogenic Illness. Mass hysteria usually starts with a single individual, and this quickly spreads to others, particularly in close settings such as schools, nunneries, or factories, particularly if individuals are subject to intense anxiety of stress. Sometimes these states are voluntarily elicited in religious or healing ceremonies, with incessant drumming, excitement and suggestibility as one person after another falls into a trance or possession state. Sometimes the outbreak will pertain to a collective fear that is entirely false, for example a collective delusion that there is a poisonous gas in the air-and many people will fall victim to symptoms of toxic poisoning despite the fact that there is nothing in the air. A mass dancing mania emerged following the Black Plague epidemic of the 14th century. People would hop, dance, clap hands and jump about in a frenzy, often naked. How hysteria spreads from the initial case to a group is deeply mysterious. Perhaps hysteria can be contagious much in the same way as a violent mood can spread in a mob and lead to a riot, or there is some sort of decoupling of an individual’s personality in the context of group dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Over the past several decades, a number of definitions of drug addiction have been used. Although some of the historically earliest definitions of addiction or drug dependence relied in part on the consequences of protracted drug exposure as defining characteristics, contemporary definitions generally recognize that use of a psychoactive drug itself is the central element in the process of addiction (see review in ). For example, the recent report of the US Surgeon General on Nicotine Addiction used three primary criteria in defining addiction (): 1. Drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior is driven by strong, often irresistable urges and can persist despite a desire to quit or even repeated attempts to quit; 2. The drug has psychoactive or mood-altering effects in the brain; and 3. The drug is capable of functioning as a reinforcing agent that directly strengthens behavior leading to further drug-taking.",

Second, are psychological amnesias, usually diagnosed as psychoneurosis or hysterias. Third, is feigned amnesia. The distinctive features and the legal complications of these various types of amnesia are discussed. The electroencephalogram ram seems to provide evidence which in many cases may assist in distinguishing pathological amnesia from the other forms. In those cases in which an illegal act is the result of a period of amnesia which in turn is accompanied by a disorder of the electrical waves of the brain, treatment by means of medicine instead of by incarceration seems reasonable. Intensive research on this point is urgently needed.",

DMDD is a condition with an early age of onset (i.e., symptoms apparent by age 10, although the diagnosis cannot be made before age 6); however, nothing is known about the condition among adults in part because questions about temper outbursts (versus \"often losing temper\") are not consistently asked after 6 years of age. Other qualifiers are present so that better-known conditions are not overlooked. For instance, manic symptoms that are present for more than 1 day, symptoms that are not exclusively occurring during major depressive disorder, or symptoms that are better explained by autism, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety, and dysthymia are exclusionary. Although DMDD can co-occur with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and substance use disorder, it preempts diagnoses of both oppositional defiant disorder and intermittent explosive disorder.",

Chronic valve damage may remain asymptomatic for long periods but ultimately leads to haemodynamic overload of the heart. The most common causes of valve disease are rheumatic diseases, infections, chronic renal failure, malformations, and genetic diseases. Valve disease is often attributed to degeneration with no known cause.The frequency of drug-related valve disease has long been underestimated. Most implicated drugs have serotonergic properties, such as fenfluramine-derived amphetamines, including benfluorex. Rye ergot derivatives can also be implicated: these include dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide and cabergoline), migraine treatments (methysergide, ergotamine and dihydroergotamine), and drugs used for cognitive and neurosensory deficits (nicergoline, dihydroergocryptine, etc.). \"Ecstasy\", an amphetamine, is sometimes also involved. The risk increases after a few months of exposure. Drug withdrawal is sometimes followed by an improvement. Patients exposed to a drug known to cause valve damage should be informed of the risk and receive long-term monitoring to detect these lesions before they become irreversible. The possible role of a drug should always be considered when cardiac valve disease is diagnosed, in order to facilitate active research and to avoid exposing other patients to this risk.",

This is a condition that can have long-term effects (especially if the duration is &gt;30 minutes) such as death, injury, and changes in neuronal tissue depending on the type and duration of the seizure. The human brain consumes a very disproportionate amount of energy given its relatively small size, thus requiring a system capable of balancing cellular oxygen metabolism and brain blood flow control in order to maintain brain oxygen levels. Seizures have been shown to cause changes in oxygen levels beyond the normoxic range, which increases the likelihood that seizure-induced changes in brain pO2 may affect brain function during and after seizures. Decreased oxygenation is common during epileptic seizures. This has been seen on digital pulse oximetry (which measures oxygenation of either the fingers or toes) in the 25-33% saturation range when they have seizures. Such hypoxemia is more common in seizures that are generalized (ie begin as or become generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and/or prolonged.",

      "abstract": "• Although the major classes of antidepressant drugs have been available for over 30 years, clinicians are still unable to predict accurately the response of their depressed patients to medication. This article reviews both clinical and biologic predictors of treatment response and makes recommendations for future studies. The tricyclic antidepressants remain the drugs of choice in major depressive disorders. Lithium has a place in bipolar depressions. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have a role in depressions accompanied by marked anxiety and/or panic symptoms, in patients who have previously responded to them, and as a second-choice treatment in those depressed patients who have not responded to tricyclic antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy or additional antipsychotic drugs are frequently necessary in very severe and delusional depressions. Biologic predictors of response, despite some interesting leads that may in the long term be of considerable importance, are not yet sufficiently established to be of routine clinical usefulness, although either dexamethasone nonsuppression or a shortened rapid eye movement latency may identify depressed patients who require biologic treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "title": "Psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in “Long <scp>COVID</scp> ”: the relevance of immunopsychiatry",
      "abstract": "Although precise estimations of the absolute risk are still difficult to provide, it is clear that depression and anxiety are predominant symptoms in post-acute COVID-19, and that they are more pronounced in patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 than in those hospitalized for other respiratory tract infections1. Also, cognitive impairment has been reported in several people who have had symptomatic COVID-19 infection, which can manifest as difficulties with concentration, memory, receptive language and/or executive function1. Psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment can develop and persist months after the infection and are therefore part of what is called the \"Long COVID\" condition, of which fatigue is another paramount manifestation. The development of depression and anxiety symptoms and of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 may partly be the result of somatic, functional or psychosocial consequences of the disease. Coronaviruses can also induce cognitive, emotional, neurovegetative and behavioral dysregulation due to direct neurological injury through hypoxic damage and neuroinvasion. In addition to this, the systemic immune activation seen in COVID-19 can contribute significantly to the mental health toll even months after the initial disease. COVID-19 disease has been characterized as a cytokine release syndrome2. Elevated serum concentrations of interleukin-6 and other inflammatory cytokines are hallmarks, and correlate in a dose-response manner with respiratory failure, adverse respiratory distress syndrome, and other clinical outcomes. Immuno-inflammatory dysregulation can contribute importantly to acute and post-acute psychiatric and cognition symptoms in COVID-19 patients. To illustrate, various lines of research indicate a link between immune activation and depression. First, manipulation of the immune system through endotoxin, interferon-alpha or typhoid vaccine interventions induces sickness behavior involving depressive symptoms such as fatigue, low mood and hypersomnia. Second, large-scale studies confirmed that persons with auto-immune conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, or with inflammation-inducing conditions, e.g. obesity, have an increased risk to subsequently develop depression. Third, meta-analyses of biomarker studies indicate that levels of inflammatory markers, including cytokines – such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 – and acute phase proteins – such as C-reactive protein (CRP) – are significantly elevated in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. Low-grade systemic inflammation has also been shown to induce robust pathophysiological abnormalities in the endocrine systems of stress and arousal regulation that further augment neuroimmune reactivity. In addition, human and animal studies indicate that peripheral immune activation is able to induce brain inflammation, and increased inflammatory responses have been indeed reported in post-mortem brain samples of depressed individuals. Moreover, large-scale genome-wide DNA and RNA studies indicate that depressed persons have more genetic variants and enriched gene expression pathways involved in immune signaling. Such genetic pleiotropy between immuno-inflammatory dysregulation and depression may indicate a genetic vulnerabil­ity that might partly explain why persons with a mood disorder history have a higher risk of unfavorable COVID-19 disease outcomes as compared to persons without a psychiatric history3. Fi­nally, anti-inflammatory medication approaches have demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression symptoms. Of note, findings suggesting a pathophysiological link to the immune system have also been reported for other dimensions relevant to COVID-19, such as cognitive impairment and fatigue. In a population-representative cross-sectional analysis of >40,000 adults, a higher CRP level was associated with poorer executive functioning, which was especially true in the presence of depression and even existed in early adulthood4. Longitudinally, high levels of inflammatory markers have been linked to long-term cognitive decline, involving deterioration of memory and executive function5. A proteome-wide association study of older-adult brain donors indicated increased inflammation in brains of cognitively impaired persons as compared to those of cognitive stable persons6. For fatigue, illustration of immune system involvement comes most strongly from studies of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), a condition characterized by persistent, unexplained fatigue that is not alleviated by rest. Although CFS/ME has long been indicated as a mystery illness, recent studies suggest that inflammation is central to its pathogenesis in at least a considerable proportion of patients, as suggested by higher levels of inflammatory markers that show a dose-response relationship to disease severity7. If even low-grade systemic immune activity increases the risk of depression, cognitive impairment and fatigue, it is obvious that we need to be aware of the role that immune activation can play in the mental health consequences of COVID-19, which involves a massive cytokine storm. A dose-response relationship has been indeed documented between the severity of immune-inflammatory dysregulation in COVID-19 patients and depressive symptomatology three months later8. The same study also reported that high baseline inflammation load in COVID-19 patients predicted neurocognitive impairment – involving reduced processing speed, verbal memory and fluency – after three months. How long the impact of immune activation in COVID-19 patients persists remains to be clarified. However, for infections involving hospital contact, the maximum behavioral effects can take over a year post-infection to fully develop. This suggests that, next to the immediate impact, there may also be priming whereby immune activation triggered by infection (i.e., first hit) may progressively increase sensitivity to common pro-inflammatory stimuli (i.e., second hit), which include other mild infections, concussions, airborne allergen and pollutant exposure, as well as psychosocial stressors. Future research goals are to examine how to best monitor, prevent and treat psychiatric, behavioral and cognitive consequences of COVID-19. For clinicians treating depression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a thorough history and clinical examination are paramount. There is evidence that immune-inflammatory dysregulation is limiting the efficacy of antidepressants, as high plasma levels of CRP and interleukins have been found to be predictors of poor treatment response9. Consequently, whether antidepressants are effective in treating COVID-19-related depression deserves specific confirmation. In the meantime, we can assume that any major advances in vaccines and antiviral treatments targeting SARS-CoV-2, as well as immune targeted therapies (such as anti-cytokines and cytokine receptor blockers), will not only prevent severe illness but also benefit the brain and mental health.",

Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

MDMA reduces the level of these neurotransmitters within the neural synapses by reducing the number of intraneural transporters to the synaptic clefts, increasing deactivation with the synapse and/ or increasing degradation with the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Users may have varied reasons for MDMA use and therefore require help and support from their families or friends, and knowledgeable and well-skilled healthcare professionals for successful abstinence, avoidance of further psychological damage and a reversal of adverse health effects or reduction in their severity.",

This article presents converging findings from human behavioral research, brain imaging, and basic neuroscience on smoking as self-medication for attentional and emotional dysfunctions. Nicotine and other tobacco constituents have significant effects on neural circuitry underlying the regulation of attention and affect. Age, sex, early environment, and exposure to other drugs have been identified as important factors that moderate both the effects of nicotine on brain circuitry and behavior and the risk for smoking initiation. Findings also suggest that the effects of smoking differ depending on whether smoking is used to regulate attention or affect. Individual differences in the reinforcement processes underlying tobacco use have implications for the development of tailored smoking cessation programs and prevention strategies that include early treatment of attentional and emotional dysfunctions.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Unawareness of the meaning of these symptoms often mislead both the patient and his physician.To define and describe the types of visual illusions and hallucinations which can be commonly encountered in neuro-ophthalmological practice.Overview article.Hallucinations are a perception not based on sensory input, whereas illusions are a misinterpretation of a correct sensory input. Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms. Then, careful visual function examination should provide a good insight in the location of the lesion.",

These desirable changes consist in increased extraversion, decreased preoccupation with self and decreased sensitivity to the opinions of others. With restricted operations, undesirable changes-the \"frontal lobe syndrome\"-do not occur. OPERATIVE FAILURES ARE DUE TO THREE MAIN CAUSES: (a) Preoperative emotional deterioration; (b) progress of the underlying disease; (c) relapse, possibly due to inadequate operation. Lobotomy is advisable if the patient does not show sustained improvement after a year of active treatment by other indicated means. The operation often represents the turning point in effective treatment. After the first year of ineffective treatment valuable time is being lost, with danger of fixation and deterioration. Then it is safer to operate than to wait. The future of psychosurgery lies in prompt application, in favorable patients, of selective operations that will reverse the trend of illness. There is particular need for further exploration of the temporal lobes in the hope of finding some procedure that will suppress hallucinations. Some 90 per cent of patients remaining in hospitals after psychosurgery are experiencing hallucinations. If these phenomena can be eliminated without producing serious personality defects, another large field for the application of psychosurgery will be opened.",

      "title": "Mutism as a Complication of Total Intravenous Anesthesia by Propofol",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: We read with interest the recent case report by Kati et al. (1). The authors describe a 56-year-old woman who developed somnolence and mutism for 11 days postoperatively, after total intravenous anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium for a femur fracture fixation. The authors concluded that this neurologic complication may be attributed to an unknown effect of propofol. We think another possible explanation for the symptoms described in the case may have been a presentation of central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS). The signs and symptoms of CAS are similar to those described with atropine overdose and consist of somnolence, confusion, amnesia, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia, delirium, stupor, or coma in addition to tachycardia, dry mouth, dry skin, visual disturbances, and dysarthria (2). CAS occurs when drugs occupy central cholinergic sites leading to insufficient release of acetylcholine (2). CAS has been linked to many drugs including atropine sulfate, hyoscine, promethazine, benzodiazepines, opioids, halothane, and ketamine (3). CAS has also been described after propofol anesthesia (4) and even after nitrous oxide withdrawal (5). In animal studies, it has been shown that fentanyl has strong affinity for muscarinic receptors, whereas morphine and alfentanil do not exhibit any affinity for muscarinic receptors (6). Since the patient in the presented case received propofol, fentanyl, and atropine during anesthesia, we feel that CAS is a distinct possibility. CAS symptoms may last from hours to days (7). The diagnosis of CAS is made by exclusion, after ruling out other causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia and by a positive therapeutic response to physostigmine, a centrally active anticholinesterase agent. The incidence of CAS during the postoperative period has been reported to be up to 9.4% after general anesthesia and 3.3% after regional anesthesia with sedation (2). In a prospective study of 962 patients by Link et al. (8), 18 patients developed the syndrome, all of whom responded promptly to physostigmine administration. Katsanoulas et al. (9), reported two cases in which a delay in diagnosis of CAS resulted in unanticipated intensive care admission and acute lung injury. We suggest that the diagnosis of CAS should be considered in all patients, including the one in the case report by Kati et al. (1), who demonstrate abnormal postanesthetic awakening. Additionally, physostigmine should be readily available (10) and administered perioperatively in situations where the possibility of this diagnosis is considered.

      "abstract": "Mercury exists in various chemical forms. The important forms from a toxicological viewpoint are the metallic form, also called the elemental form, the divalent inorganic forms and methylmercury compounds. Elemental (Hg0) mercury has a high vapor pressure and the vapor causes a number of cases of poisoning via inhalation. Classical mercury poisoning is characterized by a triad of signs, namely tremors, erethism and gingivitis. Mercurial erethism, which is characterized by behavioral and personality changes such as extreme shyness, excitability, loss of memory, and insomnia are also observed. Recently, the effects of mercury exposure at levels around 0.05 mg/m3 or lower have been of concern and may include minor renal tubular damage, increased complaints of tiredness, memory disturbance and other symptoms, subclinical finger tremor, abnormal EEG by computerized analysis and impaired performance in neurobehavioral or neuropsychological tests. Abnormal gait, dysarthria, ataxia, deafness and constriction of the visual field are typical of the symptoms of methylmercury poisoning observed in Minamata and Iraqi outbreaks, as well as in occupational methylmercury poisoning cases. Furthermore, an infant born to a mother with excessive methylmercury consumption showed various neurological disturbances and delayed development. Since several populations are believed to be still exposed to methylmercury through the consumption of fish and sea mammals, neurobehavioral deviations in children of these populations have recently been investigated.",

      "abstract": "Les psychédéliques, souvent appelés hallucinogènes, sont une classe de psychotropes très singulière. Les effets subjectifs et comportementaux qu’ils induisent sont très impressionnants, et malgré leur toxicité potentielle, le risque d’addiction est relativement faible par rapport à la nicotine, l’alcool ou les opiacés. Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques. Cette revue explorera la littérature concernant les effets de ces différents composés sur les neurotrophines, ainsi que les adaptations plastiques qui sont mises en place dans les heures et jours suivant l’administration, afin de comprendre leur potentiel thérapeutique étonnant.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure.

      "title": "Sucht und Demenz",
      "abstract": "Regelmäßiger Konsum führt bei vielen Drogen zu leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen, die unter Abstinenz noch einige Zeit fortbestehen können, aber zum großen Teil reversibel sind. Zum neuropsychologischen Vollbild einer Demenz wie auch zu bleibenden strukturellen Hirnschädigungen kommt es hingegen nur selten. Die größten Risiken dauerhafter struktureller Hirnschäden bergen Kokain, Amphetamine und Ecstasy, geringer ist die Gefahr bei Benzodiazepinen, Cannabis und Opiaten. Selbst beim Alkohol ist unklar, inwieweit die reine Alkoholwirkung zu irreversiblen Hirnschäden führt. Dies ist offenbar nur bei dauerhaften sehr hohen Blut-Alkohol-Konzentrationen der Fall, wahrscheinlich wirken häufig Entzugsyndrome verschlimmernd. Bedeutsamer sind die vielfältigen Alkoholfolge- bzw. -begleiterkrankungen. Dasselbe trifft für das Rauchen und Opiate zu. Beim Wernicke-Korsakoff-Syndrom und der HIV-Enzephalopathie handelt es sich nicht um direkte Folgen des Suchtmittels, sondern um indirekte Komplikationen. Die Wernicke-Enzephalopathie verläuft oft oligosymptomatisch bzw. mit „atypischen“ Symptomen, so dass sie sehr häufig nicht erkannt wird und dann unbemerkt in ein Korsakoff-Syndrom mündet. Suchtmittelkonsum und Sucht-Folgeerkrankungen können auf verschiedene Weise im Sinne der zerebralen Multimorbidität zur Entwicklung degenerativer Demenzerkrankungen beitragen. Diese Rolle des Alkoholmissbrauchs als Kofaktor ist epidemiologisch offenbar am wichtigsten, sie wird die mit zunehmendem Alter immer bedeutsamer. Geringfügiger bis mäßiger Alkoholkonsum ist nicht mit einem erhöhten Demenzrisiko verbunden. Schwerwiegender als die kognitiven Einbußen sind möglicherweise die Beeinträchtigungen der Lernfähigkeit durch chronischen Drogeneinfluss, die soziales Lernen, den Erwerb von Copingmechanismen und Stressbewältigungsfertigkeiten behindern und damit zu Persönlichkeitsveränderungen beitragen. Dies gilt bei Langzeitanwendung wohl auch für Benzodiazepine in therapeutischen Dosierungen. Die Gefahren sind umso größer, je jünger und unreifer das Gehirn ist. Außerdem besteht eine deutliche Beziehung zur kumulativen Dosis.",

He presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms primarily slurring of speech, ataxia followed by delusion and hallucinations which resolved within 2 weeks with parenteral thiamine and an antipsychotic. Symptoms reappeared after a re-exposure, this time with more prominent psychiatric symptoms which were late to resolve (4 weeks) with similar treatment. Neuroimaging revealed hyperintensities in posterior regions of the brain which resolved after 4 weeks. The patient had prominent neurocognitive deficits which were persistent.

      "abstract": "‘If I can’t feel, if I can’t move, if I can’t think, and I can’t care, then what conceivable point is there in living?’ (Kay Redfield Jamison, An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness) Mood is a person’s subjective emotional state. According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

However, the sensation of breathlessness can also accompany anxiety with somatic symptoms that are troublesome and sometimes disabling. Symptoms are often out of proportion to physical findings, test results often normal, and may decrease substantially when the patient is asleep or distracted. The most common presentations of functional dyspnea include vocal cord dysfunction, hyperventilation, sighing dyspnea, and overbreathing or hyperventilation during exercise. These symptoms are most often confused with poorly controlled asthma resulting in overtreatment with asthma medications, including corticosteroids. After a judicious workup for \"organic\" cardiopulmonary disease, specific testing may help differentiate these disorders. These include specialized cardiopulmonary testing, provocation tests, and standardized and validated questionnaires. Identification of functional dyspnea can then facilitate short-term intervention and/or psychological evaluation and treatment.",

While physical dependence is linked to withdrawal syndrome, psychic dependence, on the Author's opinion, is related to a long-standing previous state of true or masked endogenous depression (in this case it would be well termed as \"neuropsychological dependence\"), and the drug taking is only a maladaptive self-medication. This thesis is substantiated by the literature, reporting, in chronic drug addicts the use of the whole series of antidepressants (i.e. tricyclics, doxepine, lithium, etc.), with noticeable therapeutical success. According with other reports and with personal experience, the Authors maintain a great importance to drugs acting, directly or not, on GABA, i.e. l-glutamine, piracetam, and, particularly, N-dipropilacetic acid.",

      "title": "Sedation with Antipsychotics: Manage, Don't Accept Adverse 'Calming' Effect",
      "abstract": "Sedation is a frequent side effect of antipsychotics, especially at relatively high doses. Antipsychotics' sedative effects can reduce agitation in acute psychosis and promote sleep in insomnia, but long-term sedation may: [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] * interfere with schizophrenia patients' efforts to go to work or school or engage in normal socialization * prevent improvement from psychosocial training, psychiatric rehabilitation, and other treatments. This article discusses how to manage acute psychosis without oversedation and ways to address persistent sedation and chronic insomnia with less-sedating antipsychotics or adjunctive medications. Neurobiology or psychopharmacology? Many patients experience only mild, transient somnolence at the beginning of antipsychotic treatment, and most develop some tolerance to the sedating effects with continued administration. Others may have persistent daytime sedation that interferes with normal functioning. Sedation is especially common in elderly patients receiving antipsychotics. Compared with younger patients, older patients receiving the same doses of the same medications become more heavily sedated for longer periods of time. The resulting sedation can impair arousal levels during the day and increase the risk of falls. Sedation can occur with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), but it is seen more commonly and tends to be more severe with low-potency FGAs than with SGAs. Clinical challenges come with: * distinguishing between sedation and negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, amotivation, withdrawal, and anhedonia * determining whether an individual's cognitive impairment is related to the antipsychotic's sedative properties. Because the treatments are different, it is important to try to distinguish negative symptoms and/or cognitive impairment related to schizophrenia's neurobiology from sedation related to the antipsychotic. Ask patients if they nap during the day or just lie around, and if they want to do things but can't: * If they want to do things but feel too tired, this likely is sedation caused by the antipsychotic. Treatment might be a dose reduction. * If they are not interested in doing things, the likely cause is negative symptoms. Treatment might be a medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. * If they want to do things but cannot organize themselves to be able to do them, this likely is cognitive impairment. Treatment might be cognitive training or remediation. Efficacy and sedation Antipsychotics are thought to exert their effect by antagonism of postsynaptic dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2A receptors and possibly other receptors in the brain. Four SGAs--risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone--act as dopamine D2 and 5HT2A antagonists. Aripiprazole is a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5HT1A partial agonist, and serotonin 5HT2A antagonist. (1) Efficacy data comparing SGAs with each other and with FGAs vary, but all 5 of these SGAs have been shown to be effective antipsychotics. (2-4) They also generally cause less sedation than FGAs. Patients with acute exacerbation of psychosis often have insomnia and frequently report paranoia that something will happen to them while they sleep. When treating agitated patients, many clinicians consider calming effects and true antipsychotic effects to be one in the same, which is not correct. All available antipsychotics are, on average, equally effective in treating acute psychotic symptoms but vary considerably in the amount of sedation they produce. Studies of short-acting injectable SGAs, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, have shown that agitation and acute symptoms can be controlled without significant sedation. (5,6) Antipsychotic effects are not immediate and historically were thought to occur over several weeks. …",

Most clinically important antiseizure medication (ASM) interactions with other drugs result from induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing hepatic enzymes or significant protein binding properties. Other mechanisms, such as pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs, also may plat a role. Because many ASMs are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of hepatic enzymes and do exhibit significant protein binding, drug interactions are common in patients with epilepsy. Patients who have renal or hepatic disorders are especially vulnerable to drug interactions.",

El estudio incluyo historia clinica completa, examenes de laboratorio, interrogatorio sobre habitos y niveles de consumo, y consecuencias sociales del consumo de alcohol. Ademas, se diseno un cuestionario para la identificacion temprana de los bebedores que abusan del alcohol en forma excesiva. Se encontro que el consumo excesivo de alcohol esta asociado con numerosos signos y sintomas relacionados con el aparato cardiovascular, el digestivo y el sistema nervioso central, incluyendo la esfera mental. Asimismo, que estas manifestaciones producen, con cierta frecuencia, confusion en el medico y son atribuidas a otros procesos patologicos. La aplicacion del cuestionario, denominado AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), permitio establecer ciertos indicadores clinicos de las fases tempranas de consumo peligroso de alcohol; de ellos destacan: insomnio y/o ansiedad, temblor distal de miembros superiores, trastornos digestivos vagos, accidentes frecuentes, impuntualidad en el trabajo y/o ausentismo laboral, tension nerviosa sin causa aparente, elevacion de la gamaglutamil-transferasa, aumento del volumen globular medio, macrocitosis sin anemia y aumento de lipoproteinas de alta densidad. El analisis de estos resultados demostro que el AUDIT es un instrumento de tamizaje altamente sensible (80%) y especifico (89%), con un valor promedio predictivo positivo de 60% y un valor promedio predictivo negativo de 95%.

Side effects can be present, but do not warrant to stop the treatment; meanwhile there are signs of intoxication which necessitate immediate treatment interruption. This medication should be given to motivated patients, of normal intelligence, suffering from repeated states of mania or melancholia, because it is a long term treatment requiring constant supervision.",

      "abstract": "In the last two decades a growing incidence of a peculiar form of anaphylaxis that only occurs while carrying out physical exercise has been observed. Within the exercise-induced anaphylaxis syndrome two well differentiated clinical forms are included: systemic cholinergic urticaria and exercise-induced anaphylaxis in the strict sense which can be shown by a classic form or a variant form, more uncommon and with manifestations similar to cholinergic urticaria. Postprandial or food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a frequently identified subtype of these last cases. It can be due to an asymptomatic food allergy manifested through physical effort, although in many occasions it is not possible to find a responsible allergen. The diagnosis is settled on the clinical history and specific tests with food allergens. It can be necessary to perform an exercise challenge test with and without previous ingestion. The treatment is preventive and it is based on avoiding the food or the food allergen some hours before the exercise. When it does not depend on foods it is used a prophylactic pharmacotherapy with antihistamines, cromones or sodium bicarbonate. The patient should be well educated on the use of epinephrine in the event of new reactions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders affecting children and adolescents. The diagnostic criteria require the history of one or more depressive episodes in the absence of a history of mania. In contrast to adults, youth may experience predominantly irritable rather than sad mood. The assessment of depression should include a psychiatric evaluation, medical history, and focused laboratory studies to rule out medical and/or substance-related causes. The evaluation should also consider potential precipitants such as recent losses, interpersonal problems, or trauma. The patient should be asked directly about suicidal ideation, plans, and past attempts. Psychotherapy alone or in combination with antidepressant therapy is effective for the treatment of pediatric depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are the most well-studied psychotherapies. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line medication class and should be considered in moderate to severe cases of depression.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% for BD-I, BD-II and sub-threshold types of bipolar disorder (BD). Depressive episodes are more common than manic episodes for many BD patients. Studies show that depressive mood persists in 2/3 of life, even if they are under treatment. It may be difficult to diagnose BD in the event of depression in the first episode. The correct diagnosis and the treatment can be delayed for 6-8 years, and even longer if disorder starts in adolescence. It is reported that 40% of the patients who were initially diagnosed as unipolar were later diagnosed as BD. The features that enable us to diagnose BD depressive episode: 1) family history of BD or psychosis 2) early onset with depression 3) cyclothymic temperament characteristics 4) four or more depressive episodes in 10 years 5) agitation, anger, insomnia, irritability, excessive talkativeness or other 'mixed' or hypomanic features or psychotic symptoms during depressive episode, 6) clinical 'worsening' caused by the appearance of mixed symptoms after AD treatment 7) suicidal thoughts and attempts 8) substance abuse 9) hypersomnia in the depressive episode or sleeping too much during the day, overeating, psychomotor agitation. The number of studies conducted on BD depressive treatment is limited, the information was obtained by excluding this group from the studies or by compiling the information obtained from the treatment of unipolar depression. In this review, acute and maintenance treatment of the depressive episodes of BD will be discussed according to the treatment algorithms.",

      "title": "Mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic used widely as a pediatric or outpatient anesthesia due to its excellent hemodynamic stability and low blood solubility, which allows rapid induction and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as control of the depth of anesthesia. However, when sevoflurane is used alone it is associated with a higher incidence of emergence agitation in children. The rapid removal of residual anesthetics due to low blood solubility of sevoflurane has been suggested to cause emergence agitation in some patients [1,2]. In addition, a variety of other explanations have been proposed for the etiology of emergence agitation. These include the lack of a young child's ability to adapt to sudden changes due to an unfamiliar environment after awakening, immature neurological development, anxiety from being separated from their parents, increased pain sensation and sympathetic hyperactivation [2,3].\r\n\r\nEmergence agitation is characterized by self-limiting aggressive agitation that develops in the early phase of awakening from anesthesia at the end of surgery. Emergence agitation can be dangerous to patients, particularly to young children. Patients suffering from emergence agitation may harm themselves and dislodge drains or catheters, which affects the results of surgery. They may inflict a bodily injury on their care-givers or cause a paranoiac accident, which makes the management and monitoring of patients at the post anesthesia care unit difficult [4]. There have been many attempts to reduce the incidence of emergence agitation but the etiology and preventive treatments of emergence agitation are still unclear.\r\n\r\nSome studies have reported that midazolam which acts on its target effect site GABAA, reduces emergence agitation [5,6], and its antagonist, flumazenil reverses this effect [7]. However, the mechanism is still not clear, and it is not known whether sevoflurane and midazolam interact at the GABAA receptor level. Most GABAA receptors consist of two α subunits, two β subunits and a γ subunit. The γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor exist as a long type (γ2L) and a short type (γ2S), generated by alternative splicing of RNA. The most common pattern for GABAA receptor is α1β2γ2 type, which accounts for 43% of all GABAA receptors [8]. This implies that the diversity of the subtype variants and the distribution of GABAA receptors may affect the anesthetics from subject to subject.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of the Korean journal of anesthesiology, Eom et al. [9] postulated that alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit is related to emergence agitation on the basis of characteristics of midazolam, sevoflurane and γ2 subunit. Sevoflurane binds to GABAA receptor, benzodiazepine-like midazolam prevents emergence agitation and also binds to α and γ subunit of GABAA receptor, and alternative splicing of γ2 subunit is different based on the age of the patient. Whole-cell patch clamp to the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with midazolam and/or sevoflurane was performed. The concentration-response relationships were recorded for midazolam and sevoflurane. They showed that the concentration-response relationships for midazolam and sevoflurane were dose-dependent with no differences between the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S subtypes. It was concluded that the difference in the γ2 subunit cannot explain the emergence agitation of sevoflurane in children in vitro.\r\n\r\nThese finding suggests that co-application of sevoflurane and midazolam enhances the GABA current according to the alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit and concentration of both drugs. Their effort to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia could be a major step towards studying the basic mechanisms of the anesthetic agent. Further study to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation is expected.",

Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts.

      "abstract": "Clinically, olfaction can fail in any of three ways: (i) decreased sensitivity (hyposmia, anosmia) and two types of distortion (dysosmia); (ii) distorted quality of an odorant stimulation (troposmia); (iii) perceived odor when no odorant is present (phantosmia, hallucination). The distortions are usually much more upsetting to a person's quality of life than a simple loss. An ipsilatersal loss of olfactory sensitivity is often identified in the nostril with any type of olfactory distortion. The pathophysiology of a stimulated distortion (troposmia) is likely a decreased number of functioning olfactory primary neurons so that an incomplete characterization of the odorant is made. In phantosmia, two possible causations include an abnormal signal or inhibition from the primary olfactory neurons or peripheral olfactory or trigeminal signals that \"trigger\" a central process. The clinician's goal is to carefully define the problem (e.g. taste versus smell, real versus perceived, one versus two nostrils), to perform the appropriate examination and testing and to provide therapy if possible. Treatment includes assurance with no active therapy (because many of these will naturally resolve), topical medications, systemic medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose and, rarely, referral for surgical excision of olfactory neurons. Endoscopic transnasal operations have the advantage of treating phantosmia and sometimes allowing a return of olfactory ability after the operation.",

Psilocybin and psilocin are the active compounds, responsible for the hallucinogenic effects and are a part of the substance group, derived from tryptamine and characterized by an indole nucleus. We report a clinical case observed in an emergency unit and review the historical, epidemiological and pharmacological data now available for these intoxications. Of particular interests in hallucinogenic mushroom abuse are: increased consumption in the context of youth cultural and entertainment movements; possible difficulties in the diagnosis in emergency conditions; possibility of severe and fatal complications.",

      "abstract": "Aggressiveness is a threatening behavior that results in mental, physical or material harm. It can be directed towards oneself, towards other persons or towards objects / things. Aggression can be expressed physically, verbally or even by neglect. Aggression in individuals depends on various risk factors and factors that influence the dose of aggression and therefore aggressive escalation. As in society and in the population, so do aggressive individuals find themselves in psychiatric wards. There are various psychic conditions that lead to an aggressive act. Schizophrenic patients can act aggressively as well as people who are in an alcohol overdose or people who have been overdosed on opioid substances. Any patient who tries to injure himself, another person, or who tries to cause great material damage shall endeavor to be taken care of by non-punitive or coercive methods. Deescalation procedures based on communication with the patient and using communication skills through which the patient seeks to calm down with words and the atmosphere during communication are cited as non-striking methods. Coercive methods are only used when non-coercive methods have failed. Forcing methods include pharmacological therapy, isolation and physical restraint. Pharmacological therapy involves the appeasement of the patient by administering therapy or medication. Isolation is the process of separating an aggressive patient from other patients from the ward into a specially arranged room where he or she resides until the physician estimates that the patient can return to the room where he or she resides with other patients. Physical restraint is the last phase of coercive methods, it involves the humane physical restraint of the patient with the aim of calming the patient and ceasing to be aggressive. The extremities, head and chest are fixed. The patient is unbound only when the physician determines by psychophysical assessment that the patient no longer needs to be fixed. Education is a very important process in such cases. Educating staff eliminates their possible fear or insecurity and increases the security of all people in the department where aggressive escalation can occur.",

      "title": "The LSD syndrome. A review.",
      "abstract": "lsd (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a powerful bio-active substance related to serotonin in structure. Its actions generally affect autonomic, sensory and psychological functions. Autonomic stimulation is varied. Sensory responses are usually visual, involving heightened and distorted color perception and fusion of sensory impressions. Psychological responses include a feeling that a unique experience is occurring; feelings of depersonalization; pronounced fluctuation of mood; time and space distortions; autistic phenomena; fluctuation of aggressive drives (usually reduction); and spontaneous reoccurrence of the lsd experience. THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES CAN BE RELATED TO THREE BASIC PHENOMENA: (1) expectation; (2) loss of characteristic modes of perceptual and cognitive patterning; and (3) hypersuggestibility. THE MAJOR ADVERSE REACTIONS ARE: (1) chronic drug dependence including subsequent personality changes and depressive reactions; and (2) acute ego dissolution. These reactions usually occur in already emotionally ill people. Most of these users fall into two groups, those with unresolved identity problems and those with severe ego abnormality. The majority of adverse reactions are of the chronic drug dependence type and are usually seen in adolescents and young adults who have not negotiated the age-appropriate tasks of forming and integrating the various identities that are the composite of their life experiences.lsd helps alleviate these stresses via some of its psychological properties as discussed. It also provides a nidus for the formation of a subculture where goals for social, sexual and vocational achievement are lower and idiosyncratic modes of adaptation are better tolerated. A smaller group of users who have serious reactions such as psychosis, rage reactions, homicidal and suicidal ideation are usually found to have preexisting ego abnormality such as ambulatory schizophrenia, chronic impulse disorders and borderline states. Although adverse reactions most often appear to be related to pre-morbid psychopathology, this is not invariably so. Further, there is as yet no reliable method to determine who will have an adverse reaction and what the nature of that reaction will be.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fish stress and mortality can be significant problems in both capture and culture operations. In addition to inexpensive and real‐time metrics, ones that are simple to use are also desirable for measuring fish stress and predicting mortality. Current methods to define stress rely on expensive, laboratory‐based measurements of changes in fish pathology such as disease, necropsy and histology, in physiology such as plasma cortisol, lactate, glucose and ions and in complex behaviour determined from swimming, feeding and predator evasion. All of these methods are often not rigorously linked to fitness outcomes. An alternative is to observe reflex impairment as a direct sign of stress which can be easily and rapidly measured in free swimming or restrained fish responding to peripheral stimuli such as gravity, light, sound and touch. Reflex impairment is correlated with stress and mortality outcomes, eliminating the need for prolonged holding or monitoring of fish. A few examples of reflexes that may be impaired include orientation, startle responses, fin erection, body flex upon restraint, operculum and mouth clamping or gaping, gag response and vestibular–ocular response. Reflex impairment combines the effects of stressors and their interactions and is not dependent on fish size, motivation states and acclimation which make it a consistent sign of stress across a wide range of stressor types and fish ages. Use of reflex impairment to measure stress and predict mortality would significantly improve monitoring of fish health and welfare in many types of field operations such as commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, live transport, stock enhancement and tagging.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Malignant Catatonia: A Review for the Intensivist",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by psychomotor, neurological and behavioral changes. The clinical picture of catatonia ranges from akinetic stupor to severe motoric excitement. Catatonia can occur in the setting of a primary psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder or secondary to a general medical illness like autoimmune encephalitis. Importantly, it can co-occur with delirium or coma. Malignant catatonia describes catatonia that presents with clinically significant autonomic abnormalities including change in temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. It is a life-threatening form of acute brain dysfunction that has several motoric manifestations and occurs secondary to a primary psychiatric condition or a medical cause. Many of the established predisposing and precipitating factors for catatonia such as exposure to neuroleptic medications or withdrawal states are common in the setting of critical illness. Catatonia typically improves with benzodiazepines and treatment of its underlying psychiatric or medical conditions, with electroconvulsive therapy reserved for catatonia refractory to benzodiazepines or for malignant catatonia. However, some forms of catatonia, such as catatonia secondary to a general medical condition or catatonia comorbid with delirium, may be less responsive to traditional treatments. Prompt recognition and treatment of catatonia are crucial because malignant catatonia may be fatal without treatment. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with malignant catatonia, intensivists should familiarize themselves with this important and under-recognized condition.",

The symptoms of this phenomenon contain: sensed presence, fear, visual and auditory hallucinations, unusual body experiences such as out-of-body experience and feelings of floating/paralysis, experiencing a pressure on the thorax, difficulties breathing and a feeling of pain(1). This phenomenon appears to be universal, but has different cultural explanations(2). Objectives We present a case of possible incubus phenomenon to raise awareness about this specific condition. Methods A literature search in English was performed using PubMed with the following mesh term: ‘incubus phenomenon’. Results We present a 29-year old man, known with an intellectual disability (IQ=74), psychotic disorder and a cannabis use disorder. After neurological examination, he was diagnosed with narcolepsy and cataplexy. Over the past weeks there had been an increase of hallucinations that appear before, during or after sleep. The patient’s thoughts included sexual approaches by caregivers, difficulties in breathing and a moving sensation while laying down in bed and experiencing pressure on the thorax assuming a woman was sitting on his chest. Literature search shows a lifetime prevalence of 0.11 % in general population versus 0.41 % in psychiatric patients(2.) Conclusions Literature review shows only a few cases describing the incubus phenomenon. The prevalence is four times higher in patients with a psychiatric history(2) and should not be confused with psychotic disorder. Recognizing is important for proper treatment, as reoccurring attacks can be treated with anxiolytics, antidepressants, anticholinergics or anti-epileptics, and sleep hygiene methods(1.)

It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones).

In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "abstract": "A term with no agreed meaning is as valueless as an experiment with no prior hypothesis. The former is non-communication, the latter is non-science, and the results of both are confusion. The two often coincide in the field of paediatric respiratory medicine, where it is now becoming accepted that the term ‘asthma’, without any qualification or definition, has begun to hinder rather than facilitate progress both in research into the management of wheezy children and in the epidemiological search for the causes of the increasing amount of lower respiratory illness in childhood.1-3 \n\nFirstly, the term is used in several different ways; either generally (or generically) to describe any reversible airway obstruction or specifically to imply symptomatic atopic airway inflammation. Surreptitiously, the two have become confused. Also, it can be used to describe a particular episode of airway obstruction (‘an attack of asthma’) or to mean a tendency to develop recurrent episodes, with the associated prognostic implications. In longstanding asthma, there is often an irreversible component, although strictly, this may fall outside any current definition of the disease.\n\nSecondly, variable airway obstruction in children results from a number of different pathophysiological processes, each of which may have several different causes, and may operate over a variety of timescales. All of these can be labelled ‘asthma’. Two clinical examples illustrate the extremes.\n\n(A) A teenage girl, keen on horses, with multiple atopic features, has troublesome exercise induced asthma, variable airway obstruction which never completely resolves, and daily symptoms. She is relatively resistant to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, has eosinophilia in sputum samples, and is probably destined for a lifetime of disability.\n\n(B) A 14 month old boy, the third child of a non-atopic smoking mother with no history of wheezing, has had three admissions to the local paediatric intensive care …",

High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

      "title": "Syndrome of Transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL): A Case Report - Is there an Association with the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "abstract": "Bartleson, 1981 described the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL) for the first time.[1] HaNDL is classified as a \"headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorder\" and is included in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders.[2] HaNDL, a rare clinical entity, is diagnosed according to the following criteria: (1) episodes of migraine-like headache; (2) accompanied or shortly preceded by the onset of at least one transient neurological deficit lasting >4 h, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (>15 white cells/mL), with negative etiological studies; (3) development or significant worsening of headache and transient neurological deficits in temporal relation to the onset or worsening of the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis or led to its discovery, and/or have significantly improved in parallel with the improvement in the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; and (4) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. The syndrome resolves within 3 months.[2] Although the etiology of HaNDL is not precisely known, based on CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, it is assumed to be associated with an autoimmune or infectious inflammatory disease. Cortical spreading depression may also cause neurologic deficits.[3] CSF lymphocytosis may be accompanied by elevated CSF total protein and CSF pressure that supports possible inflammation. Electroencephalography (EEG) may demonstrate focally abnormal areas consistent with focal neurological deficits. The neurological manifestations include sensory symptoms in approximately three-quarters, aphasia in two-thirds, and motor deficits in a little more than half of the cases.[2] Neurologic adverse events such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are generally mild and transient. One of the most frequent neurological complaints reported after the COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Twenty-eight-year-old female patient with migraine reported to our outpatient clinic with severe headache, speech disturbances, and right-sided sensory symptoms. She had a throbbing pain localized to the left hemisphere, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The migraine attacks occurred once every 2 months and were responsive to simple analgesics. After the second dose of COVID-19 (BNT162b2-BioNTech) vaccination, the frequency and character of headache attacks changed. Distinct severe headaches were noted, and the frequency of headache attacks was increased to 15 days a month with a significantly reduced analgesic response. After 2 months of vaccination, severe headache attacks became chronic and right-sided hemi-hypesthesia and dysarthria appeared. There was no recent viral disease history except for the COVID-19 infection 8 months back during which she had mild symptoms. There was a minimal increase in the frequency of headaches without any change in character. However, dramatic changes occurred post-vaccination. Neurologic examination revealed mild dysarthria, and right hemi-hypesthesia with normoactive tendon reflexes, without any motor disturbance, neck stiffness, meningeal irritation signs, pathological reflexes, or cognitive dysfunction. A detailed blood work-up was performed, including vitamin B12 levels, and serological tests, all of which were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was weakly positive (1/100) in the vasculitis panel. Detailed autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody panels were all negative. Ophthalmological examination revealed no papilledema. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-contrast computerized tomography (CT), MR angiography (MRA), venography, and EEG were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed leukocytic pleocytosis with lymphocytic dominance (45 leukocytes-80% lymphocytes without erythrocytes). CSF opening pressure was 10 cm/CSF and analysis revealed normal protein (40 mg/dL) and normal glucose levels (61 mg/dL-serum: 79 mg/dL). The CSF viral panel, Gram stain, and culture were negative. After the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, HaNDL secondary to the COVID-19 vaccination was diagnosed and was followed closely with symptomatic treatment. The patient's clinical symptoms lasted for approximately 3 weeks and then disappeared spontaneously. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of neurologic deficits despite the occasional headache. There are different views on the etiology of HaNDL syndrome. The presence of inflammatory CSF findings suggests that infection and/or inflammation triggers the condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that viral infection may activate the immune system and cause HaNDL syndrome.[4] The most important finding in support of this hypothesis is that some patients had a viral infection before the onset of symptoms.[5] After infection with COVID-19, persistent or new symptoms may develop for weeks or months, called long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. The symptoms may exceed 12 weeks. Common symptoms in people with long COVID are fatigue, headache, breathlessness, cough, chest pain, myalgia and weakness, insomnia, memory and concentration problems, and worsened quality of life.[6] Although the frequency of the patient's headache increased post-COVID-19 infection, it was vaccine-related rather than infection since the main change in headache character was post-vaccination. A known adverse event of COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Patients with migraine-type headaches develop more headaches after COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls.[7] In BNT162b2 clinical trials (manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer), a higher incidence of headache was noted after the second dose than the first dose, with approximately 52% of patients reporting mild to moderate headaches.[8] In accordance with the literature data, headaches increased in our patients with a history of migraine, particularly after the second vaccination dose. Studies emphasize that the risk of headache after vaccination is increased twice and has a migrainous character in one-third of patients. Although the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced headaches are still unclear, it may be owing to a systemic inflammatory response.[9] Vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA may cause an immunomodulatory response. The immune system stimulation following vaccination induces a strong T-cell response and increases CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.[10] Although the neurological deficit developed in our patient 2 months after the vaccination, there was a significant and constant change in the frequency and character of the headaches immediately post-vaccination. Therefore, the neurological deficit added 2 months later was considered a continuation. In light of all these data and after excluding other differential diagnoses, the COVID-19 vaccination may be considered as a possible cause of HaNDL syndrome by triggering inflammation in our patient. HaNDL should be considered in the differential diagnosis after excluding other probable causes in patients with neurological deficits and headaches post-COVID-19 vaccination.

      "abstract": "In the five thousand years of recorded history there is written evidence of various types of addiction. In recent decades scientists focus their attention on addictions without the immediate introduction of psychoactive substances into the organism or the so-called \"addictions without drugs\". Studies have revealed a number of similarities between drug addictions and addictions without drugs that also carry biological, psychological and social consequences in the form of addictive activity carvings, adrenaline alarm, dopamine and serotonin secretion, tolerance and abstinence syndrome same as classical forms of addiction. Although the physiological effect of addiction without drugs on the brain and nervous system is not yet sufficiently explored, scientists have found equivalent effects on addicts suffering from one or the other type of addiction. These addicts are almost generally dysfunctional persons who become prisoners of their own passions, and the consequences are numerous technological advantages offered by modern times and in some respects a punishment due to the civilization for forgetting the man himself. Considering that most people, so and many psychiatrist, often accept these addictions as a lifestyle and without any delay and awareness of the potential dangers they may pose, we can with certainty say that the so-called \"addictions without drugs\" are the scourge of the 21st century. With pathological gambling, which is as old as human civilization, in recent decades we meet the growing problems of internet addiction, gambling games, which are classified for the first time at DSM V in addictive disorder, uncontrolled shopping, food cravings, addiction to sex, weight loss, sports, work and many more, which are mostly true addictions, and not only the way of life. The aim of this paper is to point to the growing problem of addiction without drugs, which is becoming an increasing problem within our community.",

These comorbid conditions may include medical diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis; nonspecific symptoms such as pain, fatigue, or insomnia; psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse; or tak-ing multiple medications with multiple side ef-fects. Second, older adults are more likely to pre-sent with chronic rather than acute conditions. The chronic nature of these conditions renders them more complex and potentially less amena-ble to treatment. Third, the goals of care often are more appropriately focused on functional in-dependence than longevity or cure. Diagnostic strategies, intervention, and treatments that might be appropriate for younger patients may be inap-propriate for any given older adult if they lower current quality of life to obtain uncertain long-term benefits. Fourth, negotiating goals of care of-ten involves not only the patient, but also family caregivers, other health care professionals involved in the patient’s treatments, and even third-party payers.",

      "title": "Narcotic Poisoning of Children (1) Through Accidental Ingestion of Methadone and (2) <i>in utero</i>",
      "abstract": "Narcotics have been known to man since prehistoric times, and they continue to be among the most used analgesics in the practice of medicine. They comprise a group of drugs whose analgesic effect is coupled with euphoria and somnolence. In addition, their spasmogenic effect on smooth muscle has made them useful agents in the alleviation of certain gastrointestinal tract symptoms. For most narcotics, therapeutic dosage does not produce serious untoward effects. Unfortunately, they have a depressant effect on respiration by directly influencing the respiratory center of the brain. This may be life threatening when recommended dosages are exceeded. Narcotics have been abused since the recognition that they can induce euphoria and a feeling of well being. Tolerance and physical and psychological dependence result from their repeated use. The occurrence of withdrawal symptomatology in humans using these drugs repeatedly helps to produce a pattern of drug dependence; an individual has but to repeat a dose of drug in order to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Abuse liability is thus great. All narcotics share this addiction potential. Those most frequently prescribed in clinical medicine are morphine, trieperidine, codeine and methadone. Heroin (diacetylmorphine), the most commonly abused narcotic, available only illicitly, is not prescribed in clinical practice. After injection, it is hydrolyzed to morphine which produces its pharmacological action. While morphine and heroin are absorbed only following parenteral administration, some narcotics are absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal tract as well as after injection (methadone, codeine, meperidine). Regardless of the mode of administration, narcotics taken by a pregnant addict readily pass the placental barrier and are capable of producing effects on the infant in utero and after birth.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Delirium is a highly prevalent neuropsychiatric syndrome. It is defined by acute disturbance in attention, a change in cognition, or a perceptual derangement. Delirium can be precipitated by any somatic factor, which includes a variety of different illnesses, surgery, or substance (medication) intoxication or withdrawal. Predisposing factors are higher age and cognitive and functional impairment, among others. A final common pathway seems to be the most plausible for this multifactorial syndrome. The current leading candidate for the final pathway is the neurotransmitter state of relative acetylcholine deficiency and dopamine excess, together with an exaggerated inflammatory cascade. Although prevention of delirium should be the main aim, treatment consists of non-pharmacologic measures, reversing the precipitating conditions, and judicious use of antipsychotics in severely agitated patients only. Delirium is independently associated with an increase in mortality, impaired physical and cognitive recovery, and increased hospital costs.",

      "abstract": "The loss of motivation is frequent in aged person and sometimes is difficult to assess. It is associated with depression but not exclusively. It overlaps with frontal brain aging consequences. Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse. Because of the variability in the symptoms produced by SC use, clinicians are encouraged to consider SC use in the diagnostic evaluation.",

The second phenomenon:An abnormality of vision of peripheral oscillopsia, persisting from the time of the same acute-fear experience. The third phenomenon: A high probability of stepwise simultaneous elimination of both visual phenomena follows the maneuver of repeatedly exposing each voluntarily evoked visual-image and other sensory memory to volitional rapid side-to-side eye movements, as per one aspect of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.This maneuver leaves the memory stored and recalled normally (i.e., nonexperientially) and vision oscillopsia-free. Clinical features of patients with the visual phenomena are unique to each patient.The authors report further observations over 25 years on the wide spectra of difficulty, intensity, and/or obtrusiveness of each of the three visual phenomena and of three closely related clinical features. Relevant clinical findings pertaining to the visual phenomena in 100 recent consecutively referred patients are reported.The strong inference of these observations induces a schema: a further refinement of the construct posttraumatic stress disorder, together with a visual state marker.",

      "abstract": "Endosulfan is a highly toxic agricultural pesticide that has been banned in many countries due to its significant neurotoxicity and environmental persistence. Accidental or intentional ingestion by humans induces severe neurological symptoms, which frequently culminate in coma or death. Forensic evaluation of suspected endosulfan toxicity cases can be challenging, given that endosulfan residue may not be detectable in the blood or tissues at the time of death. As such, evaluation of the case history in the context of the reported literature becomes extremely important. Although acute endosulfan toxicity in adults has been well documented, pediatric cases are rare within the literature. Here we present the case of a toddler who accidentally ingested an unknown quantity of endosulfan from an unmarked water bottle on his family farm. The child developed rapid-onset neurological symptoms, including vomiting and seizures, followed by coma. Despite medical intervention, the child was eventually pronounced brain dead and taken off life support. Autopsy revealed massive cerebral edema and its sequelae (sutural diastasis, pituitary necrosis, and dural venous thromboses), and pulmonary thromboemboli. Endosulfan was detected in the bottle from which the child drank. As endosulfan was not detectable in postmortem blood, the cause of death was certified based upon the totality of available information including history, consistency of the case history with the clinical presentation, and the autopsy findings.",

Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

      "abstract": "Mood may be considered the module of the human mind, which has evolved to tune the activity ofthe organism to the specific environmental conditions in a better way. In some cases depression may be adaptive, for example in aborting the activity associated with too many obstacles. At the same time hypomania may be related to the capability of mobilising the organism to gain many resources in a short period of time. Severe mood disorders may be related to the genetic variants, eg. of the serotonin transporter or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which in several situations may give some evolutionary advantage. Affective temperaments, observed in the relatives of patients with affective disorders may be associated with some benefits in the social life. The relationship between early adversities and adult depression may be related to the phenomenon of the stress axis programming, which has deep evolutionary roots. Some infectious factors may cause behaviours similar to the affective symptoms, which may increase their reproductive success. The evolutionary perspective, which is complementary to the current etiopathogenic theories may help in understanding, why genes and traits which",

      "abstract": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an illness in which a person can present with acutely altered mentation, drowsiness or sometimes stupor, visual impairment (e.g., visual hallucinations, cortical blindness, hemianopia, quadrantanopia, and diplopia), seizures (focal or general tonic-clonic), and sudden or constant, non-localized headaches. PRES can unfold acutely or subacutely, with symptoms developing within hours to days. Often, the presentation occurs in the context of acute uncontrolled hypertension, with systolic blood pressures ranging between 160 to 190 mmHg. The name designated to this clinical and radiographic syndrome is inspired from (1) radiographic findings of white matter edema (i.e., hyperintense T2 signal or hypointense T1 signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), typically found in the posterior cerebrum in a symmetric fashion (although asymmetric presentations are possible); and (2) the fact that symptoms are reversible, provided that the syndrome is recognized and treated promptly. However, the name used to describe the syndrome is misleading because the edema is not localized necessarily to the posterior cerebrum white matter and can appear in watershed zones other than parietal-occipital regions thalamus, and sometimes in the anterior circulation. Moreover, the syndrome is not always reversible. Some individuals can develop life-threatening complications, such as transforaminal cerebellar herniation and focal neurologic deficits, especially if prompt treatment is not initiated.",

Ceux qui s'étaient entaillés le poignet étaient plus jeunes et leurs actes étaient d'une létalité plus faible. Ils sont peu susceptibles d'avoir déjà posé des gestes suicidaires. Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation. La réaction typique est la suivante: une fois la blessure infligée, et après une période de dépersonnalisation suivit de détente et de repersonnalisation provoquée par le saignement, le patient n'éprouve aucune douleur.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic patients can be affected by a wide range of peripheral nerve disorders, the rarer of which are often poorly recognised and understood. “Insulin neuritis” or “treatment induced neuropathy” is a reversible disorder characterised by acute severe distal limb pain, peripheral nerve fibre damage and autonomic dysfunction, preceded by a period of rapid glycaemic control. The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

In addition, it briefly discusses the mental status changes that may occur at high altitudes. With mild hypoxia, lowered levels of blood oxygen may produce symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, clumsiness, and poor judgment. Patients may behave as if they are intoxicated. When individuals remain at very high altitudes for long periods of time, mental status changes may ensue. Changes in mental state, however, may be prominent, signaling a gradually developing or worsening hypoxia. Worsening hypoxia or anoxia will lead to loss of consciousness and may cause irreversible brain damage or death. Patients with chronic lung disorders are especially sensitive to inadequate ventilation during anesthesia. Individuals with sleep apnea are at risk for hypoxia during the night.",

Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

It influences the prevalence of depression phenotypes: melancholic, anxious, primarily somatic, or highly externalized “masculine depression.” External stigma of depression is universal, but its details are culture-dependent. The acceptability and feasibility of specific treatments vary by culture. Before prescribing against a patient’s culturally based biases, a clinician should consider not only medication and psychotherapy but also lifestyle or environmental changes; complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine; antidepressant smartphone apps; light therapy; and non-invasive brain stimulation. Depression biomarkers soon may have a role in selection of treatments that are both culturally compatible and likely to work.",

      "title": "Alternative and Complementary Modalities for Managing Stress and Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Stress is endemic in our society. More than two thirds of office visits to physicians are for stress-related illnesses, such as heart disease, anxiety disorders, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, cancer, respiratory disorders, accidental injuries, cirrhosis of the liver, and attempted suicide, all of which are leading causes of death in the United States. In addition to causing illness, stress can aggravate other conditions such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, herpes, mental illness, alcoholism, drug abuse, and family discord and violence. Stress is not always adverse, however; managed correctly, the problems caused by stress can be minimized. Realistically, stress is a normal aspect of life that must be endured at some level. Additionally, a stress response can be helpful in many ways, motivating persons to work or study or increasing their alertness while taking a test or giving a talk. The problem occurs when stress exceeds a productive level and interferes with the ability to think, remember, and focus on tasks. Stress that is ineffectively managed and remains too high for too long can contribute to multiple illnesses.Americans are using alternative and complementary therapies, often for stress-related complaints. The results of a nationwide survey of 1539 adults published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 1 in 3 Americans uses therapies considered unconventional.1 This study was the landmark investigation that opened the floodgates to exploring and understanding these new therapies and how they work. The most frequently used therapies mentioned in the survey were relaxation techniques, chiropractic, massage therapy, imagery, spiritual healing, lifestyle diets, herbal medicine, mega-vitamin therapy, self-help groups, energy healing, biofeedback, hypnosis, homeopathy, acupuncture, folk remedies, exercise, and prayer. A 1997 follow-up national survey2 by the same team found that use of at least 1 of 16 alternative therapies during the preceding year increased from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997. Overall, use of alternative therapies increased by 25%, total visits to alternative medicine practitioners increased by 47%, and expenditures for alternative goods and services increased by 45% (exclusive of inflation). Results from the follow-up study also indicated that ailing persons most often seek nonmainstream treatments for chronic conditions, such as back problems, anxiety, depression, and headaches. In 1990, an estimated 3 in 10 Americans used at least one alternative therapy; in 1997, the rate was 4 in 10 Americans. Of additional interest, the increased use does not appear to be linked to any particular sociodemographic group.2 Another researcher3 found that compared with nonusers, the majority of users of alternative medicine were more educated and reported poorer health status. They used the alternative therapies not so much as a result of being dissatisfied with conventional medicine, but largely because they found that these healthcare alternatives were more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.3 Indeed, many acute care nurses are becoming aware of ways to incorporate complementary modalities to combat the effects of stress.Q: What exactly is stress and what causes it?The term stress refers to a heightened physical or mental state produced by a change in the internal or external environment. In humans, physical stress is caused by injuries or illnesses and psychological stress by real, perceived, or anticipated threats. Whether stress arises from a cause perceived by sense organs that relay the danger to the brain or from mental actions such as worry or fear, the course of events can be the same.Q: What is the relationship between stress and the body’s hormonal system?When an event such as hospitalization for a patient or environmental work conditions for a staff member is perceived as threatening by the higher cortical centers, signals are sent to the motor cortex and hypothalamus. Several hormones are released from the pituitary and adrenal glands, resulting in a number of physiological manifestations that can produce further harm to already compromised systems.Q: What are some of the symptoms or manifestations of stress?Stress shows itself in 3 general areas: physical, social, and psychological. Physical signs of stress includeSocial manifestations of stress include family conflicts, job tensions, and change in sexual energy. Psychological signs of stress are 3-fold (Table 1). Any patient or staff member with subjective or objective signs of stress is a candidate for one or more stress-reduction therapies.Q: How do you define alternative and complementary therapies?An alternative therapy is one that is used instead of a conventional or mainstream therapy. For example, acupuncture is an alternative therapy. A complementary therapy may be an alternative therapy, but becomes complementary when used in conjunction with conventional therapy. It helps to potentiate the effect of the conventional therapy. For example, massage, which can stand alone as an alternative therapy, can also be used in conjunction with conventional regimens for a variety of problems.Q: What are some of the specific alternative and complementary therapies that you find helpful to counteract stress?Many different therapies that everyone can enjoy are available. See Table 2 for a brief description of the most widely used, evidence-based therapies; for more information, see Holistic Nursing: A Handbook for Practice.4Q: What is the research that validates use of these therapies?All of these modalities have research results to back them up. That is why the therapies in Table 2 are so popular. Let’s take a look at a couple of them individually.Low back pain is one of the most common chronic conditions. In a study5 with a random sample of 50 patients with low-back pain who received spa therapy and 52 who received standard ambulatory care, the findings for the 2 groups were significantly different. Compared with the patients who did not have spa therapy, patients who had the therapy had a significant improvement in spin mobility and in functional scores and a reduction in the daily duration of pain. Assessment of the long-term effects 9 months after therapy showed continued reduction in pain and drug consumption and improvement in spine mobility among the patients who had spa therapy.5Another study6 consisted of 25 randomly selected patients in a hospital setting who had pain from fibromyalgia. Twelve patients had hydrogalvanic baths, and 13 had Jacobson relaxation training. Different dimensions of pain were measured at the beginning and the end of therapy. Patients receiving bath therapy had a significantly greater decrease in pain intensity from breakfast to lunch than did patients who received the Jacobson relaxation therapy.6 Numerous other studies are detailed in the book Healing Waters.7In a study8 of 122 patients in an intensive care unit, 3 therapies were compared for their effects on increasing the quality of sensory input that patients receive and reducing patients’ levels of stress and anxiety. The key findings were that patients who had aromatherapy reported significantly greater improvement in their mood and perceived levels of anxiety. They also felt less anxious and more positive immediately after the therapy, although this effect was not sustained or cumulative.8 When pilot studies on aromatherapy that combined use of essential oils of rose and lavender with touching were done at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the heart variation monitor showed parasympathetic peaks as a subject’s feet were stroked with diluted essential oil. Sometimes just thinking about an aroma or an odor can be as powerful as smelling the actual aroma or odor itself.9Aromas have measurable effects on persons’ feelings. Torii et al10 report on the psychologically stimulating effect of jasmine. Manley11 reports on both the psychologically stimulating effect of lemon, lemon-grass, peppermint, and basil and the relaxing effects of bergamot, chamomile, and sandalwood. Other aromas found to be relaxing are rose and lavender.12 Sweet orange essential oil was effective in both induction of anesthesia and recovery time from anesthesia in children.13These 2 therapies, along with several others, are explored fully in the AACN Protocols for Practice. If you are unfamiliar with these and other complementary therapies, take the opportunity to explore them personally. When you are comfortable with using them yourself, it is easier to introduce them to others.Critical care nursing is more than just meeting the physiological needs of patients. Helping patients and staff members alike to cope with the multiple stressors in the acute care environment is an integral part of nursing. Learning to recognize the manifestations of stress is the first step; the next is adding knowledge and skills about the emerging alternative and complementary therapies in order to cope and prevent the adverse effects of stress.This article is based on the protocol Alternative and Complementary Modalities for Managing Stress and Anxiety in Acute and Critical Care by Lynn Keegan (product #170715: $11, AACN members; $14, nonmembers). It was taken from the Creating a Healing Environment series (set of 5, product #170710; $52, AACN members; $64, nonmembers) of AACN’s Protocols for Practice.

      "abstract": "A diagnosis of epilepsy is made when a person experiences two or more unprovoked seizures, i.e. seizures without an immediate precipitating event such as fever, a blow to the head, active brain infection, or metabolic disturbance. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal electrical discharges which may be confined to a part of the brain or involve the entire cortex. The diagnostic classification system initially developed by the Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy (1989) reflects both the manner in which the seizure begins (partial versus generalized) and the effects of the abnormal discharge (see Table 8.1).",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

If the child endorsed a Major Depressive Episode, the interviewer should inquire whether these symptoms occurred during the same 2-week period. If criteria are met for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. If the child’s symptoms do not meet the full criteria for a Manic or Hypomanic Episode, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, NOS. These children may have typical bipolar symptoms but not the duration required by DSM. In addition, these children may be characterized by severe irritability, aggressiveness, agitation, and/or mood lability. There may also be more rapid cycling of mood.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "title": "Newer oral atypical antipsychotic agents: a review.",
      "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs are commonly prescribed for a variety of psychiatric conditions. In addition to individuals with schizophrenia, the original target patient population, several antipsychotic medications are widely used for bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, delirium, insomnia, agitation, and aggression in various patient types. Despite their important role in the treatment of psychotic and other illnesses, these medications have some shortcomings. Some patients with psychosis fail to respond to treatment, or they may respond incompletely. Some patients experience neurological events such as extrapyramidal side effects or, more rarely, tardive dyskinesia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is another rare but potentially life-threatening complication of treatment with antipsychotic drugs.\r\n\r\nRecently, the antipsychotic medications (particularly the atypical, “second-generation” antipsychotics) have come under scrutiny because of an increased risk of weight gain and metabolic adverse effects (AEs), such as glucose intolerance and lipid abnormalities. These AEs have the potential to increase the risk of type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease as well as morbidity and mortality rates related to these conditions.1 Antipsychotic drugs are often prescribed “off-label” for the management of agitation and psychosis in patients with dementia without an approved FDA indication. The use of these medications in elderly dementia patients has become controversial and has been reported by the FDA to increase the risk of cerebrovascular events as well as the all-cause death rate among these patients, leading to the advent of “black-box” warnings for all antipsychotic drugs.2\r\n\r\nAntipsychotic agents may be classified in several ways. Commonly, they can be designated as older drugs (often called conventional or “typical” antipsychotics) and newer “atypicals.” The term atypical refers to the perceived lower likelihood of extrapyramidal symptoms, a sequela that had been deemed characteristic of the first generation of antipsychotic drugs. The atypicals are widely prescribed based on the perception that they are more effective and produce fewer side effects than the typicals, even though some atypicals are much more expensive.\r\n\r\nCATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness), a large study published in 2005, cast doubt on the relative overall effectiveness of the atypicals, which seemed to perform no better than perphenazine (formerly Trilafon, Schering-Plough), an older, less expensive typical antipsychotic medication.3 Some observers have suggested a return to the use of the less expensive typical medications. In this setting, the field is in need of better agents to bring about improved antipsychotic effects, a lower rate of refractory illness, and reduced both metabolic and neurological side effects.\r\n\r\nThe atypical antipsychotics include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), and aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka). Clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis) is usually included in this list as the prototypical agent, although its potential for bone marrow suppression sets it apart.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of aripiprazole in 2002, there has been a relative hiatus in the development of new atypical antipsychotic drugs. In this article, we review four oral atypical antipsychotic agents introduced since 2007: paliperidone (Invega, Ortho-McNeil-Janssen), iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda), asenapine (Saphris, Organon), and lurasidone (Latuda, Sunovion). We discuss their classification, indications, mechanism of action, clinical trials, efficacy, adverse effects, comparisons with other antipsychotics, new indications being sought, dosing and administration, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, contraindications, FDA warnings, and drug–drug interactions. We excluded antipsychotic agents that are currently under investigation and those that have not yet been approved by the FDA.\r\n\r\nWe conducted a Medline search for the terms paliperidone, iloperidone, asenapine, and lurasidone to identify efficacy and tolerability trials for each drug. Product information and results from unpublished studies were obtained from the manufacturers.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "The weakening of the repression barrier that occurs in sleep and in other altered states of consciousness, such as free association during the process of psychoanalytic therapy, may be produced in a relatively simple fashion during transcendental meditation. An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

      "abstract": "Human development is a process that continues throughout an individuals life. Any change of structure of function, not only of a progressive type, is a developmental change. Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

      "title": "Antiepileptic Drugs in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care",
      "abstract": "The etiology of seizures in the Neurosurgical/Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) can be categorized as emanating from either primary brain pathology, at either macro- or microscopic level, or from physiological derangements of critical care illness such as toxic or metabolic abnormalities. Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

      "title": "What Is a Functional Respiratory Disorder?",
      "abstract": "Functional respiratory disorders can be characterized as occurring in patients with persisting respiratory symptoms lacking an identifiable organic or physiologic basis, or symptoms in excess of what would be expected from just their physiologic cause. Such functional disorders typically have emotional or psychological associations. Common respiratory conditions that are thought to be functional include dyspnea/hyperventilation, habit cough, paroxysmal sneezing, throat clearing, and vocal cord dysfunction. These occur predominantly in children, ­adolescents, and young adults. Additionally, a functional component should be entertained as complicating existing diagnosed physical conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis, which are diseases that affect patients of all ages. Treatment of functional respiratory disorders can include providing reassurance, biofeedback, breathing relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, or speech therapy. Pharmacologic therapy for functional respiratory disorders occasionally may be helpful. Patients with functional respiratory disorders benefit from prompt identification and therapy, as this prevents perpetuation of the associated symptoms, development of further complicating sequelae, unnecessary medical investigations, and prescription of ineffective medical therapy that might have harmful side effects.",

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency.

      "title": "Fatigue in anaesthesiology",
      "abstract": "Fatigue affects everyone. We all remember feeling as though we are jetlagged in the middle of a busy night, desperately trying to stay awake at 4 a.m. If an emergency happens adrenaline kicks in and we wake up; it's the more routine work in which we know sleep deprivation takes its toll. The nature of our work as anaesthesiologists and intensivists can make fatigue particularly problematic. Our patients are often unconscious, so conversation with them does not help keep us alert. We use potentially lethal cocktails of drugs, which we often draw up and administer ourselves, and sometimes machines or monitors malfunction. A few moments' lack of vigilance or misinterpretation of physiological parameters can very quickly have disastrous results. These problems are compounded by the increasing challenge of interpreting and responding to a changing situation when we are tired. For example, the failure to recognise a patient's allergies or the miscalculation of a drug dose can lead to adverse events for patients. Moreover, communication becomes poorer as fatigue sets in, so it can be more challenging to use the team's wisdom to resolve a clinical problem.1 Science confirms what our body tells us. After 12 h awake our empathy starts to wane, logical reasoning is harder, vigilance becomes more variable and cognitive and motor skills become worse to a point where, after 16 to 18 h of wakefulness, our performance is as bad as if we were under the influence of alcohol.2 Our mood deteriorates, we find it much more difficult to think flexibly and respond to quickly-changing situations, and are more likely to take risks. After the ninth consecutive hour of work the risk of being involved in an accident increases and after a 12 h shift we are twice as likely to crash driving home than after an 8 h shift.3 Fatigue: an occupational hazard We accept this as an occupational hazard, but other industries have a different approach. Every other safety critical industry, airline, nuclear, electrical, petrochemical, rail and road haulage are required by law to have formal fatigue risk management strategies. This is not because they have a better understanding of sleep physiology, but because they have had to make changes following several high-impact disasters (Chernobyl, Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Challenger accident).1 The European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA) Workforce, Working conditions, Welfare (WWW) Standing Committee think it is time for European medicine to change its approach. Sleep is safety Potentially, we can capitalise on the general public's interest in our wellbeing, as patient safety is at risk while we are fatigued. It comes as a surprise to an airline pilot that their anaesthesiologist is allowed to administer an anaesthetic after working continuously for 18 h, or to a train driver that a junior doctor is allowed to drive home after a 24 h shift because there are no rest facilities or opportunities to sleep. The cultures are different in these other industries: sleep is safety. We are more likely to earn the respect of the general public, many of whom work in safety critical industries where fatigue risk management systems (FRMSs) are the norm, if we too create a culture where fatigue is seen as a risk to patients and to staff, and systems and resources are put in place to mitigate its effects. Attitudes to work are changing. Many 'generation Y' trainees have a different outlook on work than their 'generation X' and 'baby boomer' consultants. They want a good working atmosphere, a family-friendly approach, and they expect to be well treated, respected and valued as part of the team and get support in their training. They know fatigue impacts on their ability to train and learn. If they are not well managed many generation Y trainees do not stay; they have less loyalty to employers. To them, long hours and working through tiredness are not rites of passage, a sign of being an unbreakable hero or heroine. Generation Z, who will be entering training soon, will interpret such long hours as a sign that the management is out of touch and has not understood basic sleep physiology, or perhaps that management 'do not value their employees sufficiently to provide the resources needed'.4 This may be partly true, circadian physiology was not part of the curriculum 20 years ago. Our understanding of the vital role sleep has for both our safety and for patient recovery has advanced in recent years. We now know that outcomes are worse for patients operated on in the early hours and sleep deprivation in intensive care negatively impacts on recovery, but this is relatively new information.4 One of the core principles in education is to start where the learners are, so we need to ensure that circadian physiology and good fatigue risk management become a core part of the curriculum and senior anaesthesiologists and intensivists are supported in embedding this learning into their clinical work. However, attitudinal learning is not just about embedding facts in our brains, we have to integrate and demonstrate appropriate values in everything we do. Like any learning, this happens in stages. First, we have to hear what is being said and then understand this – the impacts of fatigue on thinking make more sense to us than details about the functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. But only after we value the learning, do we start to put it into place when we are not being observed. Hence, attitudinal learning about fatigue must involve changes in behaviour and changes in attitudes to napping, driving and working when tired, for it to be sustained. Currently, there seems to be a difference in the way learning about sleep physiology is put into practice compared with, for instance, changes in managing ventilation in ICU. One stays only as academic learning, the other is quickly translated into clinical practice. Why is this? ICU ventilators are expensive, much more expensive than sofa beds for staff naps, so it is probably not financially driven. Someone else has to take responsibility while the doctor has a power nap. This might be problematic as we are all understaffed, but it is rare for us to be frantically busy for the whole night. However, organising someone to take the bleep involves creative thinking, planning and negotiating, skills which are much harder as we get more tired, so this may play a role. The ITU ventilator has a direct impact on patient care. In an understaffed environment where the duty to our patients is paramount, the importance of having a power nap in improving the safety of our own clinical practice may be overlooked. We can learn from other industries here, where such behaviour is expected routine practice as part of the FRMS. A change of culture and regulations Expectations of senior staff and management probably have a major influence. Safety literature describes the difference between 'work as imagined' by seniors and managers who once worked in more junior roles, 'work as done' by current junior staff (who do take naps but don't report these), 'work as prescribed' by seniors telling the juniors what is and is not allowed and 'work as disclosed' by juniors reporting to seniors what happened.5 If 'the boss' expects his or her juniors to soldier on and resist their bodies' urge to sleep, trainees are less likely to nap. Often these expectations stem from the senior's own experience when continuing to work while very fatigued was the norm: 'I managed, why shouldn't you cope?'. Moving from a culture where taking a power nap is seen as weak to one where it is regarded as safe practice, as important as checking the drugs or the machine, would help establish safer working practices. When we take a handover from the night staff, the senior should ask 'Have you had a power nap', and if not, make sure the trainee gets home safely, and review the overnight workload, organisational arrangements and support to see if the situation could be improved.5 Some changes have already happened. Efforts have been made in many countries to introduce the European Working Time Regulations to medicine but tighter regulation of working time and better rostering is difficult to achieve with inadequate workforce numbers. In the UK the British Medical Association produced the Fatigue and Facilities Charter and Good Rostering Guide and senior clinicians were appointed to the post of Guardian of Safe Working Hours in every hospital in England.6,7 This has had some positive effects for trainees, but may impact on their clinical experience and, if there are fewer doctors on call, can lead to them having a higher clinical workload. Additionally it does not address the most hazardous fatigue-related activity for doctors; driving home tired after night work.8 Instead of starting with the regulation of working time arrangements, rota design and more staff, we will be more effective if we measure staff tiredness and manage fatigue-related risk. Frequency, duration and intensity of work, individual clinical experience, level of supervision and support from the wider team all influence fatigue-related risk.8 None of this is affected by regulation, but these strategies are known to be effective in the healthcare environment. Many staff do not get the required 8 h sleep per 24 h and are already sleep deprived when they start work. We need to take this into account, ensure they have rest breaks and encourage napping. But most of all we, anaesthesiologists and intensivists, need to acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety risk, identify and implement strategies that work in our own teams and hospitals to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. Individuals, teams and departments and the wider organisation can all play a part in improving fatigue risk management. A change of mindset and attitude at individual level is very productive. Looking after ourselves by practicing 'good sleep hygiene' (simple measures that assure a restful sleep), 'banking' sleep by spending longer than usual in bed before a more challenging session, limiting napping just before work to 30 min to reduce sleep inertia or drinking coffee about 30 min before a challenging anaesthetic case at night, can all be helpful.9 Organisational support is an important factor. Hospital or department directors should make working arrangements reasonable, give help when difficulties arise, be constantly concerned about their employees' physical and mental health, praise the efforts of the team, organise regular teamwork activities – to cultivate the sense of belonging. A good atmosphere of mutual help among doctors is known to improve morale and wellbeing.10 As a profession, anaesthesiologists and intensivists are compassionate individuals who provide support, healing and encouragement to patients. However, fatigued anaesthesiologists find it difficult to demonstrate our core values – caring for others. Fatigue risk management systems FRMSs consist of sets of procedures for the identification and management of fatigue-related safety risks based on continuous risk assessment. These include tracking sleep and work time and using strategies to mitigate the impacts of fatigue on performance.11 Should we follow the lead of other industries that use such a system and develop formal legally binding fatigue risk management regulations in healthcare? At first sight, this might seem attractive, but as Dawson and Thomas8 point out, solutions developed for other industries (e.g. tighter regulation, more staff, better rotas, enforced breaks during shifts and compulsory rest periods before or after on-call) are sometimes ill-suited to healthcare: we can't simply stop work like a lorry driver when he's done too many hours behind the wheel. Sometimes, as Dawson says 'a tired doctor is better than no doctor'.8 Translating improvements from one setting to another will be relevant only if the work setting, workload, job requirements, cultural and organisational arrangements are properly understood. To implement an intervention successfully, it must be realistic and achievable in the specific organisational context, seen as acceptable, helpful, supported and promoted by senior clinicians and managers. An idea cannot simply be imported from industry: in order to work, careful adaptation and intelligent reinvention are needed.12 Dawson suggests that we need a culture change to one where managers and senior clinicians openly acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety hazard, and put strategies in place to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. We need to build an FRMS using multiple, overlapping layers of defence against fatigue-related incidents, such that an error can only occur when all layers of defence fail.13 This is particularly important now with several safety regulatory procedures being temporarily suspended in worldwide healthcare systems because of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, work patterns, ICU physician–patient ratios, certification of specialisation, all due to dramatically increased number of ICU patients and shortage of personnel. Some relatively simple actions have been used in other settings for many years and may be useful to us in healthcare. In the 1980s Dinges and Rosefield showed that a 40-min nap during a long-haul night flight reduced the frequency of lapses in concentration from microsleeps in pilots. This went on to be described as a 'power nap'; other suggested terms such as 'prophylactic nap' or 'planned nap' were rejected by the American Federal Aviation Authority as not tough enough for their culture.14 Examples of such a culture also exist in medicine with free text comments from our trainee surveys noting 'lead ICU consultant tried to remove on call room', being told 'it's shift work so you shouldn't need to rest', or 'actively dissuaded trainees from resting, including by threatening disciplinary action'. We could provide quiet dark safe spaces for staff to have a power nap during breaks. Other strategies that could be introduced into the way we manage night shifts include education around driving risk, tools to assess your own fatigue level (e.g. Karolinska Sleepiness Score and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and fitness to drive home, places to sleep before going home at the end of a shift, and provision of other forms of transport, such as taxis. There should be specific initiatives to protect anaesthesiologists, intensivists and healthcare workers aged more than 55 years involved in overnight work, as the impact of fatigue can worsen with age.15 Could we institute some of these measures and start to build up an FRMS that works in healthcare settings? Measures could be introduced such as making rest facilities and their usage the norm, minimising the chance of healthcare workers becoming impaired at work through thoughtful rota planning, providing enough staffing and providing education for individuals regarding the impact of fatigue on clinical practice, and additional team effort to detect staff who are overly tried and to support them in an appropriate way. Would this start to change our culture, 'the way we do it here'? We do have opportunities. The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the difficulties of excessive workload, understaffing and poor working conditions. Much has been written about impacts on staff wellbeing, there is increased public awareness of the challenges we face and, in many countries, there has been interest in trying to improve matters.13,15 Conclusion Some will embrace the new; innovators and early adopters who welcome improvement. It only takes 20% of people altering behaviour to start and establish new norms. Others will wait until the ideas become mainstream. A few will remain as laggards, for whom the change is too much of a challenge. The EBA WWW Standing Committee initiated the FATIGUE project in 2019, aiming to raise awareness about the consequences of fatigue both on patient safety and on anaesthesiologists' wellbeing and safety. Collaborating closely with the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care and other organisations, the EBA WWW working group aims to promote a change of culture and regulations in our specialty by multiple means: evaluation of current European practice (surveys), educational events, publications. The EBA WWW group is working closely with trainees; it won't be many years before there are enough newly appointed consultants to influence safety education about good fatigue management. Of course, we also have a large group of established consultants who also embrace this approach. Hopefully, there will soon be a change of culture and regulations. After all, why should healthcare not have the same requirement for fatigue risk management as every other safety critical industry?",

However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "title": "Theoretical Accounts of Gulf War Syndrome: From Environmental Toxins to Psychoneuroimmunology and Neurodegeneration",
      "abstract": "Non‐specific illness includes a wide variety of symptoms: behavioural (e.g., reduced food and water intake), cognitive (e.g., memory and concentration problems) and physiological (e.g., fever). This paper reviews evidence suggesting that such symptoms can be explained more parsimoniously as a single symptom cluster than as a set of separate illnesses such as Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This superordinate syndrome could have its biological basis in the activity of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (in particular interleukin‐1: IL‐1), that give rise to what has become known as the ‘sickness response’. It is further argued that the persistence of non‐specific illness in chronic conditions like GWS may be (in part) attributable to a bio‐associative mechanism (Ferguson and Cassaday, 1999). In the case of GWS, physiological challenges could have produced a non‐specific sickness response that became associated with smells (e.g., petrol), coincidentally experienced in the Persian Gulf. On returning to the home environment, these same smells would act as associative triggers for the maintenance of (conditioned) sickness responses. Such associative mechanisms could be mediated through the hypothalamus and limbic system via vagal nerve innervation and would provide an explanation for the persistence of a set of symptoms (e.g., fever) that should normally be short lived and self‐limiting. We also present evidence that the pattern of symptoms produced by the pro‐inflammatory cytokines reflects a shift in immune system functioning towards a (T‐helper‐1) Th1 profile. This position contrasts with other immunological accounts of GWS that suggest that the immune system demonstrates a shift to a Th2 (allergy) profile. Evidence pertaining to these two contrasting positions is reviewed.",

Physical therapy modalities (e.g., iontophoresis, phonophoresis), psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy), relaxation techniques, and complementary therapies (e.g., acupuncture, hypnosis) are all used for the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders; however, no therapies have been shown to be uniformly superior for the treatment of pain or oral dysfunction. Noninvasive therapies should be attempted before pursuing invasive, permanent, or semi-permanent treatments that have the potential to cause irreparable harm. Dental occlusion therapy (e.g., oral splinting) is a common treatment for temporomandibular joint disorders, but a recent systematic review found insufficient evidence for or against its use.

      "abstract": "Unexpected deaths periodically occur in individuals held in police custody. These decedents usually have had significant physical exertion associated with violent and/or bizarre behavior, have been restrained by the police, and often have drug intoxication. Autopsy material from these cases may not provide a satisfactory explanation for the cause of death, and these deaths are then attributed to the excited delirium syndrome. The pathogenesis of excited delirium deaths is likely multifactorial and includes positional asphyxia, hyperthermia, drug toxicity, and/or catecholamine-induced fatal arrhythmias. We suggest that these deaths are secondary to stress cardiomyopathy similar to the cardiomyopathy seen in older women following either mental or physical stress. This syndrome develops secondary to the toxic effects of high levels of catecholamines on either cardiac myocytes or on the coronary microvasculature. Patients with stress cardiomyopathy have unique ventricular morphology on echocardiograms and left ventricular angiography and have had normal coronary angiograms. People who die under unusual circumstances associated with high catecholamine levels have contraction bands in their myocardium. Consequently, the pathogenesis of the excited delirium syndrome could be evaluated by using echocardiograms in patients brought to the emergency centers, and by more careful assessment of the myocardium and coronary vessels at autopsy. Treatment should focus on prevention through the reduction of stress.",

Recreational use of ketamine and the number of illicit seizures of ketamine have increased in recent years, prompting a review of current evidence on its toxicity. Recreational ketamine use is associated with a number of toxic effects, both acute and chronic. Predominant among the acute effects are psychotic symptoms, hallucinations and aggression, which can lead to serious injuries. Chronic ketamine use leads to intractable urological problems and neuropsychiatric problems, Long-term effects also include gastrointestinal problems such as abdominal pain and liver function abnormalities.

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness).

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "title": "REVIEW: Behavioural assessment of drug reinforcement and addictive features in rodents: an overview",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Some psychoactive drugs are abused because of their ability to act as reinforcers. As a consequence behavioural patterns (such as drug‐seeking/drug‐taking behaviours) are promoted that ensure further drug consumption. After prolonged drug self‐administration, some individuals lose control over their behaviour so that these drug‐seeking/taking behaviours become compulsive, pervading almost all life activities and precipitating the loss of social compatibility. Thus, the syndrome of addictive behaviour is qualitatively different from controlled drug consumption. Drug‐induced reinforcement can be assessed directly in laboratory animals by either operant or non‐operant self‐administration methods, by classical conditioning‐based paradigms such as conditioned place preference or sign tracking, by facilitation of intracranial electric self‐stimulation, or, alternatively by drug‐induced memory enhancement. In contrast, addiction cannot be modelled in animals, at least as a whole, within the constraints of the laboratory. However, various procedures have been proposed as possible rodent analogues of addiction’s major elements including compulsive drug seeking, relapse, loss of control/impulsivity, and continued drug consumption despite negative consequences. This review provides an extensive overview and a critical evaluation of the methods currently used for studying drug‐induced reinforcement as well as specific features of addictive behaviour. In addition, comic strips that illustrate behavioural methods used in the drug abuse field are provided given for free download under http://www.zi‐mannheim/psychopharmacology.de",

      "abstract": "A 2-year-old, developmentally normal, boy presented with multiple seizure-like events over 10 days. These episodes were described as brief (20–30 s), vacant stares, associated with impaired awareness, hypersalivation, retching, vomiting, tongue thrusts, and pallor of the face and body. A few episodes exhibited tonic posturing of the upper limbs [Figure 1 and https://links.lww.com/IPCR/A7]. Other aspects of history were normal. There was no dysmorphism or neurocutaneous markers. Neurological examination was normal. Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (epilepsy protocol) was normal. The drug-induced sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominance [Figure 2]. A diagnosis of Self-Limited Epilepsy with Autonomic Seizures (SeLEAS) or \"Panayiotopoulos syndrome\" was made, based on semiology and EEG findings. Seizures stopped within 72 h of starting sodium valproate.Figure 1: The seizure semiology was a vacant stare with impaired awareness associated with hypersalivation, retching, vomiting and tongue thrusting, and pallor of the face and body, lasting for 20–30 s. There was no postictal drowsinessFigure 2: The interictal sleep electroencephalogram record shows frequent sharp wave, spike and slow wave (1–3 Hz, 300–500 microvolt) discharges arising from O1 and O2 with spread to adjacent electrodes, accentuated during photic stimulation. There are independent frequent sharp wave discharges from F3, F4, P3, and FP3 suggestive of multifocal epilepsy with bilateral occipital predominanceSeLEAS is a relatively frequent, benign epileptic syndrome characterized by predominant autonomic symptoms and/or focal onset motor seizures. The former include retching, emesis, changes in color (pallor, flushing, or cyanosis), pupillary dilatation, hypersalivation, cardiorespiratory, and thermoregulatory alterations.[1] Clinicians should be aware of this entity as these events are frequently misdiagnosed as acute encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syndrome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, or gastroenteritis.[2] Interictal EEG shows occipital spikes. Multifocal spikes with high amplitude sharp-slow wave complexes can also occur at various locations. Seizures will stop in most children within 2–3 years of the first episode. The risk of developing epilepsy in adulthood is similar to the general population. Anticonvulsant therapy (oxcarbamazepine, valproate, and levetiracetam) are indicated when seizure frequency is high.

      "abstract": "La posesión demoníaca, descrita por innumerables culturas a lo largo de la historia, sigue siendo actualmente un tema a discutir dentro del debate entre ciencia y religión. Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

      "title": "Palliative sedation: welcome guidance on a controversial issue",
      "abstract": "Palliative sedation (PS) is the use of medications to reduce consciousness for the relief of intolerable and refractory symptoms, in patients with limited life expectancy. The ethical justification of palliative sedation is based upon the principles of double effect, autonomy and proportionality. Double effect is predicated upon the primary intent being to relieve suffering, despite potential foreseeable, but unintended, adverse effects. Proportionality is based upon the use of PS in the face of intolerable distress as a ‘therapy of last resort’, when all other potentially less harmful options have been expended or are inappropriate. PS is neither slow euthanasia nor physician-assisted suicide. Both of these practices involve the specific intent to end life, the deliberate use of lethal doses of sedation drugs, or non-therapeutic escalation of doses disproportionate to symptom distress. PS does not shorten life overall (when implemented in specialist palliative care units), despite the expected risk of individual complications (e.g. respiratory or hemodynamic compromise, aspiration, or venous thromboembolism). Sedative drugs first appeared in modern medicine in the 19th century, with bromide and chloral hydrate. Barbiturates were introduced in 1903, and benzodiazepines in 1959. The first descriptions of sedation for symptom control in advanced disease were published in 1990–1991. The early literature described a wide range in prevalence, indications and clinical practices. The prevalence in these reports ranged from 16% to over 50%. Indications included agitation and restlessness, pain, delirium, respiratory distress, myoclonus, and psychological symptoms. Drugs used for sedation included benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and barbiturates. Despite a number of prospective studies and published guidelines, evidence upon which to base practice has remained limited and controversial issues persist. These include almost every aspect of PS; the definition and terminology (palliative versus terminal), the types of sedation included under this term (intermittent versus continuous, light versus deep), the indications (physical or existential distress), the use of artificial hydration and nutrition, and the ethical basis and differentiation from euthanasia. Decisions about palliative sedation are complex and can have significant implications for the patient and lasting impact on family and staff. Staff need to develop awareness of their own preferences about care of the dying, and the potential role of frustration, sense of failure and burnout in decision making. Individual physician personal and professional factors may influence the practice of PS, including prevalence, determination of refractoriness, level of sedation used, and drugs employed. Families and staff need extensive support to understand the decision-making process, and be clear about the goals and expected outcomes. Identifying a family spokesperson (preferably one chosen by the patient) may help communication, especially for large, geographically scattered or conflicted families. Without effective communication families may be left with feelings of profound confusion, guilt or remorse, which complicate their subsequent bereavement. For these reasons evaluation and decision making by a multidisciplinary team skilled in palliative care is essential prior to initiating PS. Initiating PS without palliative medicine involvement is potentially hazardous. Palliative medicine consultation has been demonstrated to elicit previously undocumented diagnoses (especially delirium), and suggest multiple management strategies in advanced cancer, even within tertiary cancer centers. A dilemma in decision making arises where there is a lack of access to, or awareness of, specialized interventions including palliative medicine, psychiatry, interventional pain management, and spiritual care. Non-palliative medicine physicians need to have insight into their own therapeutic limitations, whilst palliative medicine physicians should be available to provide support via telephone or videoconference to isolated clinicians.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Weight loss positively influences mental health but findings are mixed in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The permanent changes in body image, diet-related stress, and unmet expectations could increase mental health problems such as major depression and self-harm behaviors. Mixed symptoms during major depressive episode were often misdiagnosed as agitated depression, and should be regarded as a risk factor for suicide and rapid cycling course of illness. Method Single case report. Results A 45-year-old woman, initially diagnosed as a unipolar depressive episode after bariatric surgery, did not show improvement after SSRI treatment. She had no history of previous episode but her temperament was described as hyperthymic. Antidepressant worsened irritability, racing/crowded thoughts, heightened anxiety and aggressive impulses, mood instability, impaired concentration, insomnia and she had a suicide attempt (antidepressant overdose). After mood stabilizer and atypical antipsychotic, symptoms fully remitted and she is stable in the last year. Conclusion Self-harm emergencies after bariatric surgery are higher than before surgery. Intentional overdose is considered the most common self-harm mechanism. Psychiatric follow-up after bariatric surgery and early recognition of bipolar depression with mixed features as a distinct condition among the variety of depressive syndromes is essential to reduce the risk of self-harm behaviors and improve treatment outcomes. Premorbid temperamental features, especially hyperthymic and cyclothymic temperaments, are often responsible for such mixed depressive presentations.

Existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are recognised to have effects on the central nervous system beyond seizure control. Awareness is growing, in particular, about effects on cognition and behavior. To achieve acceptance as a drug for chronic therapy, it is desirable for a new compound to have a sufficiently long elimination half-life (t12,el) such that once- or twice-daily dosing is all that is required; a half-life in the range of 15–30h is ideal.

      "abstract": "Disulfiram, a useful medication to deter the relapse of alcohol dependence, has been associated with a number of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Disulfiram induced delirium is rare in the absence of an ongoing psychosis or a disulfiram- ethanol reaction. We present the case of an alcohol dependent patient who had a past history of both an alcohol-induced psychotic episode (which had resolved completely) and alcohol withdrawal seizure. Following inpatient detoxification and induction on disulfiram, to which he was compliant and maintaining totally abstinent, he developed an acute delirious state 6 weeks after disulfiram. It was characterized by fluctuating disorientation, marked inattention, affective lability, increased psychomotor activity, irrelevant speech, social disinhibition, at times staring, talking to self and gesturing in air, and sleep-wake cycle reversal with evening worsening of symptoms. He was re-hospitalized and symptoms subsided by 72 hours after stopping disulfiram. The diagnostic dilemma associated with such a presentation is discussed, along with the putative mechanisms and clinical pointers.",

It is a matter of common experience for one doing extensive intranasal surgery to be confronted by a so-called cocaine reaction, and this is especially true when using flake anesthesia. Often people are encountered who exhibit an idiosyncrasy to the drug, and who, consequently, are susceptible even to minute amounts. The intoxication is manifested usually by loquacity, restlessness, tremor and cardiac palpitation. There is also present a peculiar writhing of the tongue and the face. This hyperactivity of the lingual and facial musculature may become so troublesome as to interfere seriously with the necessary intranasal manipulations. Not rarely, the symptoms of mild intoxication noted in the foregoing may progress to those associated with profound depression, combined with cold clammy sweat, pallor and even syncope which",

In order to make a diagnosis of catatonia, the clinical picture must be dominated by three or more of the following symptoms; cataplexy, waxy flexibility, stupor, agitation, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerisms, stereotypies, grimacing, echolalia, and echopraxia. We present a case of a 58-year-old female with no prior psychiatric history who presented to the psychiatric emergency room with a three-week history of feeling depressed, anhedonic, hopeless, helpless, and worthless, associated with poor sleep, poor concentration, low energy, significant weight loss due to lack of appetite, and suicidal ideations after she saw her ex-boyfriend holding hands with another woman. Patient exhibited symptoms such as mutism, hyperextension of spine, clinching of jaw, psychomotor retardation which suggested probable diagnosis of catatonia at the background of major depressive disorder nonresponding to treatment. This case report demonstrates the need for a high index of suspicion and early screening for catatonia in psychiatric patients given the high morbidity and mortality that is associated with this condition if delayed or undiagnosed",

To cope with these insomnia problems in the hospital setting, patients often request drug treatment, which leads to over-prescription of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines. This leads to serious side effects such as an increased risk of falling, confusion and respiratory depression. This hostile hospital environment must be taken into account before considering specific treatment.Plusieurs facteurs environnementaux jouent un rôle dans la mauvaise qualité du sommeil des patients hospitalisés, tels que les nuisances sonores, les réveils nocturnes pour l’administration de médicaments ou la prise de signes vitaux, l’inconfort des lits, la luminosité ou encore certains équipements nocturnes. Pour faire face à ces problèmes d’insomnie en milieu hospitalier, les patients sont souvent demandeurs d’un traitement médicamenteux, ce qui mène à une surprescription de sédatifs, tels que les benzodiazépines.

The objective is to update the knowledge available on the ability of the marijuana and the stimulants to produce long term psychiatric disorders, or to unmask vulnerabilities to them. We have done an electronic bibliographical research in MEDLINE using the following key words: psychiatric disorders, amphetamine, stimulants, marijuana, cannabis, long term effects, psychosis, cognitive and cognitive deficits. The marijuana might induce permanent psychosis in subjects with vulnerability to schizophrenia or to psychosis. The cognitive effects are acute and subacute, related with the presence of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the central nervous system. The stimulants can produce a schizophrenia-like psychosis, and they can produce long term cognitive deficits. The stimulants also might produce subsyndromic mood disorders.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

It is due to a jelling process that occurs during rest and that must be reversed before normal function can be resumed comfortably. I interpret the manifestation, which may be named postinertial dyskinesia, to be indicative of a ligamentous reaction rather than a bone abnormality. If one were to watch a group of persons arise after a card game or watch passengers get out of a bus or auto after a long, uninterrupted ride, he would observe that a certain number of them move about in a stiff, awkward, and frequently painful manner. This postinertial dyskinesia is very common in persons over 60 years of age after physical activity such as golf. The condition persists for a variable",

      "abstract": "Background : Sedative drugs are important in many ways in medicolegal practice. They are used to subdue or alter the mind of a victim and also such drugs themselves can cause death. These drugs are used in robberies as well as in murder cases. Case Report: Two averagely built healthy parents were found dead on bed with deep cut injuries to neck, with minimal evidence of volitional activities and defense injuries. An involvement of a poison was suspected. The elder daughter had felt a bitter taste of the dinner and kept it in the refrigerator at that night. The dinner was sent for toxicological investigations. Causes of deaths were cut injuries to neck. At the same time, the investigators found out that the younger daughter had mixed diazepam to dinner and her boyfriend and 4 others killed the parents. A film they had watched had influenced them to initiate this incident. Conclusion: Two well-built conscious adult victims in sober state should have received at least few defense injuries or leave evidence of volitional activities. In such circumstances, intoxication with drugs or incapacitated with other means should be considered by the forensic pathologist.",

      "title": "Insomnia: zolpidem extended-release for the treatment of sleep induction and sleep maintenance symptoms.",
      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

      "title": "Determining Brain Death: Basic Approach and Controversial Issues",
      "abstract": "Between 15% and 30% of patients admitted to intensive care units are comatose at some point during their admission as a result of primary neurologic (trauma, stroke, meningitis, neoplasm, seizures) or systemic (cardiopulmonary arrest, toxins, sepsis, metabolic derangements) problems.1 Comatose patients have grossly impaired brain function that renders them unconscious. Although some comatose patients recover, others reacquire minimal environmental awareness (a minimally conscious state), transition to being in a vegetative state, or progress to death.2 Patients who become vegetative have a complete lack of awareness of themselves and their environment, but have sleep-wake cycles and variable preservation of cranial nerve function. After a month of being vegetative, a patient is described as being in a persistent vegetative state, and if there is a high degree of clinical certainty that the condition is irreversible, the patient is deemed to be in a permanent vegetative state.3 Patients who are comatose, have absent brainstem reflexes, and are unable to breathe spontaneously are brain dead and are legally dead throughout the United States.4–6Similar to the general public, nursing students do not have a good understanding of the difference between coma, a vegetative state, and brain death.7–9 Although nurses in intensive care units are exposed to brain death, they, too, often do not understand the concept of brain death and the process of brain death determination.10 Because management of patients with catastrophic brain injuries who are being evaluated for brain death in the intensive care unit can be both medically and ethically challenging, it is imperative for critical care nurses to have a firm understanding of brain death and the controversies that can arise during and after determination of brain death.The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) created guidelines for determination of brain death in adults in 1995 and updated them in 2010.6,11 The AAN requires that a single examination be performed to determine that a patient is comatose, has no brainstem reflexes, and is unable to breathe spontaneously.Before conducting a brain death evaluation, it is necessary to confirm that (1) there is an irreversible and proximate cause of coma according to the medical history and the results of physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing; (2) drug levels or calculations of drug clearance based on 5 times a drug’s half-life indicate that no sedatives or narcotics are present in the patient’s system (of note, hypothermia or abnormal hepatic or renal function may extend a drug’s half-life); (3) the blood alcohol level is less than 0.08 g/dL; (3) no neuromuscular blocking agents have been administered recently or reversal of paralytic agents has been confirmed by using a train-of-4 test; (4) no severe electrolyte, acid-base, or endocrine derangements are present; (5) the patient’s body temperature is greater than 36°C (this may require the use of a warming blanket); and (6) the patient’s systolic blood pressure is at least 100 mm Hg (this may require the use of vasopressors).Patients who are brain dead have no evidence of responsiveness to painful stimulation of their extremities, supraorbital ridges, or temporomandibular joints but may have spinal reflexes, which can be disconcerting at times (eg, the Lazarus sign, in which a patient appears to grasp for the endotracheal tube spontaneously during apnea testing or with neck flexion).12 Additionally, all brainstem reflexes are absent in brain-dead patients as follows:If a patient meets the prerequisites for a brain death evaluation and is found to be comatose with no brainstem reflexes, apnea testing must be performed to finalize the brain death determination. Before apnea testing, it is necessary to ensure that the patient is normotensive (systolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg), normothermic (body temperature &gt; 36°C), eucapnic (Paco2 35–45 mm Hg), and adequately preoxygenated (Pao2 &gt; 200 mm Hg; oxygenation on a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0 for at least 10 minutes). The AAN guidelines require that, after meeting prerequisites, patients be disconnected from the ventilator for 8 to 10 minutes. During this time, oxygenation is preserved through delivery of 100% oxygen at 6 L/min through an insufflation catheter placed in the endotracheal tube at the level of the carina. If the patient breathes during testing, the procedure is aborted, as the patient is clearly not brain dead. If the patient is unstable during apnea testing (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg, oxygen saturation &lt; 85%, or an arrhythmia develops), the patient should be reconnected to the ventilator and the procedure may be retried when the patient is stable using a T-piece, 10 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure, and 100% oxygen at 12 L/min. If no evidence of respiratory drive is observed during testing, the patient should be reconnected to the ventilator and a blood sample should be sent for blood gas analysis. If respiratory movements are absent during testing and Paco2 is at least 60 mm Hg or is 20 mm Hg greater than the patient’s prior Paco2 on the repeat blood gas analysis, the apnea test is considered positive (consistent with brain death). If the Paco2 does not increase adequately, the test is inconclusive and may be repeated for 10 to 15 minutes if the patient is hemodynamically stable.If results of the full neurologic examination and apnea testing are consistent with brain death, the patient is declared dead. However, if part of the neurologic examination cannot be completed (eg, in the setting of facial trauma) or if a patient cannot tolerate apnea testing, an ancillary test should be performed to confirm the brain death determination (of note, brain death is a clinical determination and ancillary testing is not a substitute for the clinical evaluation; apnea testing and all portions of the clinical examination that can be conducted must be done and must be consistent with brain death before ancillary testing is performed to confirm the clinical findings). The ancillary tests that the AAN recommends include an electroencephalogram to demonstrate cerebral inactivity or an angiogram or nuclear study to demonstrate lack of intracranial blood flow. Because brain death is a clinical determination, it is important to be aware that no ancillary test is perfect and it is possible to have false-positive or false-negative results.13Guidelines for brain death determination in pediatric patients were written by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1987 and then updated in conjunction with the Pediatric Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Child Neurology Society in 2011.5,14 These guidelines are grossly similar to the AAN guidelines for brain death determination in adults except for the following: (1) after an observation period of 24 to 48 hours, 2 examinations and 2 apnea tests should be performed by 2 different physicians (in adults, only 1 examination and apnea test is required and there is no mandatory observation period); (2) systolic blood pressure should be normalized for age (in adults, systolic blood pressure must be ≥ 100 mm Hg); (3) core body temperature should be &gt; 35°C (in adults, body temperature must be &gt; 36°C); (4) sedative and narcotic elimination should be considered, but there is no finite recommendation for the number of half-lives that must pass before a brain death examination can be performed (in adults, at least 5 half-lives must pass after sedative or narcotic administration before a brain death examination can be performed); (5) for an apnea test to be positive, the Paco2 must be at least 60 mm Hg and must be 20 mm Hg greater than baseline (in adults, the Paco2 must be at least 60 mm Hg or must be 20 mm Hg greater than baseline); and (6) ancillary testing may be done if there is uncertainty about the results of the examination or if medication effect interferes with evaluation of the patient (in adults, ancillary testing is done only if apnea testing or a portion of the clinical examination cannot be completed).5,6Because brain dead patients are legally dead, organ support should be discontinued in a reasonably respectful time period after brain death determination. However, it is important to be aware that brain dead patients are candidates for organ donation. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) should be contacted before the brain death determination in comatose patients if brain death is being discussed or withdrawal of life-sustaining interventions is anticipated. Discussions of organ donation should be initiated with families only by trained OPO personnel, not by members of the treatment team, once the OPO has determined that a patient is a donation candidate. If a family consents to organ donation, hemodynamic support is maintained until organ retrieval can be arranged. Because systemic complications, including neurogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and diabetes insipidus, may develop in brain dead patients, it is often necessary to support patients awaiting organ retrieval with dopamine, methylprednisolone, levothyroxine, and vasopressin.15Some controversial aspects of brain death determination include (1) variability in the performance of brain death determinations, (2) management of religious objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria, (3) determination of brain death after therapeutic hypothermia, and (4) determination of brain death for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Despite clear guidelines on determination of brain death,5,6 institutional protocols for brain death determination vary both within the United States and around the world.16,17 A 2016 review of 508 US hospitals’ protocols for adult brain death revealed variability in prerequisites for a brain death examination, examination requirements, apnea testing requirements, examiner credentials, number of examinations, waiting periods between examinations, indications for ancillary testing, and ancillary tests to perform.16 In a 2015 survey on brain death determination worldwide, only 77% of countries endorsed having institutional brain death protocols, and responses showed variability in examination requirements, apnea testing, and ancillary testing.17Although brain death is widely accepted in the United States and around the world as death on medical, legal, and ethical levels,4,18–21 families sometimes voice religious objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria.22 As a result, 4 states (California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York) have legal accommodations for families who voice objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria on religious grounds.23 However, other states do not offer legal guidance about management of this situation, and most hospitals do not have protocols that address this scenario. This situation leaves treatment teams bewildered and results in variable management strategies such as continuation of organ support until cardiopulmonary arrest, transfer to other facilities, and discontinuation of organ support without family consent. When these situations arise, management is often affected by fear of lawsuits or media attention.18,24,25Unfortunately, comatose patients with anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest sometimes deteriorate neurologically despite use of therapeutic hypothermia to optimize neurologic recovery. Determination of brain death can be challenging in this scenario. Webb and Samuels26 described a 55-year-old man who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia and had findings consistent with brain death when examined 24 hours after rewarming. Organ procurement was planned, but when he was taken to the operating room, it was noted that he had regained some brainstem reflexes and thus was not brain dead. It is important to be aware that treatment with therapeutic hypothermia can confound the process of brain death determination, so it is necessary to wait an extended period of time after rewarming to perform a brain death determination in such patients.26When patients require ECMO, the chance of brain death is 10% to 20%.27,28 Performance of apnea testing in this population is complex, controversial, and challenging.29,30Determination of brain death can be both medically and ethically challenging. Critical care nurses must be aware of the intricacies of the determination process to provide adequate care to these patients and support their families. Additionally, critical care nurses should strive to ensure that institutional protocols for brain death adhere to societal guidelines in order to minimize complications and controversies.5,6",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity.

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

Refractory delirium, dyspnoea or pain are the most common indications. If deep palliative sedation is used, the estimated life expectancy should be a few days to at most one week. Midazolam is used most often for continuous sedation, usually by subcutaneous infusion; if the response is insufficient, a combination of midazolam with levomepromazine or phenobarbital or monotreatment with propofol may be used. If continuous infusion is not desired or feasible, intermittent administration of midazolam, diazepam, lorazepam or chlorpromazine may be considered.

      "abstract": "A subject is conscious when he is awake and with an adequate awareness of him and the environment. The term alteration of consciousness requires specification as to whether it defines alteration of arousal - when the patient might be confused, in a stupor or in some degree of coma (light, deep) - or alteration of awareness – that is, confused (spatiotemporally disorientated, with difficulty in maintaining his attention), with or without delirious ideation. The coma, in the strict sense, originates from structural (neurological) or functional (metabolic) dysfunction of the ascending reticular activator system, but it is accepted that it can derive also from diffuse bihemispheric cortical-subcortical damage. In the emergency department the starting point is the triad of situations that requires immediate treatment applying the normal protocol (ABC); next, pathologies involving risk to life, which might cause cerebral hypoxia, are ruled out: diminished cardiac output, shock and respiratory failure. Subsequently, a neurological evaluation is made, bearing in mind two situations of potential gravity: endocraneal hypertension and diseases that might cause respiratory failure due to muscular fatigue. Neurological exploration will specify the respiratory, pupil and ocular patterns and motor responses. The depth of the coma is established through scales; a simplification of Jouvet’s scale is proposed. The etiological diagnosis will on occasion require image tests and lumbar puncture.",

Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

The distribution of different causes may reflect the geographic location of the hospital. The most common substances used for self-inflicted death by poisoning are tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates (particularly children), and street drugs. In the elderly, suicide attempts and unintentional intoxication through misjudgment of dose remain the leading causes. Overdose and acute brain injury may go together. Patients with traumatic brain injury may have been intoxicated or overdosed and some strokes are seen after use of illicit drugs. It is important to assess the severity of the intoxication, but also the management of the patient particularly when there are recurrent seizures or permanent unexplained unconsciousness.

These conditions are illnesses or impairments that are expected to last for an extended period of time and require medical attention and care that is above and beyond what would normally be expected for a child or adolescent of the same age, extensive hospitalization, or in-home health services.1 These conditions include, among others, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, spina bifida, hemophilia, seizure disorders, neuromuscular disease, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and congenital heart diseases. Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. Most of these conditions are relatively mild and interfere little with the children's ability to participate in usual childhood activities.4 However.",

This is a known problem among individuals with psychiatric illness, which may be partly due to the adverse metabolic effects of certain psychotropic drugs. Melatonin, liraglutide, and naltrexone/bupropion are examples of drugs with different mechanisms of action that have favorable effects on obesity or medication-related weight gain. Melatonin is appropriate to consider for any patient who will be started on a psychotropic drug that is potentially associated with weight gain or other adverse metabolic effects. Liraglutide should also be considered appropriate for use in overweight or obese psychiatric patients, including those with medication-associated weight gain. The use of naltrexone/bupropion may be problematic in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia because of the potential adverse effects of the bupropion component of the combination. All three drugs deserve further dedicated studies in psychiatric patient populations. [ Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services, 53 (6), 19–22.]",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

Antineoplastic agents and antiretroviral medications are most often involved: platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, taxols and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These agents cause a dose-related axonal polyneuropathy. Symptoms are indicative of a predominantly sensory or sensory-motor neuropathy which in some cases is accompanied by dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. Depending on dosage and agent used symptoms resolve completely or not. Neurotoxic effect can appear immediately during or shortly after administration of the drug but sometimes after cessation of chemotherapy. In all cases the neuropathy alters the quality of life. A general predisposition for developing a neuropathy has been observed in nerves previously damaged by diabetes mellitus, alcohol or in inherited neuropathy. Within the past five years, some cases of neuropathy caused by alpha-interferon, statins or tacrolimus have been reported. Although rare, these aetiologies should be considered by physicians and the drugs removed when others causes of neuropathy have been excluded. Few cases of peripheral neuropathy have been recently reported with metronidazole, dapsone, nitrofurantoin or colchicin. Thalidomide induces a dose-dependant sensori-motor length-dependent axonal neuropathy. It should be judiciously used with close neurologic monitorin. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the development of neuropathy. Up to now, no drug is available to prevent or cure drug-induced neuropathies.",

      "abstract": "Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not reach symptom remission. These patients with residual symptoms have worse function and worse prognosis than those who remit. Several augmentation and combination treatments are used to either increase the chances of achieving remission or to eliminate/minimize residual depressive symptoms. Evidence for these pharmacological approaches rests primarily on open, uncontrolled studies, and there are clearly not enough controlled studies. Clinicians should carefully weigh these different treatment options to increase their patients’ chances of achieving and sustaining remission from depression. This paper will review the pertinent studies and will propose a novel approach to improve practice involving the use of augmentation or combination strategies at the outset of initial treatment to primarily enhance the chances of remission through synergy and/or a broader spectrum of action. This novel approach could potentially enhance retention and/or increase remission rates since the lack of response with antidepressant monotherapy may lead many depressed patients with little or no benefit to drop out of treatment, precluding the subsequent use of augmentation or combination strategies altogether. In addition, the emergence of certain side-effects (e.g., agitation, insomnia) or the persistence of some initial baseline symptoms (e.g., anxiety, insomnia) may lead to premature discontinuation from monotherapy in the absence of concomitant use of augmenting pharmacological options targeting these symptoms.",

They are usually rare, 1 or 2 yearly. The risk is increased for heavy drinkers but returns to normal for ex-drinkers. Seizures related to alcoholism are usually generalized tonico clonic seizures with normal EEG and CT-scan. When partial seizures are identified they are attributed to preceding brain damage, head trauma or stroke.",

      "abstract": "Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.",

The most commonly observed forms are inherited congenital sensorineural, acquired later-onset sensorineural (ototoxicity, presbycusis) and acquired later-onset conductive (chronic otitis externa/media). In most dog and cat breeds inherited congenital sensorineural deafness results from perinatal degeneration of the stria vascularis, the vascular bed of the outer wall of the cochlear duct, which leads to hair cell degeneration. The strial degeneration appears to result from the absence of melanocytes, but their function in this structure is unknown. Ototoxicity may result from any of a large number of drugs and chemicals that directly or indirectly destroy cochlear hair cells. The effects are dose-dependent and in rare cases reversible. The most commonly recognized ototoxic drugs are the aminoglycoside antibiotics. Presbycusis, the ageing-related progressive hearing loss unattributable to other causes, is sensorineural but may also include mechanical changes in the tympanum and ossicles. Hearing aids may be accepted by some dogs as long as some residual function remains. Breeds reported to have been affected by congenital sensorineural deafness are listed and those with the highest prevalence are noted. Methods for diagnosis of deafness are described.",

nocturnal awakenings, and/ or early morning awakenings.It is recommended that HALCION not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Patients with known hypersensitivity to this drug or other benzodiazepines.HALCION is contraindicated in pregnant women due to&otential fetal damage.Patients likely to become pregnant while receiving HALCI N should be warned of the potential risk to the fetus.WARNINGS: Overdosage may occur at four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose.Patients should be cautioned not to exceed prescribed dosage.Because of its depressant CNS effects, patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and also about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs.Anterograde amnesia and paradoxical reactions have been reported with HALCION and some other benzodiazepines.PRECAUTIONS: General: In elderly and/ or debilitated patients, treatment should be initiated at 0.125 mg to decrease the possibility of development of oversedation, dizziness, or impaired coordination.Caution should be exercised in patients with signs or symptoms of depression which could be intensified by hypnotic drugs.Suicidal tendencies and intentional overdosage is more common in these patients.The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and chronic pulmonary insufficiency.Information for Patients: Alert patients about: (a) consumption of alcohol and drugs, (b) possible fetal abnormalities, (c) operating machinery or driving, (d) not increasing prescribed dosage, (e) possible worsening of sleep after discontinuing HALCION.Laboratory Tests: Not ordmarily required in otherwise healthy patients.Drug Interactions: Additive CNS depressant effects with other psychotropics, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other CNS depressants.Pharmacokinetic interactions of benzodiazepines with other drugs have been reported.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice during a 24-month study with HALCION in doses up to 4000 times the human dose.Pregnancy: Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage if administered during pregnancy.The child born of a mother who is on benzodiazepines may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms and neonatal flaccidity during the postnatal period.Nursing Mothers: Administration to nursing mothers is not recommended.Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in children below the age of 18 have not been established.ADVERSE REACTIONS: During placebo-controlled clinical studies in which 1003 patients received HALCION Tablets, the most troublesome side effects were extensions of the pharmacologic activity of HALCION, e.g.drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.HALCION Placebo Number of Patients 1003 997 % of Patients Reporting: Central Nervous System Drowsiness 14.0 6.4 Headache 9. 7 8.4 Dizziness 7.8 3.1 Nervousness 5.2 4.5 Lightheadedness 4.9 0.9 Coordination Disorder/ Ataxia 4.6 0.8 Gastrointestinal NauseaMmiting 4.6 3.7In addition, the following adverse events have been reported less frequently (i.e., 0.9-0.5%):euphoria, tachycardia, tiredness, confusional states/ memory impairment, cramps/ pain, depression, visual disturbances.Rare (i.e., less than 0.5%) adverse reactions included constipation, taste alterations, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, dreaming/ nightmares, insomnia, paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, congestion, death from hepatic failure in a patient also receiving diuretic drugs.The following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia, irritability, anorexia, fatigue, sedation, slurred speech, jaundice, pruritus, dysarthria, changes in libido, menstrual irregularities, incontinence and urinary retention.As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects may occur rarely and in a random fashion.Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.No laboratory changes were considered to be of physiological significance.When treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts, urinalysis and blood chemistry analyses are advisable.Minor changes in EEG&anerns, usually low-voltage fast activity have been observed in patients during HALCI N therapy and are of no known significance.DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Controlled Substance: HALCION Tablets are a Controlled Substance in Schedule IV.Abuse and Dependence: Withdrawal symptoms have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines.Patients with a history of seizures are at particular risk.Addiction-prone patients should be closely monitored.Repeat prescriptions should be limited to those under medical supervision.OVERDOSAGE: Because of the potency of triazolam, overdosage may occur at 2 mg, four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (0.5 mg).Manifestations of overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, slurred speech, and ultimately, coma.Respiration, pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored and supported by general measures when necessary.Immediate gastric lavage should be performed.Multiple agents may have been in~ested.Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30 C (59°•86°F).Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

      "abstract": "Abstract As we have already discussed, in much of the assessment of psychopathology the focus is on internal, unobservable processes of which there is only indirect evidence. In chapter 2, we described the signs and symptoms that comprise the main types of psychopathology. We mentioned that in addition to complaints of subjective distress (symptoms), evidence for the presence of psychopathology may also be shown in the form of abnormal behaviour, which may be self-reported by the subject or observed by a clinician/researcher or other informant (observational measures or signs). One such example of this type of evidence can be noted in the examination of children with suspected attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence regarding a subject’s ADHD could consist of both the individual’s own description of their perceptions, cognitions and emotions and of observations by a clinician or, for that matter, by a parent or a teacher. Probably, the simplest way of measuring psychopathology is by the means of questionnaires. The subject or an informant/observer (such as a spouse, a close friend, parent or teacher) answers a series of questions about the subject’s behaviour and experiences, either in a written pencil and paper or computerized form. Some examples of the use of questionnaires are given in more detail elsewhere, particularly in chapters 7,8 and 9.",

Data from eight patients, ranging from 2.8-15 years old (median 8.7 years), treated with the diagnosis of NCSE were evaluated on clinical basis. The patients attended the hospital with acute confusional state ranging from sudden onset of verbal cooperation insufficiency to aimless-meaningless behavior and confusion without any motor component of seizure. While five of the cases were diagnosed and followed up with epilepsy, the other three had no history of epilepsy. No reason was detected that could cause acute encephalopathy. EEG examinations during acute confusional state showed partial or generalized continuous electrographic seizure activity lasting at least 30 minutes without clinical seizure activity. After administration of intravenous antiepileptic medication, the confusional states of the patients recovered, and the EEG examinations showed normal baseline activity with significantly diminished discharges or complete normal waveform. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be considered in all children admitted to the hospital with acute unexplained encephalopathy, whether they have a history of epilepsy or not.

Causation of the mental symptoms in certain cases is outlined, schematically, as a complex system of vicious circles, in which the two factors of anxiety and metabolic imbalance both play a part. 4. In view of our personal good results in such cases, a high-vitamin diet is recommended for tentative trial not only in acute or subacute psychoses characterized by delirium and amentia, but also in acute episodes of the organic-reaction type which occur in the course of schizophrenic and manic-depressive psychosis.",

Depending on the intensity of symptoms patients are handicapped up to suicidal risk. Prophylactical treatment with neuroleptics, which is of great help in many cases, needs careful handling of individual dosage. In case depressive symptoms appear, first and best therapy is to reduce or even discontinue the application of the neuroleptic, later antiparkinsonian drugs should be added (or increased). Only when this regimen is unsuccessful or too slow, thymoleptics should be given carefully and temporarily. -- A schematized long-term neuroleptic treatment often causes needless inconvenience to the patients. Psychiatrists should use the spectrum of psychopharmacological drugs carefully, not only to bring a vita minima without relapse to the formerly schizophrenic patient but to help him live a life worth living after psychosis.",

This hallucinogenic effect is caused by Psilocybin, ahallucinogenic substance often found within Psilocybe mushroom. This substanceaffects mental state of the consumer and has similar effect to those of LSD andMescaline. Aside from its effect to cause mental disturbance, consumption of thismushroom may cause acute renal injury which leads to a fatal and life-threateningsituation.Case presentation: A case of Psilocybe intoxication had been reported in a22 years old male with a confirmed history of consuming Psilocybe mushroom. Patientfirst came with a symptom of disorientation and restlessness. Patient also often shookhis head off, laughed out, screamed, and continuously making bizarre movements.Psychiatric examination confirmed a sign of auditory hallucination, unstable mood,and stereotypical behavior experienced by the patient. Conclusion: An approach isneeded in the form of a physical examination and support that supports a promptand precise diagnosis, as well as comprehensive management that focuses on thedirect management of life-threatening symptoms and symptomatic treatment, takinginto account the signs and symptoms of life-threatening nephrotoxicity",

A panic attack is defined as an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes that occurs in conjunction with several other associated symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Features of panic disorder that are more common in adolescents than in adults include less worry about additional panic attacks and decreased willingness to openly discuss their symptoms. All patients with suspected panic disorder should undergo a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory workup to exclude medical causes of panic attacks. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including interoceptive exposures is the gold standard therapy intervention. Medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can also help reduce symptoms.",

      "abstract": "4,4’-Diaminodiphenylsulphone (Dapsone) is widely used for a variety of infectious, immune and hypersensitivity disorders, with indications ranging from Hansen's disease, inflammatory disease and insect bites. However, the use of dapsone may be associated with a plethora of adverse effects, some of which may involve the pulmonary parenchyma, methemoglobinemia with resultant cyanosis, bone marrow aplasia and/or hemolytic anemia, peripheral neuropathy and the potentially fatal dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS). DHS typically presents with a triad of fever, skin eruption and an internal organ (lung, liver, brain and other systems) involvement, occurring several weeks to as late as 6 months after the initial administration of the drug. In this sense, it may resemble a DRESS syndrome (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms). DHS must be promptly identified as untreated and the disorder could be fatal. Moreover, the pulmonary/systemic manifestations may be mistaken for other disorders. Eosinophilic infiltrates, pneumonitis, pleural effusions and interstitial lung disease may be seen. This syndrome is best approached with the immediate discontinuation of the offending drug and prompt administration of oral or intravenous glucocorticoids. An immunological-inflammatory basis of the syndrome can be envisaged based on the pathological picture and excellent response to anti-inflammatory therapy. Since dapsone is used for various indications, physicians from all specialties may encounter DHS and need to familiarize themselves with the salient features of the syndrome and its management.",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

      "abstract": "A consultation on the neuropsychiatric aspects of HIV-1 infection was held at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters January 11-13, 1990. Of topics discussed, participants concluded that a group of conditions characterized by cognitive and motor impairment can be described. New terminology was suggested accordingly. Participants found that otherwise health HIV-1 seropositive patients were no more likely than HIV-1 seronegative patients to manifest clinically significant cognitive impairment. The serological screening of asymptomatic patients for HIV-1 in attempts to protect public safety was therefore deemed unnecessary. Hallucinations and delusions being not infrequent in AIDS and ARC patients, they may be indicative of cognitive impairment or later accompanied by symptoms pointing to diagnosis of delirium or dementia. Acute psychotic disorders outside of evidence of cognitive impairment may result as anomalies described within the text. Depressive syndrome may result outside of severe depressive episode or major depression due to recent diagnosis as HIV-1 positive and/or as the first stage of HIV-1 dementia. DIstinguishing between ARC and the above-mentioned states as the cause of this syndrome may be difficult. Consultation participants cited stress associated with HIV-1 infection or disease to be conditioned by several factors. Finally, neuropsychiatric disorders due to HIV-1 opportunistic processes were discussed. Country-level recommendations included preparing health workers for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions in the HIV-1 positive patient, and notifying then that otherwise healthy HIV-1 positive patients may not show clinically significant signs of cognitive impairment. Recommendations followed in urging health services to prepare for a large burden of neuropsychiatric illness in AIDS and ARC patients; governments should support services and train health workers accordingly. Pre- and post-serological testing counseling was stressed, with facility for and understanding of the special needs of HIV-1 positive patients' families and involved health staff. Research on the neurological and mental health needs of patients should be given high priority with attention given to the immediate policy and care implications. Final qualification of the difficulty involved in generalizing research findings to apply across sociocultural and geographical contexts was provided with mention in the text of a WHO multicenter study addressing this concern in its pilot phase at the time of publication. Neurological tests were designed for use in this study to be culturally nonspecific.",

Tricyclics are the drugs of first choice, with monoamine oxidase inhibitors playing a secondary role except in special instances. Drugs can be used along with electroconvulsive therapy when treatment is urgent. Differences in the pharmacologic effects of tricyclics may affect their choice for individual patients. Monitoring of plasma concentrations of tricyclics may uncover some sources of drug failure, such as altered drug kinetics in an individual patient or noncompliance with treatment. Side-effects of antidepressant drugs are numerous; most represent extensions of known pharmacologic actions. Overdoses produce severe intoxications that require expert and assiduous management.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

Disorientation to time and place, and disturbance of the sleep–wake cycle are also common features (American Psychiatric Association 1994). The clinical picture in a developing delirium is often characterised by new onset: • social withdrawal • restlessness • anxiety (or an increase in anxiety) • irritability • insomnia • nightmares (Jacobson & Leuchter 1996) There is a lack of consensus about the factors that are likely to precipitate a delirium. The most significant risk factors for Levkoff et al (1992) are ageing, dementia, sensory impairment, ill-health and being in institutional care. However, the use of physical restraints, malnutrition, more than three medications, presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, and ‘any iatrogenic event’ were identified by Inouye and Charpentier (1996). They also propose sleep deprivation, sensory impairment, existing cognitive impairment, poor hydration and nutritional status and immobility as risk factors (Inouye & Charpentier 1996). Some of the risk factors identified clinically are: • large number of medications • drug and alcohol use / misuse or withdrawal • dehydration and poor nutrition • hepatic or renal dysfunction • electrolyte disturbance • sensory impairment • sleep deprivation • existing cognitive impairment / brain damage • pain • respiratory / cardiovascular disease • infection • immobility Stephen Harding MMHN CCMH CertPsych CredMHN RN, Lecturer, School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of South Australia Email: sharding@netspace.net.au Continuing Professional Development Managing delirium in older people",

The commonest illicit drug is cannabis. Others include lysergide (LSD), which like cannabis is obtained wholly from unlawful sources. Amphetamines (and other central nervous stimulants) and barbiturates (and other central nervous de pressants) are also taken illicitly though their source originally may have been legitimate for example, they may have been stolen from pharmacies or overprescribed by doctors. Finally, opiates may find their way on to the black market from diversion of prescribed drugs on the one hand to smuggling of Chinese heroin on the other.",

      "abstract": "Behaviour disorders resulting from localized lesions of the brain have attracted increasing attention recently. With the rapid progress being made in neurosurgical treatment there is a prospect that their accurate diagnosis may become more than an academic exercise. In the present paper a description will be presented of characteristic overactive behaviour which appears, in the majority of cases, to be due to cortical damage, frequently involving the temporal lobe, and sustained either at the time of birth or in later childhood. The behaviour symptoms exhibited were remarkably constant throughout the series of twenty-five children studied. There was marked restlessness, distractibility and an inability to concentrate for more than a few seconds at a time. The affected children showed an apparent compulsive need to touch every object which they saw, and to suck or chew them. Outbursts of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour occurred frequently, and the patients seemed to be incapable of responding to reprimand or chastisement for longer than a few minutes. The majority suffered from epilepsy or showed other evidence suggesting the presence of cerebral damage on examination.",

The amorphous nature of this experience has made identifying its etiology challenging, but recent advances in neurology and understanding of implicit memory and attention are helping to clarify this cognitive illusion. More specifically, déjà vu may result from (a) a brief change in normal neural transmission speed causing a slightly longer separation between identical messages received from two separate pathways, (b) a brief split in a continuous perceptual experience that is caused by distractions (external or internal) and gives the impression of two separate perceptual events, and (c) the activation of implicit familiarity for some portion (or all) of the present experience without an accompanying conscious recollection of the prior encounter.

      "title": "Course and outcome of schizophrenia and their prediction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Studies conducted over many decades consistently demonstrate that schizophrenia presents a broad spectrum of possible outcomes and course patterns, ranging from complete or nearly complete recovery after acute episodes of psychosis to continuous, unremitting illness leading to progressive deterioration of cognitive performance and social functioning. Between these extremes, a substantial proportion of patients show an episodic course with relapses of psychotic symptoms and partial remissions during which affective and cognitive impairments become increasingly conspicuous and may progress to gross deficits. Although no less than one-third of all patients with schizophrenia have relatively benign outcomes, in the majority the illness still has a profound, lifelong impact on personal growth and development. The initial symptoms of the disorder are not strongly predictive of the pattern of course but the mode of onset (acute or insidious), the duration of illness prior to diagnosis and treatment, the presence or absence of comorbid substance use, as well as background variables such as premorbid adjustment (especially during adolescence), educational and occupational achievement, marital status, and availability of a supportive social network allow a reasonable accuracy of prediction in the short- to medium-term (2–5 years). One of the most striking aspects of the longitudinal course of schizophrenia is the so-called ‘terminal improvement’. A relatively high proportion of patients tend to improve substantially with ageing. What determines this long-term outcome is far from clear but the stereotype view of schizophrenia as an invariably progressive, deteriorating disorder does not accord well with the evidence. Similarly, a model of schizophrenia as a static neurodevelopmental encephalopathy decompensating post-adolescence under the influence of a variety of stressors fits only part of the spectrum of course patterns. In a significant proportion of cases, the disorder exhibits the unmistakable features of a shift-like process with acute exacerbations and remissions which may progress to severe deterioration or come to a standstill at any stage. Whether a single underlying pathophysiology can explain the variety of clinical outcomes, or several different pathological processes are at work, remains obscure. It has been suggested that the longitudinal course of schizophrenia should be seen as an open-ended, dynamic life process with multiple, interacting biological and psychosocial determinants. Obviously, such issues cannot be resolved by clinical follow-up studies alone, and require a strong involvement of neurobiological research in prospective investigations of representative samples of cases spanning the entire spectrum of course and outcomes. No such studies have been possible until recently, both because of the technical complexity of such an undertaking and because of the tendency to selectively recruit for biological investigations patients from the severe, deteriorating part of the spectrum. Overcoming such limitations will be essential to the uncovering of the mechanisms driving the ‘natural history’ of schizophrenia.",

Depression, the most common mental disorder in later life, is a major precipitating factor in suicide. Alcoholism is another major precipitating factor in late-life suicide. Approximately one-third of all suicides are alcoholics. Many of the same factors which contribute to depression also increase the risk of alcoholism and/or suicide. Loss, stress, loneliness, low self-esteem, and feelings of anxiety, rejection, helplessness, and hopelessness characterize late life alcoholism and depression.

Si ha la contenzione chimica, quando farmaci tranquillanti, sedativi e antidepressivi sono usati senza indicazioni adeguate o per periodi eccessivi di tempo. Nelle istituzioni geriatriche il ricorso al loro uso sembra essere eccessivo, gli ospiti anziani sono spesso in contenzione senza una chiara direttiva medica e per motivazioni non sempre corrette. Da un esame della letteratura e dell’esperienza clinica, gli Autori evidenziano come i mezzi di contenzione non solo non raggiungono quei risultati previsti nelle motivazioni addotte per il loro uso, ma possono comportare effetti collaterali dannosi quale la diminuzione del tono muscolare, ulcere da pressione, disturbi circolari, e anche la morte. Da un punto di vista etico legare l’ospite anziano assume costantemente connotazioni negative e suggerisce sempre privazioni di autonomia, annullamento della persona. Se e quando la contenzione deve essere adottata, questo deve avvenire dopo che si siano esaminati tutti gli interventi alternativi possibili, e deve essere sempre prescritta da un medico ed accuratamente registrata sia per la modalita usata la meno coercitiva possibile che per il tempo che si rende necessaria.

      "abstract": "Depression is a common emotional state in humans, which is sometimes triggered by stressful events and certain physical and/or mental conditions that may occur and may increase the body's vulnerability to various types of depressive disorders, causing sometimes organic changes difficult to quantify and to treat. Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "title": "Mechanistic basis of adverse drugreactions: the perils of inappropriate dose schedules",
      "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have long been recognised as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. They account for a substantial number of clinical consultations, hospital admissions and extended duration of in-patient stay as well as mortality. By far the most common ADRs are the concentration-dependent pharmacological reactions, the majority of which ought to be preventable. As a result of high concentrations of the parent drug and/or its metabolite(s), there is an augmentation of primary pharmacological activity and/or appearance of new and undesirable secondary pharmacological activity. Typically, these high concentrations result from administration of high doses in an attempt to maximise efficacy and/or modulation of the pharmacokinetics of a drug by either genetic or non-genetic factors. High plasma concentrations of parent drug may result from inherited impairment or drug-induced inhibition of its pharmacokinetic disposition. Conversely, inherited overcapacity or drug-induced induction of the metabolism of a drug may result in low concentrations of parent drug and frequently, rapid accumulation of its metabolites. Environmental, dietary and phytochemical factors may also influence the activity of drug metabolising enzymes. As with inherited polymorphisms of acetylation and cytochrome P450-based drug metabolising enzymes, polymorphisms of other conjugation reactions, such as glucuronidation, increasingly appear to be associated with drug toxicity. Diseases of organs involved in elimination of a drug also alter its pharmacokinetics, plasma concentration and, therefore, the profile of its concentration-dependent ADRs. Inherited mutations, concurrently administered drugs or presence of certain diseases may also alter the sensitivity of some pharmacological targets, accounting for a substantial number of ADRs and interactions. When there is enhanced pharmacodynamic sensitivity, plasma drug concentrations that are apparently within the normal 'non-toxic' range give rise to ADRs. Recent advances have also provided important insights into the wider scope of drug–drug interactions. Interactions that occur at P-glycoproteins, drug transporters and efflux pumps, at various transmembrane interfaces such as the gastrointestinal wall, renal tubules, hepatobiliary border and blood–brain barrier, are beginning to explain many non-metabolic interactions. These alter the systemic exposure to drugs and have so far, begun to explain unexpected neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The function of these transporters is also genetically modulated. These advances, together with continued increased awareness and education of prescribers and pharmacists, offer great opportunities for substantially minimising concentration-related ADRs.",

New Results: Chronic drug use indeed impacts negatively on human's cognitive functions, especially in terms of attention, learning, and memory. With increasing amount of certain drug use, the degree of impairments also increases. It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

Examples of such endogenous molecules include glutamate, bilirubin, nitric oxide, histamine, while alcohol or carbon monoxide represents exogenous insults. Such alterations in the neurons are sometimes not limited to functions, but also involve the anatomy, i.e. the cell structure, of the neurons. The term “neuronopathy” refers to the death (necrosis or apoptosis) of the neuronal cell, and a dead neuron cannot be replaced by new neurons. Types of neurotoxicity other than neuronopathy include axonopathy, myelinopathy, or blockade of the neurotransmission. The duration and intensity of exposure to neurotoxic insult has a significant role on the outcome of the toxic effect. Most of the neurotoxins act by impairing the voltage-dependent ion canals",

Police personnel report markedly reduced passion for their job, leading to chronic stress, burnout, and quitting the law enforcement profession due to the effects of prolonged and unpleasant behavioural patterns. According to Zeidner and Saklofske, examples of ineffective coping strategies that have implications in law enforcement include the excessive use of alcohol, tobacco, sudden explosive anger, hallucinogenic drugs, impatience, anger, and verbal or physical confrontation. Behaviour may be a mediating variable in experiencing job-related stress in law enforcement, and among dispatchers, in particular. The unique job characteristics of Emergency dispatcher (ED) virtually mandate mastery of avoidance coping, although evidence is lacking that members of law enforcement use the important coping technique. A cognitive strategy is the conscious use of a mental technique intended to alter the person's thoughts, emotions, or performance.",

      "title": "Commentary on Schotte et al. “Development of temporal lobe epilepsy during maintenance electroconvulsive therapy: A case of human kindling?”",
      "abstract": "Kindling is a phenomenon whereby repeated subthreshold stimulations for inducing a particular initial behavior eventually produce that behavior, and with further stimulations additional behaviors are observed.1 It is a model of learning, memory, and epileptogenesis/epilepsy; the latter is because the measured behavior is most often a seizure that becomes progressively more severe. For example, in kindling of the limbic structures in adult rodents, the Racine scale is used.2 These seizures are initially focal and then become bilateral clonic3-5 and eventually tonic (Table 1).2 In experimental studies, kindling can be induced by a variety of electrical or chemical stimuli.3, 4, 6-16 Another form of kindling is the progressive intensification of bilateral (probably generalized) seizures triggered by repeated administration of chemoconvulsants such as flurothyl with associated decrease in the latencies of the onset of the convulsions.17 In almost all the studies, the data suggest that focal seizures eventually become bilateral or the bilateral seizures become more severe. There is only one observation that with repeated audiogenic stimulation in one strain of rats (genetically epilepsy prone rats [GEPR-3]), after a series of bilateral seizures (which are presumed to be of brainstem origin), focal electroencephalography (EEG) discharges appeared in the amygdala with seizure types reminiscent of the Racine stages 1-3.18, 19 The notion that kindling may occur in human epilepsies has been proposed and debated since the first description of the phenomenon by Graham Goddard in 1967.1 There are several excellent reviews on the topic describing the pros and cons of the available studies5, 20 and the evidence is at best scant. This may be due, in part, to the greater number of stimulations needed to elicit kindling, the higher the animal is on the phylogenetic scale.5 Schotte et al21 presented a 67-year-old right-handed woman with no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures, who had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions for medically refractory bipolar disease. She received weekly bilateral temporal ECT for 9 years before being switched to right temporal ECT (weekly initially; then reduced to every other week), due to concerns of cognitive deterioration. In parallel, she had been receiving valproate, among other medications, for management of her bipolar disorder. After 17 years and 800 sessions of bilateral or unilateral ECT, and after reducing the sessions from weekly to every other week, she started manifesting epileptic seizures consisting of hyperventilation, tachycardia, impaired awareness, oral and left hand automatisms, and postictal aphasia. Her video-EEG monitoring captured left more than right temporal epileptic discharges and ictal seizure patterns with bilateral onset, although lateralizing electroclinical signs were suggested (reported as starting at or rapidly propagating to the left temporal, although electrographic onset remains unclear). Subtraction ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) coregistered with MRI (SISCOM) showed left hyperperfusion, and interictal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with anatomy-corrected asymmetry index analysis showed bilateral but greater on the left hemisphere hypometabolism. No obvious association between the timing of ECT sessions and her seizures was observed. The authors propose that this presentation may be a form of ECT kindling of the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans. In this case, this will resemble the studies in the GEPR-3 audiogenic-prone rats and one would have to assume that the ECT seizures are of brainstem origin. Prior reports of epilepsy diagnosed after many episodes of ECT included focal or bilateral onset seizures, while epileptic activity after bitemporal ECT or ipsilateral temporal onset seizures have been reported after unilateral ECT22, 23 and often subside after ECT discontinuation. However, as was the case in the patient described by Schotte et al, ECT discontinuation may not always be possible due to the severity of depression. However, there is an alternative hypothesis that should be considered. The 800 ECT seizures recorded prior to clinical seizure onset could have produced hippocampal injury, and the observed seizures may be a reflection of this injury. The observed cognitive deterioration, reported before the onset of clinical seizures, is supportive evidence. It is also possible that this injury may have been exacerbated by the focal delivery of ECT via a right temporal lobe electrode. This hypothesis could be considered in the interpretation of the data. Of interest, although bilateral temporal pathologies were observed, the interictal pathology (FDG-PET) as well as the lateralizing signs on the ictal SISCOM and electroclinical manifestations showed a preponderance of left temporal pathology, that is, contralateral to the right temporal ECT sessions. If ECT is indeed implicated in the development of TLE in this patient, whether directly by kindling or indirectly as a result of the ensuing temporal lobe pathology, what are the mechanisms responsible for the greater pathology and epileptogenesis at a contralateral focus? Paradoxical lateralizing signs (eg, postictal expressive and receptive aphasia with or without right gaze deviation and right-sided motor signs) have been reported very rarely after right unilateral ECTs of right-handed patients, either immediately after the ECT or postrecovery (“tardive seizures”).24, 25 These have been postulated to reflect “stunning” of eloquent regions after ECT seizure generalization, although it is also likely that underlying predisposing conditions or coadministered drugs may render some patients more vulnerable to manifesting persisting or reactivated seizure foci, contralateral to the ECT. Certainly, the frequency of these paradoxical associations is too low to confirm causality. Furthermore, pre-ECT data on neuroimaging or video-EEG monitoring to determine preexisting pathologies at the contralateral site are missing. The chronic concomitant use of valproate or benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in some of these patients,21, 25 may have masked or delayed the onset of the clinical manifestations of prior epilepsy. On the contrary, could the unilateral ECT have protected the ipsilateral temporal lobe from injury or propensity to manifest or sustain ictal activity?21, 24, 25 Electroconvulsive seizures result in a period of postictal refractoriness to seizures or epileptic activity26, 27 that may contribute to apparent antiseizure effects. Bilateral ECT has been used to stop superrefractory status epilepticus,28-30 although most studies have been retrospective or case reports, thus warranting further confirmation with prospective studies before recommending its use. Unknowns and possible confounders include the ECT effects on blood-brain barrier permeability and its potential effects on seizure activity or the brain penetration of coadministered drugs (including antiseizure drugs), vascular and cerebral blood flow changes after ECT, direct effects of (unilateral or bilateral) ECT on seizure propensity, comorbidities, and the reciprocal influences of the concomitant brain pathologies due to psychiatric and other comorbidities. Additional factors potentially controlling outcomes are the impact of ECT electrode placement and stimulation protocol on the function of and connectivity patterns within a network that has already been altered by the comorbid conditions and individual factors that may modify the effects of all these interactions. We commend the authors for reviving these interesting and clinically important questions through their “concept and hypothesis” manuscript prompted by their case report. Despite certain, and often unavoidable, practical limitations, inherent to everyday clinical practice, that prevent definitive conclusions, the implications for future systematic research in this area are important. To date the evidence that kindling occurs in humans is still at best questioned. Time will tell.

      "title": "Molecular and behavioral aspects of the actions of alcohol on the adult and developing brain",
      "abstract": "The brain is one of the major target organs of alcohol actions. Alcohol abuse can lead to alterations in brain structure and functions and, in some cases, to neurodegeneration. Cognitive deficits and alcohol dependence are highly damaging consequences of alcohol abuse. Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the developing brain is particularly vulnerable to alcohol, and that drinking during gestation can lead to a range of physical, learning and behavioral defects (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders), with the most dramatic presentation corresponding to fetal alcohol syndrome. Recent findings also indicate that adolescence is a stage of brain maturation and that heavy drinking at this stage can have a negative impact on brain structure and functions causing important short- and long-term cognitive and behavioral consequences. The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform; some brain areas or cell populations are more vulnerable than others. The prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, the white matter and glial cells are particularly susceptible to the effects of ethanol.The molecular actions of alcohol on the brain are complex and involve numerous mechanisms and signaling pathways. Some of the mechanisms involved are common for the adult brain and for the developing brain, while others depend on the developmental stage. During brain ontogeny, alcohol causes irreversible alterations to the brain structure. It also impairs several molecular, neurochemical and cellular events taking place during normal brain development, including alterations in both gene expression regulation and the molecules involved in cell–cell interactions, interference with the mitogenic and growth factor response, enhancement of free radical formation and derangements of glial cell functions. However, in both adult and adolescent brains, alcohol damages specific brain areas through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, free radical formation and neuroinflammatory damage resulting from activation of the innate immune system mediated by TLR4 receptors.Alcohol also acts on specific membrane proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors (e.g. NMDA, GABA-A), ion channels (e.g. L-type Ca2+ channels, GIRKs), and signaling pathways (e.g. PKA and PKC signaling). These effects might underlie the wide variety of behavioral effects induced by ethanol drinking. The neuroadaptive changes affecting neurotransmission systems which are more sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol occur after long-term alcohol consumption. Alcohol-induced maladaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system, abnormal plastic changes in the reward-related brain areas and genetic and epigenetic factors may all contribute to alcohol reinforcement and alcohol addiction.This manuscript reviews the mechanisms by which ethanol impacts the adult and the developing brain, and causes both neural impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. The identification and the understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity might contribute to the development of treatments and/or therapeutic agents that could reduce or eliminate the deleterious effects of alcohol on the brain.",

      "abstract": "The kidneys can be injured in diverse ways by many drugs, both legal and illegal. Novel associations and descriptions of nephrotoxic effects of common and emerging drugs of abuse have appeared over the past several years. Anabolic androgenic steroids, illicitly used by athletes and others for decades to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat, are emerging as podocyte toxins given recent descriptions of severe forms of FSGS in long-term abusers. Synthetic cannabinoids, a new group of compounds with marijuana-like effects, recently became popular as recreational drugs and have been associated with an atypical form of AKI. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy, is a widely used synthetic recreational drug with mood-enhancing properties and a constellation of toxicities that can result in death. These toxic effects include hyperthermia, hypotonic hyponatremia due to its arginine vasopressin secretagogue-like effects, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular collapse. Cocaine, a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that serves as an illegal stimulant, appetite suppressant, and anesthetic, also causes vasoconstriction and rhabdomyolysis. Recent adulteration of much of the world's supply of cocaine with levamisole, an antihelminthic agent with attributes similar to but distinct from those of cocaine, appears to have spawned a new type of ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis. This review discusses the nephrotoxic effects of these common and emerging drugs of abuse, of which both community and health care providers should become aware given their widespread abuse. Future investigation into pathogenetic mechanisms associated with these drugs is critical and may provide a window into ways to lessen and even prevent the nephrotoxic effects of these drugs of abuse and perhaps allow a deeper understanding of the nephrotoxicities themselves.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and dental anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues; anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay / intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. Genetic counseling ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a multifaceted disorder characterized by multiple motor and at least one vocal tics that start in childhood, persist for at least 1 year, and cannot be attributed to another medical condition or exposure to medications/drugs. Clinical diagnostic criteria are available, and identification of tics is typically straightforward based on characteristic appearance and features. Diagnostic uncertainty can rarely arise in cases of mild tics, atypical features, certain psychiatric comorbidities, and other non-tic movement disorders. Comorbid psychopathology, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive behaviors/obsessive-compulsive disorder, affects the majority of patients and is correlated with disease severity and the presence of additional psychiatric behaviors. The severity of tics often improves after adolescence, whereas psychiatric symptoms typically persist. The subset of patients in whom tics persist into adulthood experience higher rates of anxiety, and lower self-esteem, socioeconomic status, and quality of life; the relative contribution of motor tics and psychopathology is not fully understood. This article summarizes the clinical features of Tourette syndrome, including major diagnostic criteria, unique features of tics, and key aspects that differentiate tics from common mimics and chameleons. Comorbid psychiatric conditions and their impact on phenotype and quality of life are described. Finally, current understanding of the natural history is summarized, including limited research in adults with Tourette syndrome.",

High rates of burnout have been observed in a wide range of professions, including healthcare and teaching; burnout has also been observed in unpaid work such as caregiving and parenting. Burnout is associated with reduced work performance and poor self-image, in addition to adverse mental and physical health outcomes ranging from major depressive disorder to type 2 diabetes. Burnout may influence health outcomes primarily via changes in health behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, but some evidence suggests that burnout can impact health independently of health behaviors. While the physiological underpinnings of burnout remain poorly understood, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and changes in DNA methylation patterns may be involved. Various interventions to reduce or prevent burnout have been tested; while mindfulness- and exercise-based interventions appear promising, results have been inconsistent. Further prospective research using higher-quality designs is needed to improve the scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of burnout.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children.

A range of research recently reviewed by the TAC also highlights that as drivers age, there is a higher prevalence of medication usage for health purposes, but the use of these medications can often and unknowingly, impair driving ability. Taking multiple medications increases the chance that driving will be impaired. Likewise, mixing of drugs with alcohol also has the potential to increase the level of impairment. Main classes of drugs that are impairing include anxiety, depression, any emotional condition, cold and cough, antihistamines, and epilepsy drugs. The TAC has undertaken a project to provide all drivers (but primarily those aged 60 years and over) with up-to-date information and associated safety advice about specific pharmacy medications and how they can impair driving ability/judgment, so that they can make an informed decision about their driving capabilities. This paper will describe the research and development of this initiative, including the comprehensive stakeholder engagement process.",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is caused by an extreme event that occurs unexpectedly and suddenly, is life-threatening or is perceived to be so, and has an intense impact on the senses of the person involved. A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

      "abstract": "The repertoire of behavioral symptoms depends on the degree of severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to cognitive symptoms such as memory loss and language impairment, patients with AD often develop behavioral symptoms. While cognitive symptoms are required for the diagnosis of AD and are relentlessly progressive, behavioral symptoms are not inevitable, usually fluctuate in severity, and may be intermittent or transient. Before initiating treatment, the physician must determine whether physical illness, medications, or environmental or interpersonal factors are contributing to the behavioral symptoms. Elderly patients are more sensitive than younger adults to medication effects and side effects. The combination of aging and AD produces marked deficits of brain neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Delusions and hallucinations occur most often in patients with AD who have mild to moderately severe dementia. Anxiety is relatively uncommon in patients with AD. Several classes of medications may be used, most of which can produce tolerance with long-term use.",

Ictal semiology may vary depending on the etiology, age at onset, and cerebral areas involved in the epileptogenic network. In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE. No randomized data about treatment are available. Structural epilepsies or coexistent unprovoked seizures other than eating seizures are poor prognostic factors for pharmacological outcome.",

Symptoms commonly include hallucinations, mostly of the auditory type, and affective disturbances, in a background of clear consciousness. In this case series, four subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption were evaluated for hallucinatory symptoms after chronic alcohol intake. All of them had auditory hallucinations, with an anxious affect and no cognitive deficits. Only one case had visual hallucinations. The psychotic symptoms in all the patients were completely remitted with antipsychotics. Resumption of alcohol consumption increases the risk of relapse. The pathophysiology of alcoholic hallucinosis is not yet established and needs to be studied further for better diagnosis and management.",

Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes.

      "title": "Conversion disorder: understanding the pathogenic links between emotion and motor systems in the brain",
      "abstract": "When neurology and psychiatry moved apart from each other around the turn of the 20th century, casualties included the many patients with unexplained neurological disorders. Many labels have been applied to these patients. Some are descriptive (functional disorders, medically unexplained symptoms), while others refer to a presumed aetiology (psychogenic, hysteria, non-organic) or putative mechanism (dissociative or conversion disorder). Whatever is the label, for some physicians these patients are among the most interesting and challenging in the clinic. For others they are frustrating, using much time and resources for an often disappointing outcome.\n\nWhether you are an enthusiast or nihilist, it is clear that that neither neurology nor psychiatry alone have succeeded in sufficiently advancing our neurobiological understanding or management of these disorders. The slow progress is in stark contrast to the scale of the problem. Medically unexplained neurological symptoms account for ∼30% of referred neurology out-patients (Carson et al. , 2000; Stone et al. , 2009). Conversion disorder alone, explicitly associated with psychological stressors at the outset, accounts for ∼5% of referrals and is a stable, accurate diagnosis (Perkin, 1989; Stone et al. , 2005, 2009).\n\nPsychogenic movement disorders are common in neurological practice, including tremor, dystonia, gait change and paralysis. Diagnostic criteria emphasize clinical observations such as inconsistency, distractibility and false neurological signs (Fahn and Williams, 1988). These can be both sensitive and specific, at least in the context of a movement disorder clinic (Shill and Gerber, 2006). Physiological criteria have also been developed, such as coherence of tremor oscillations distinguishing psychogenic from organic syndromes (McAuley and Rothwell, 2004). The emphasis in this ‘neurological’ approach is on the physical examination, supplemented by physiological tests. The psychological aspects of the disease take second place, e.g. requiring ‘obvious’ but not specified psychiatric or emotional disturbance (Fahn and Williams, 1988 …",

The patient had a history of nephrotic syndrome and for this reason, required prednisolone. The corticosteroid induced irritability that has appeared three months after the treatment has started. The psychiatric examination showed neither the psychomotor retardation, manic or depressed mood, nor hallucinations and delusions. However, the level of irritability was undoubtedly increased. Conclusions: Corticosteroids are drugs commonly used in many systemic diseases. During a psychiatric examination, a careful evaluation is necessary to distinguish the side effects of corticosteroids from the primary psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Interventions for the Prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Sudden Unexplained Death in Infancy: A Review of Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden and unexplained death of an infant under the age of one (i.e., death for which a cause is not found even after a thorough investigation including review of clinical history, examination of death scene and a complete autopsy). Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) also known as Sudden unexplained infant death is a term used to describe sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant for which external risk factors may be present. SUDI is a blanket term that encompasses SIDS, other unexplained infant deaths, and explained infant suffocations. SIDS and SUDI are not diagnoses. Risk factors for SIDS fall under three groups: intrinsic risk factors (e.g., male sex, prematurity, exposure to cigarette smoke), extrinsic risk factors (e.g., prone or side sleep position, bed sharing, overheating) and exogenous factors (e.g., ethnicity, climate, geographical location). It has been shown that racial and ethnic disparities (such as Indigenous peoples and other racial minorities) and vulnerabilities (such as low socioeconomic status, fewer social supports, those experiencing problems with housing, violence or mental illness) may contribute to increased risk of SIDS.,In Canada, the incidence of SUDI was the highest in 1980 with a rate of 2.07 SUDI per 1,000 live births. The rates of SUDI and SIDS have since decreased, especially since the 1990s. In 2018, there were ten deaths classified as SIDS in Canada. A global decrease in the incidence of SIDS can be attributed to widespread “Back-to-Sleep” campaigns, which were aimed to promote placing babies in a supine position for sleeping., Several similar risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on sleep position, have been implemented globally with the aim of reducing the incidence of SIDS and SUDI., The “Back-to-sleep” campaign was later expanded to the “Safe-to-sleep” campaign in 2012 to involve new and evolved evidence for preventing SIDS. As a result of continued research, guidelines regarding the prevention of SIDS and SUDI have been developed and updated throughout the last three decades.A previous CADTH Summary of Abstracts report, published in 2016, briefly summarized evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of SIDS. The purpose of this report is to summarize and critically appraise evidence-based guidelines that were published within the last five years regarding interventions for the prevention of SIDS or SUDI.",

RÉSUMÉ Le traitement à base de Zarontin, surtout à forte dose et à certaines périodes critiques du développement de l'enfant (adolescence) est susceptible d'engendrer des troubles psychiques profonds affectant à la fois la sphère intellectuelle et affective. On peut se demander si d'autres médications anti‐comitiales ne produiraient pas chez l'enfant des effets similaires. Des études comparatives objectives restent à faire. En clinique, un contrôle psychologique de l'effet des thérapeutiques s'avère utile si on veut éviter des perturbations psychiques susceptibles d'entraîner à la longue chez l'enfant de graves inadaptations intellectuelles et affectives.",

      "abstract": "The utility of classical drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) is often limited by issues of lack of efficacy, delayed onset of action or side effects. Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.",

      "title": "he dependence of the clinical picture of acute psychosis connected with alcohol withdrawal from the forms of alcohol consumption",
      "abstract": "210 patients with acute psychotic disorder in a state of alcohol withdrawal were examined. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "title": "A case of clozapine-induced stuttering in a HIV-positive individual",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Stuttering, a speech disorder marked by disruptions in fluency, can be developmental or acquired. Acquired stuttering often stems from neurological causes, psychological trauma or certain medications, with antipsychotics such as clozapine implicated in several cases. Clozapine, particularly at higher doses, has been associated with dose-dependent stuttering although the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. While clozapine’s effects dopamine pathways and seizure thresholds are proposed mechanisms, movement disorders such as focal dystonia and prior extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSEs) are also implicated. Patient presentation: A 40-year-old man with HIV, schizophrenia and a history of previous severe dystonic reaction to typical antipsychotics, developed stuttering after initiation of clozapine. His stuttering was accompanied by involuntary oral movements. Management and outcome: The patient’s psychotic symptoms were found to be treatment-resistant, unresponsive to trials of two antipsychotics, and thus necessitating the initiation of clozapine. Following clozapine administration, the patient developed stuttering, which was unresponsive to benzodiazepine therapy and showed no abnormalities on electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment. Gradual resolution of stuttering was observed upon clozapine discontinuation and a switch to amisulpiride. Conclusion: Clozapine was identified as the likely cause of stuttering in the presence of additional risk factors such as HIV and a history of EPSEs. Contribution: This case highlights the importance of recognising clozapine-induced stuttering.",

The ‘treatment’ for reactive anxiety and depressive symptoms is education, reassurance, and a good plan to get the patient’s life back on track. If the patient has an impairing (but not immediately dangerous) mood disorder, it can be treated for the most part just like a mood disorder in the absence of concussion. The optimal approach usually involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions: exercise, treat sleep disturbances, psychological counseling, avoid substances that worsen mood overall such as alcohol and street drugs, consider appropriate long-term antidepressant /antianxiety medications. There are many options, and side effects can be the limiting factor. There has been recent interest in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment for depression in concussion patients.",

Patients complain of a chronic change in perceptions concerning their own self (depersonalization) or their surrounding (derealization) lasting months and often years. They perceive themselves and/or their environment as unreal; as if they are in a dream; as if they are detached from themselves and their surroundings by an invisible wall; or as if they are observers of the self without any connection to physical or mental processes. Often, patients are incorrectly treated with antipsychotics under a misdiagnosed psychotic illness, or the disorder remains unconsidered in differential diagnoses despite the patients' immense suffering. First-line treatment is psychotherapy with no current approved drug treatments. Psychoeducation and grounding exercises might be sufficient for mild cases without significant impairment of personality functioning. In patients with more distress and impairment of personality functioning, an affect-focused psychodynamic approach is helpful, which simultaneously deals with impaired affect-tolerance and the massive affect-phobia and detachment.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

      "title": "Acute Bronchial Asthma",
      "abstract": "Four hundred and six asthmatic attacks occurred in 9 patients with severe, chronic bronchial asthma who had been studied intensively in psychiatric or (in two instances) psychoanalytic interviews. Feelings and fantasies concomitant with asthma tended to be dominated by absorption in the physical illness. At times this appeared to serve as a protection against obvious psychological problems. In somewhat more than half of the episodes other emotional concomitants appeared after asthma had become established. The vast majority of these were depressive--a sense of sadness, helplessness, and hopelessness, at times accompanied by ideas of a dangerous or poisonous inner substance. Contrasting with these, in somewhat less than half of the attacks there were prodromal emotionaxl manifestations which preceded and led directly into acute asthma. The principal prodromal feature was excitement, usually with an angry or anxious coloring, occasionally elated and erotic, resembling a miniature hypomania. We suggest that in asthma an initial phase of drive arousal and excitement is followed by a later phase of drive restraint and inhibition. Antecedent changes in the environment occurring in the 48 hours prior to an attack varied widely. Eight categories could be discerned, the two most prominent being loss of a person and closeness to a person. Most of the categories could be divided into one of two groups: events which seemed to lead to frustration of powerful impulses and those which seemed to stimulate erotized or dangerous wishes. We postulate that both types of event, although neither is of itself specific for asthma, might activate a respiratory apparatus having both intake and expulsion functions, which has become vulnerable to psychological as well as physiological stress.",

Apart from drug rashes (discussed in the previous chapter), these idiosyncratic reactions can include hepatic, pancreatic, hematologic, neurologic, immunologic, or central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. These reactions can be unpredictable, but when they do occur, these typically arise within weeks of drug initiation and may be reversed when the drug is stopped. The management of idiosyncratic reactions depends on the manifestations and severity. Potentially life-threatening reactions warrant rapid drug discontinuation, with initiation of an alternative ASM with little cross-reactivity to prevent seizures. Other reactions can be managed with slower substitutions or with the addition of other drugs.",

      "abstract": "Potential drug interactions encountered at the end of life may be cumbersome to predict and have significant impact on the palliation of symptoms. Recent advances in identifying metabolic pathways and metabolites of frequently used medications allow clinicians to consider the fate and pharmacodynamic effects of drugs prescribed. Numerous medications used in the palliative care population undergo hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism to active and inactive metabolites. Hepatic reactions rendering medications prepared for excretion or removal from the system are complex, but may be summarised for medications frequently used in end-of-life care as Phase 1 oxidation, hydroxylation, and reduction reactions, and Phase 2 glucuronidation reactions. Both general types of drug metabolism pathways may be altered by medications, disease states, and normal ageing processes. Specific to end-of-life care, Phase 1 reactions may become less robust, while Phase 2 reactions are typically preserved. Benzodiazepines, opioids, non-opioid analgesics, and hypnotics may all exhibit additive or reduced efficacy when given concurrently with medications which inhibit or induce these pathways. Unexpected dose-related toxicity or adverse effects may also manifest. In summary, understanding and anticipating potential drug interactions in end of life and palliative care is paramount for the health professional.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy occurs in humans and animals. It is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders worldwide, but with the availability of modern diagnostic tools and therapeutic measures the outcome has been increasingly improved during the last years. Disregarding these achievements, about one third of the epilepsies remains refractory to treatment and requires special attention of treating epileptologists and basic scientists. Refractory epilepsy is associated with a high prevalence of complications such as sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, poor adherence, cognitive decline, long-term side effects, and a poor outcome. In case of refractory epilepsy, alternative therapies to antiepileptic drugs should be considered which include ketogenic diet, hypothermia, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, propofol, ketamine, inhalative anesthetics, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation, or epilepsy surgery. Particularly status epilepticus, which may be convulsive or nonconvulsive, requires aggressive emergency treatment. With the invention and approval of new therapeutic agents, it should be possible to further narrow the segment of intractable epilepsies, not only in human but also in veterinary patients. Experimental and spontaneous animal models are used to find clinically useful therapies for symptomatic management of epilepsies and to understand the basic pathomechanism of novel forms of epilepsies.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology and treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH) is a medical condition that can occur during physical exertion. Initially, EAH was considered to be restricted to extreme endurance activities, such as ultramarathons and Ironman triathlons. However, it has been more recently recognized in a variety of sports, including team sports and in shorter-duration events. The pathophysiology of EAH is multifactorial and includes excessive fluid intake and non-osmotic arginine vasopressin secretion, which is induced by physical activity. Sodium loss through sweat appears to play a less important role in contributing to EAH. The clinical presentation may vary, depending on the degree of serum sodium reduction. Symptoms, which are due to increased intracranial pressure, may vary from nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion to severe alterations in cognitive functions, decorticate posturing, respiratory distress, coma and even death. It is of pivotal importance to differentiate EAH from other conditions that may present with similar signs/symptoms, such as for instance hypoglycemia, orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, heat stroke. The treatment of EAH depends on the severity of symptoms. In life-threatening situations intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline solution (3%NaCl) is recommended. In less severe situations oral hypertonic saline solutions can be administered, as an alternative to intravenous hypertonic saline, when tolerated by patients. When symptoms are negligible, the treatment can be limited to fluid restriction. Effective strategies to prevent EAH would be important to reduce the risk of incurring in potentially life-threatening situations. In particular, recommendations to drink in anticipation of thirst during physical exertions should be replaced by the “drinking when thirsty” strategy.",

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Options go beyond laxatives and include behavioural treatment as well as new drugs \n\nAlthough slow to emerge, major advances have occurred in understanding the causes and management of constipation. It now receives the attention deserved of a symptom that affects a quarter of the population at some time. Most important is the recognition that different pathophysiological processes can result in the final common symptoms of decreased bowel frequency or impaired rectal evacuation. Different clinical syndromes require different therapeutic approaches.\n\nBowel frequency is influenced by several factors including intake of dietary fibre, emotional make up, and psychological morbidity. Introspective individuals have a lower bowel frequency and produce less stool than extroverts. Infrequent bowel actions in the absence of symptoms can be regarded as part of the normal spectrum of bowel frequency. Low bowel frequency is more common in women.\n\nControlled cross sectional studies have shown that psychological morbidity is commonly associated with severe constipation.1 In some patients it is the key causative factor. Other factors include childhood problems such as sexual or physical abuse, loss of a parent through death or separation, or disturbed toileting behaviour. Underlying depression is another cause. For some the gut is their “outlet valve” for the normal stresses of living. The pathways between brain and gut that link emotions to bowel function have been largely characterised and shown to involve cerebral corticotrophin releasing factor and efferent autonomic pathways. Although psychological factors should be sought at …",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse has become a social and medical problem. Amphetamine and cocaine have a potent sympathicomimetic action, so they have important effects on the Central Nervous and Cardiovascular Systems. Their neurological complications are principally: psychic alterations, seizures and stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic). The latter are the most important in the clinical practice. Their capacity to produce transit arterial hypertension and cerebral vascular constriction could be the physiopathological substrate of such alterations. Angiographic studies have shown lesions suggesting vasculopathy. In the last ten years cocaine abuse has become an authentic epidemic. We have reviewed its neurological complications, particularly the vascular ones--42 hemorrhagic and 24 ischemic--and the following conclusions were drawn: it should be considered as a risk factor in the younger age group; a short period of time between the last drug dose and the clinical picture is frequently seen; clinical features may appear with the first drug administration; no characteristic lesion in relation to the way of administration or consumption time was elicited.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Major risk factors appear to be the severity and/or treatment difficulties, which may be related to the characteristics of the disease but also to mistaken or delayed diagnosis, poor compliance to treatment, and psychosocial problems. Indeed, difficult-to-control asthma symptoms can be caused by other disorders mimicking asthma, by unidentified exacerbating factors, by low compliance with the prescribed therapy, by inability to use the devices correctly (metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, nebulizers) and by low perceptiveness of airway obstruction. Children and adolescents with severe, difficult-to-treat asthma should receive specialist assessment and follow-up.

      "title": "Has the Drug of Choice for Treating Critical Illness Delirium Been Established?",
      "abstract": "Critical illness delirium (hereafter simplified to \"delirium\") is an acute confusional state seen in up to 80% of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness, changes in cognition, perceptual disturbances, a fluctuating course, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, disorientation, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and hallucinations or delusions. 1As a constellation of symptoms and signs that commonly occur together, delirium should not be considered in and of itself a disease, but rather should be thought of as a syndrome, 2 specifically one of acute brain dysfunction that can typically be traced back to one or more inciting causes.The mainstay of therapy, therefore, must aim to address the underlying causes of the syndrome and not simply treat the symptoms.Just as for a patient presenting with new-onset congestive heart failure it would be inappropriate to treat the symptoms by administering furosemide and oxygen without looking for and treating the underlying cause (e.g., an acute coronary syndrome), the drug of choice for delirium cannot simply be the one that best treats the symptoms; rather, it must address the underlying cause.Therefore, the drug of choice to treat any given case of delirium will be patient-and cause-specific.It could be the antibiotic that targets the patient's infection, the free water that addresses the patient's hypernatremia, the laxatives that resolve the patient's constipation, the benzodiazepine that counters the patient's alcohol withdrawal, or the correct treatment that addresses any of the myriad other causes of delirium.The number of potential drivers of delirium is immense, and the reader is encouraged to consult other sources for further information on their assessment and treatment. 1,3,4 Of course, although it is essential to address the underlying etiology of delirium, its symptoms cannot be ignored, as they have the potential to cause significant harm to both the patient and the patient's care team.Anyone who has worked in an ICU for any period of time will have seen a patient with delirium self-extubate or pull out a Foley catheter with the balloon up!Such adverse events can result in significant morbidity and potentially even death. 5 Additionally, patients experiencing delirium can pose a danger to the care team if they become aggressive to the point of striking and injuring care providers.What may be less obvious is that these agitated patients are also at increased risk of morbidity",

      "abstract": "Management of nonpain symptoms can improve quality of life for patients at the end of life and their family members. Constipation is the most common nonpain symptom. It can be related to opioid therapy and/or medical conditions. After abdominal examination to detect masses or evidence of bowel obstruction and rectal examination to exclude fecal impaction, constipation should be managed with a stimulant laxative (eg, senna) or an osmotic laxative (eg, sorbitol). Dyspnea also is common, and often improves with use of a fan to blow air into the face, as well with breathing and relaxation exercises. However, many patients require titrated doses of opioids to address respiratory depression, and anxiolytics such as haloperidol may be needed to manage dyspnea-related anxiety. Oxygen typically is not effective in dyspnea management in nonhypoxemic patients at the end of life. Cough is managed with antitussives. Nausea and vomiting occur in 70% of patients in palliative care units. If no reversible etiology can be identified, dopamine antagonists and motility-enhancing drugs can be used. There are no clearly effective treatments to manage noisy respiratory secretions, but position change, decrease in fluid intake, and drugs such as scopolamine or glycopyrrolate may be effective.",

When a person starts using drugs, it starts getting addicted to them and gradually it can’t help but act on the impulse to use them regardless of the damage caused to the body of addicted person. Drug isn’t about just illegal drugs. A person can get addicted to alcohol, painkillers, nicotine and other legal substances. Drug addiction is a deathly disease found in almost every year of age. The disease is mostly carried by people who are mentally frustrated, physically or mentally abused, facing financial problem or family problems and is desperate to get some sort of relief that comes with the high of drugs even if it proves to be grim for their health in the long run. Addiction starts with the continuous use of dosage of any drug, until the point that an individual starts feeling anxious without the availability of them. Slowly and painfully, these drugs starts making a person totally relied on them and it is basically impossible for the individual to survive without them. There can be many reasons as to why an individual decides to go on this path of addiction. Economic problems, state of utter sadness in case of the death of a loved one or a closed one, societal stress, isolation, aggression, bad or wrong company, in state of depression and anxiety are the most likely situations in which a person starts taking drugs. Along with many other factors, families often play a vital role in pushing an individual towards seeking comfort and relief from the drugs. Developing countries like Pakistan and many others are facing the problem as there are not many effective and active rehabilitation centers. In this research article, the role of families contributing in an individual’s drug addiction is elaborated. This research article is done with the help of many researches, as well as some interviews were conducted regarding certain factors and the answers were given according to the observation and views of responders. The conclusion is drawn with the help of articles and personal opinions and observations regarding how a person leans toward substance or drug usage because of certain family issues and problems.",

      "title": "Adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome show high rates of anxiety and externalizing behaviors but not psychiatric decompensation or skill loss",
      "abstract": "Background FOXP1 syndrome is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder associated with complex clinical presentations including global developmental delay, mild to profound intellectual disability, speech and language impairment, autism traits, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a range of behavioral challenges.. To date, much of the literature focuses on childhood symptoms and little is known about the FOXP1 syndrome phenotype in adolescence or adulthood. Methods A series of caregiver interviews and standardized questionnaires assessed psychiatric and behavioral features of 20 adolescents and adults with FOXP1 syndrome. Interviews captured change in various psychiatric manifestations over time. Medication, social, educational, and vocational history was collected and visual analog scales measured top caregiver concerns during childhood and adolescence/adulthood. Results Anxiety and externalizing behaviors were common in this cohort and psychiatric features, such as psychosis or bipolar symptoms, were present in two participants. There was no reported regression or loss of skills, early in development or during adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adolescence/adulthood. Medication use was common particularly for features of ADHD, although multiple trials were required for some participants to achieve benefit. Standardized assessments accurately picked up on externalizing symptoms and were less sensitive to internalizing symptoms. Educational setting varied up until late elementary school and gradually shifted to special education. Cognitive and developmental concerns were reported as primary during childhood and independence/safety and housing concerns became top concerns by adolescence/adulthood. Caregivers reported continued development in adaptive skills even into adulthood. Conclusions Taken together, results are reassuring, with many families reporting their adolescent and adult children continued to gain skills over time, particularly related to increased independence in communication and personal care. There were no reports of developmental regression, neuropsychiatric decompensation or catatonia.",

Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

Neutral events that occurred both before and after the stressful event were clearly remembered after the electroshock. Clinical studies to be reported elsewhere (I) indicate that the arousal or enhancing of active defensive operations appears to be the most decisive effect of convulsive electroshock treatment. It is probably for that reason that ECT is helpful in those conditions in which defensive operations are at a low ebb, ineffective or exhausted, such as in depression and other severely regressive psychotic states, but that it is ineffective—in fact disturbing—in those conditions in which defensive operations are already too disturbingly alerted, constituting an obstacle to treatment and recovery, such as in anxiety states.",

      "abstract": "Patients reporting sensitivity to multiple chemicals at levels usually tolerated by the healthy population were administered standardized questionnaires to evaluate their symptoms and the exposures that aggravated these symptoms. Many patients were referred for medical tests. It is thought that patients with chemical sensitivity have organ abnormalities involving the liver, nervous system (brain, including limbic, peripheral, autonomic), immune system, and porphyrin metabolism, probably reflecting chemical injury to these systems. Laboratory results are not consistent with a psychologic origin of chemical sensitivity. Substantial overlap between chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome exists: the latter two conditions often involve chemical sensitivity and may even be the same disorder. Other disorders commonly seen in chemical sensitivity patients include headache (often migraine), chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal aching, chronic respiratory inflammation (rhinitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, asthma), attention deficit, and hyperactivity (affected younger children). Less common disorders include tremor, seizures, and mitral valve prolapse. Patients with these overlapping disorders should be evaluated for chemical sensitivity and excluded from control groups in future research. Agents whose exposures are associated with symptoms and suspected of causing onset of chemical sensitivity with chronic illness include gasoline, kerosene, natural gas, pesticides (especially chlordane and chlorpyrifos), solvents, new carpet and other renovation materials, adhesives/glues, fiberglass, carbonless copy paper, fabric softener, formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, carpet shampoos (lauryl sulfate) and other cleaning agents, isocyanates, combustion products (poorly vented gas heaters, overheated batteries), and medications (dinitrochlorobenzene for warts, intranasally packed neosynephrine, prolonged antibiotics, and general anesthesia with petrochemicals). Multiple mechanisms of chemical injury that magnify response to exposures in chemically sensitive patients can include neurogenic inflammation (respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary), kindling and time-dependent sensitization (neurologic), impaired porphyrin metabolism (multiple organs), and immune activation.",

      "title": "Microdosing psychedelics in the treatment of ADHD and comorbid disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Microdosing psychedelics has garnered considerable attention within both nonprofessional circles and the scientific community in recent years. This method involves taking small, non-hallucinogenic doses of substances like LSD or psilocybin over weeks or months, purportedly to enhance specific behaviors, emotions, or address psychiatric conditions. Exploring these assertions is crucial given the potential therapeutic value of microdosing, especially in conditions that respond positively to full psychedelic doses, such as depression. The full psychedelic experience might not always be suitable due to various factors like age, capacity to consent or comprehend the experience (e.g., dementia), or individual personality traits that might hinder surrendering to the experience. Microdosing could potentially serve as a maintenance therapy post-full dose administration, aiding specific psychological or biological processes during therapy or therapeutic exercises. Recent studies in healthy individuals highlight that small psychedelic doses have nuanced effects on pain perception, mood, neuroplasticity, sleep duration, brain connectivity, and default mode network synchronicity. However, some parameters show null effects after both single and repeated administration. Our survey research uncovered that individuals with ADHD reported symptom relief through microdosing, deeming it more effective than their conventional treatments. Subsequently, we conducted a naturalistic study following individuals with ADHD across a 4-week microdosing period. Our findings indicated a reduction in symptoms over time, an increase in trait mindfulness, and a decrease in neuroticism compared to baseline. While these results are intriguing, they necessitate validation in a clinical trial. We have recently concluded such a trial and are currently analyzing the data to further explore these effects.

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "abstract": "Fundamental changes in sleep patterns are associated with normal aging, but disturbed sleep with resultant daytime sleepiness and fatigue is an extremely common occurrence among older persons and a frequent catalyst for physician visits. Sleep disorders result from multiple factors--including pharmacologic, physiologic, biologic, and behavioral--and can be mildly debilitating or life-threatening. Diagnosis includes consideration of the presence of physical or mental illness, drug and/or alcohol use or abuse, a primary sleep disorder such as sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep, changes in circadian rhythms, or poor sleep hygiene. Despite a high rate of use, hypnotics are best suited for periodic rather than chronic sleep disorder symptoms and, in general, should be used only after adjustments in sleep hygiene prove unsuccessful as first-line therapy.",

      "title": "What Do Patients Want in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder? Taiwan’s TAILOR Survey",
      "abstract": "In Taiwan, the number of patients being treated for depression has been increasing over recent decades, but there remain some key unmet needs for these patients. One issue is the low rate of help-seeking, which may be at least partially attributable to the stigma of depression in Asian societies. Stigma also contributes to underdiagnosis, because stigmatised patients may emphasise somatic symptoms (e.g. lethargy/fatigue, sleep disorders or changes in appetite), fearing how they will be perceived if they discuss psychological symptoms with their physician. Underdiagnosis may also result from cross-cultural differences, because assessment scales and screening tools are usually developed in Western populations and may not have the same validity in Asian patients. Depression in Taiwan appears to be undertreated, with a high rate of suboptimal antidepressant dosages and inadequate duration of therapy. Patients may discontinue treatment earlier than recommended for a number of reasons related to their own beliefs about treatment, their relationship with their physicians, or the effects of the medication (adverse effects, slow onset of effect, or lack of effect on comorbid symptoms). Moreover, frequently there is discordance between how patients and physicians define treatment success in depression. Patients are more likely to achieve a benefit from treatment which remains persistent when physicians and patients are closely aligned on treatment goals. To better understand the experiences, preferences and attitudes of patients with depression in Taiwan, the Target Antidepressant Initiation choice to unLock positive patient Outcomes and Response (TAILOR) survey was conducted in 340 adult outpatients receiving treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of the TAILOR survey highlight the personal and perceived stigma of depression, current barriers to seeking help and maintaining treatment, and opportunities to improve shared decision-making, medication adherence and clinical outcomes for Taiwanese patients with MDD.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

Evidence for this linkage comes from a literature review, from patient interviews, from responses to an instrument we have developed (the Self‐Harm Behavior Survey), and from three instructive case reports. Even if the self‐mutilation in these patients is regarded as a Borderline Personality Disorder symptom, DSM‐IV should list it as an associated feature or a complication of Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia Nervosa. In lieu of a dual diagnosis, we postulate that the combination of self‐mutilation, anorexia, bulimia, and other symptoms (such as episodic alcohol abuse and swallowing foreign objects) may be manifestations of an impulse control disorder known as the “deliberate self‐harm syndrome.”",

Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in childhood are food, insect venom, drugs, exercise, etc. In some cases, the presence of more than one trigger is necessary for the allergic reaction, while one trigger alone is tolerated. This rare condition is called summation anaphylaxis (SA). Food‐dependent exercise‐induced anaphylaxis is the most well‐known SA. However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle. SA can explain some cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis, as well as cases of an apparent breakdown in a previously acquired tolerance for food, or finally, when faced with a suggestive clinical history of food allergy or exercise anaphylaxis and the provocation test is negative. In these situations, a more careful clinical history looking for other cofactors is necessary.",

No obstante, existen algunos vacíos de conocimiento en relación con esta problemática. Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial. Adicionalmente, vivir una experiencia de aprendizaje con este tipo de tensiones puede desencadenar dificultades para la concentración y la memoria, procesos que son fundamentales para el éxito académico.",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education. Although it is a small child it is important to have an holistic interdisciplinary team approach that focuses on the child as a whole and includes all professional disciplines and their existing knowledge in solving problems of the small patient.

      "abstract": "To study the long-term clinical course and outcomes of atypical psychosis, 8 patients diagnosed with atypical psychosis were observed for more than 12 years (mean, 20 years). Retrospective examination was performed, particularly with respect to clinical features at each episode. The overall course of each case was classified as one of the following three types: Type I--\"Recurrent confused state\" type. Patients frequently repeated acute transient confused or dream-like states in a similar way, sometimes and/or for part of the episode accompanied by a floating paranoid-hallucinatory state. Duration of psychotic episode was short, persisting for a few days to about one month. Type II--\"Manic-depressive illness similar\" type. After a long course of disease, the predominantly early middle-aged patients (30- to 40 years-old) demonstrated fewer original characteristic features of acute confused or dream-like states. Instead, manic or depressive episodes tended to predominate. Duration of psychotic episodes exceeded the duration of type I episodes, to a maximum of about 3 months. Type III--\"Appearance of residual state\" type. After several episodes characterized by transient confused state during middle age, residual states consisting of a slight depressive state, reduced spontaneity and flattening of emotions appear. These states become durable and the periodicity of the disease disappeared. We conclude that the core group of atypical psychosis patients presents with confused symptoms as a clinical feature of episodes, and with the recurrent confused state type representing the long-term clinical course. \"Shift to manic-depressive illness similar\" and \"appearance of residual state\" types were considered to be derived from the core group, according to the interplay of personality structure and viable dynamics.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

It commonly involves damage to the peripheral nerves as a result of physical trauma, metabolic diseases such as diabetes, infections such as HIV or shingles, or toxicity induced neuropathies as a result of cancer treatments. Neuropathic pain is common, with epidemiological studies suggesting that around 18–30% of American, European and Australian adults suffer from chronic pain. This leads to significant disabilities and suffering. People with chronic pain complain of spontaneous pains that may be electric-shock like or continuous. Often coexisting with these are abnormal, evoked sensations such as tactile allodynia (pain in response to innocuous stimuli e.g., light brush or pressure) and cold allodynia (pain in response to innocuous cooling), or hyperalgesia (increase pain in response to an already noxious stimulus), as well as ataxia and proprioceptive deficits. The management of these conditions is often suboptimal for two main reasons: firstly, an incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms that are involved (and which of them are the most important). Secondly, patients often have compliance issues with pharmacological medications (Attal, 2012). Both peripheral and central neuronal mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology and since the turn of the century particular emphasis has focussed on the role of glial cells in pain (West et al., 2015). Primary sensory afferents convey information about peripheral stimuli to the central nervous system (CNS). Their cell bodies are located in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and constitute a heterogeneous population that has been classified in several ways. Initially, they were split into the small dark and large light groups based on neurofilament (and myelination) content that correlated well with conduction velocities. With the advent of immunohistochemistry, and the discovery of different trophic factors, these groups were further subdivided into peptide-rich and peptide-poor nociceptors, low threshold mechanoreceptor and proprioceptor subgroups (Scott, 1992). Moreover, it is now known that different DRG neurons can express in > 30 different neurotransmitters or receptors associated with a wide variety of stimuli and that they show considerable phenotypic plasticity associated with peripheral injury (Fukuoka and Noguchi, 2002; West et al., 2015). Most of the attention has focussed on the changes associated with small DRG cells that primarily innervate skin, since these are presumed to be responsible for evoked pain sensations after injury. However, less attention has been paid to the effects of injury on proprioceptors in general, and muscle afferents in particular. This is, in part, due to the paucity of histological markers associated with such fibres. The most commonly used marker of proprioceptive (muscle) afferents is parvalbumin (PV) (Medici and Shortland, 2015). PV is a calcium binding protein that is found in subsets of sensory neurons, inhibitory interneurons and motoneurons. Studies that have explored the effects of nerve injury on muscle afferents reported no changes in its staining patterns after injury. However, those early studies used nerve injury models where injured and non-injured cell bodies coexist within the same DRG. Therefore, plasticity could occur without changing the absolute number of positive cells (downregulation in injured and upregulation in spared neurons). Now there are neuronal markers, such as activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), which can identify damaged afferents and nerve injury models where the injured and non-injured cell bodies are spatially segregated in adjacent spinal ganglia (Shortland et al., 2006). This prompted us to reinvestigate whether or not PV positive cells show phenotypic plasticity (Medici and Shortland, 2015). We first determined that around 25% of L4–5 DRG cells innervating the sciatic nerve express PV. Following axotomy of the sciatic nerve, this number did not significantly change over 1–28 days, confirming earlier studies. Co-expression with the neuronal injury marker ATF3 showed that approximately half the PV cells were axotomised suggesting that both injured and uninjured neurons express PV after sciatic nerve injury. However, around 50–60% of the L4 & L5 DRG neurons contribute axons to the sciatic nerve, so by itself this result did not really answer whether or not phenotypic plasticity was happening, since for switching to occur, one might predict that little or no colocalisation with ATF3 should occur. Therefore, we switched to the spinal nerve ligation model and selectively lesioned the L5 spinal nerve, whilst being careful not to injure the adjacent L4 spinal nerve. In this model, essentially all DRG neurons were injured and expressed ATF3 (Shortland et al., 2006). The percentage of PV staining in the axotomized L5 DRG was unchanged compared to the adjacent L4 DRG, the contralateral L5 DRG and naïve L5 DRG. On the other hand, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) staining, which is an accepted marker of peptidergic nociceptor afferents, including muscle afferents, was completely abolished in the ipsilateral L5 DRG. Thus, these results unequivocally showed that nerve injury did not produce a phenotypic change in PV positive afferents. They also highlighted a clear difference between phenotypic plasticity in proprioceptors versus nociceptors in response to nerve injury. There is now increasing knowledge of the molecular and biochemical repertoire of proprioceptors. Proprioceptors contain several calcium binding proteins such as calcineurin, calretinin and calbindin. They also contain metabolic markers such as carbonic anhydrase and cytochrome oxidase and the enzyme α3Na+/K+ ATPase. Several ion channels are associated with proprioceptors such as Piezo 2, acid sensing ion channel-3 (ASIC3), transient receptor potential V2 (TRPV2), vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and other markers such as the PDZ scaffold protein whirlin. Piezo2, α3Na+/K+ ATPase and whirlin are specific markers for muscle spindles. Following nerve injury, muscle afferents become spontaneously active and can change their neurotransmitter content. They can upregulate galanin, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but many of the markers do not change e.g., TRPV2, ASIC3, carbonic anhydrase, whilst the response to others such as Piezo 2 or whirlin are unknown. A key player in contributing to chronic pain appears to be the de novo expression of BDNF in muscle afferents (Michael et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2010). Recent evidence also implicates changes in the sodium channel Nav1.7 in proprioceptors as an important contributor to chronic pain (Fukuoka et al., 2015), as this is increased in muscle afferents after nerve injury. Yet the afferents retain their normal levels of PV. PV is important for regulating calcium homeostasis in a neuron. After nerve injury, muscle afferents have a reduced and redistributed presynaptic input onto homonymous motoneurons. Before injury, synapses were on the proximal dendrites, whilst after injury they were fewer in number and located further away from the soma. This explained the observations of weak excitatory post synaptic potentials to motoneurons and disappearance of stretch reflexes (Vincent et al., 2015). PV is found in the cell body and peripheral endings, but not in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord (Petitjean et al., 2015), suggesting PV is more important in physiological process such as speed of muscle contraction rather than neurotransmitter release. Nerve injury causes a selective loss of small, but not large-sized, DRG neurons and so PV may have a role in cell survival. Support for this idea comes from studies in motoneuron disease models, where PV is expressed in motoneuron groups that are resistant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and over-expression studies where PV prevents excitotoxic cell death (Medici and Shortland, 2015). Although PV is not present in the central terminals of afferents in the spinal cord, PV staining is clearly present in the dorsal horn. This is associated with the cell bodies and dendrites of a subset of inhibitory interneurons located in lamina IIi-III. Recent pharmacogenetic and selective ablation studies have shown that these PV neurons play a key gate keeping role in mechanical allodynia associated with nerve injury (Petitjean et al., 2015). These neurons receive input from low threshold cutaneous afferents and in turn provide presynaptic inhibition of A-fibres as well as postsynaptic inhibition to PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Nerve injury induces a 50% loss of synaptic appositions between PV interneurons and PKCγ interneurons resulting in disinhibition of pain circuits, without causing any death of PV neurons. Moreover, selective pharmacological blockade of PKCγ neurons attenuated the injury-induced mechanical allodynia (Petitjean et al., 2015). Two other circuits have also been proposed for regulating nociceptive transmission: one involves the inhibition of somatostatin (SOM)-positive excitatory interneurons by dynorphin (Dyn)-positive inhibitory interneurons. The second involves vesicular glutamate transport 3 (vGlut3)-positive excitatory interneurons which regulate activity in PKCγ or calretinin-positive excitatory interneurons (Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Under normal conditions, the vGlut3 interneurons are under powerful inhibitory control but after nerve injury they can drive mechanical allodynia (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015; Gangadharan and Kuner, 2015). Future experiments should determine whether PV interneurons also gate connections with these two neuronal subpopulations. A final layer of complexity is added by the presence of another DRG subpopulation that can cause allodynia after nerve injury. C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (CLTMs) are attributed to conveying sensations of pleasant touch in normal circumstances but produce allodynia after injury (Nagi et al., 2011; Samour et al., 2015). These fibres have a unique molecular repertoire and terminate in lamina IIi of the cord onto central, stalked and vertical cells (Arcourt and Lechner, 2015). Since PV cells have these morphologies (Hughes et al., 2012) they are ideally placed to receive input from such afferents, although this speculation requires confirmation. Taken together, the results of our and other studies suggest that PV is an important protein related to sensory pathways and the plasticity that occurs after injury (Figure 1). We demonstrated that in primary afferents, PV did not change and so can still be used as an anatomical marker of proprioceptors to explore changes in other transmitters, ion channels or transcription factors after peripheral nerve injury. In the CNS, PV may confer preferential survival to excitotoxic insults and importantly gates abnormal sensory information after injury.Figure 1: Overview of the different roles of PV neurons in pain circuits of the spinal cord.PV identifies sensory proprioceptive afferents that make monosynaptic connections with lower motoneurons (MN). After injury, PV levels in DRG neurons remains unchanged but there is a loss of presynaptic terminals from MNs resulting in reduced motor function. In the spinal cord, PV identifies a subset of inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons that gate information from Aβ afferents by presynaptically inhibiting A-fibres and postsynaptically inhibiting PKCγ excitatory interneurons. Additionally, Aβ afferents contact other inhibitory (e.g., Dyn and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)) and excitatory (e.g., SOM) interneurons forming a circuit that regulates nociceptive transmission. Nerve injury alters the synaptic efficacy and results in decreased activation of inhibitory PV cells and increased activation of excitatory neurons (e.g., vGlut3, PKCγ and SOM) and so results in changes in the neuronal circuitry such that innocuous stimuli can now produce behavioural hypersensitivities such as mechanical and cold allodynia.

This leads to a serious decrease in quality of life in patient and their caregivers and it can precipitate the institutionalization. Non-pharmacological therapies are of increasing importance, particularly in therapeutic options. The aim is to gain knowledge about these symptoms, the therapies mentioned above, their utility as well as to identify nursing interventions, through published literature review. In addition to cognitive deterioration other type of symptoms such as apathy, depression, agitation, aggressiveness and anxiety can appear in any stage of illness. Their frequency and intensity tend to increase as the disease progresses. Severe adverse effects associated with some medicines have given rise to non-pharmacological therapies which have been developed in recent years. Moreover, they contribute to some characteristics which are of undoubted interest to, such as no side effects. In addition to this they allow to give individualized treatment. The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) includes interventions that are in accordance with the therapies mentioned within the context of multidisciplinary team working. They are targeted at patient, as well as family members and caregivers.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

All of these factors can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. Negative thoughts, feelings, or emotions may influence lifestyle patterns, increasing the risk of heart disease.

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD. Notable harms exist, including stunted height and possible neurotoxicity.",

      "title": "A Case of Transient Global Amnesia due to Marijuana Use",
      "abstract": "Transient amnesia is a temporary version of the amnestic syndrome. The most striking example of transient amnesia is the transient global amnesia (TGA) syndrome which lasts from several to 24 hours, with or without retrograde components of impairment, and any signs of neurological deficit in nature. In this syndrome, an otherwise cognitively intact individual suddenly loses memory of recent events, asks repetitive questions about his/her environment, and sometimes confabulates (1). TGA is typically described as amnesia of sudden onset regarding events of the present and the recent past (2). It can be caused by central vascular or ischemic lesions. Diagnosis is primarily clinical but includes laboratory tests and radiologic evaluation. TGA typically remits spontaneously, but may recur. There is no specific treatment for amnesia. General stabilization of the patient is indicated (2). Many patients are anxious or agitated and may repeatedly ask questions concerning transpiring events. In the neurologic examination only disturbed memory can be found (3). Upon mental status examination, language function is preserved, which indicates a preservation of semantic and syntax memory. Attention is spared, visual-spatial skills are intact, and social skills are retained. Symptoms typically last less than 24 hours. As the syndrome resolves, the amnesia improves, but the patient may be left with a distinct lapse of recollection for events during the attack. The patient’s behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about his/her immediate circumstances (e.g., “What am I doing here?”; “How did we get here?”) (4). Cannabis is one of the most frequently used substances. Cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids are known to impair several aspects of cognitive function, with the most potent effects on shortterm episodic and working memory in humans (5). Marijuana is used by inhalation in cigars or taken orally. When it is taken by the oral route its effects are seen in a delayed manner, so the inhalation type is used mostly to achieve the desired psychoactive effects (6). After al the cigar was burnt, the peak effects are seen in 20 minutes and disappear in 3 hours. A cigar of marijuana contains 5-20 mg THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Approximately 50% of the THC pass to the alveolar spaces. The most encountered psychotropic side effects of THC are; lethargy, sedation, euphoria, psychological relaxation, euphoria and sometimes, inhibition of the psychological inhibitions as alcohol does, disturbance in the perception of time and location (like feeling of delays in time and elongation of the distances), disturbance in the Abstract Transient global amnesia (TGA) has been a well-described phenomenon for more than 40 years. It presents with a paroxysmal, transient loss of memory. Immediate recall ability and remote memory are preserved. However, patiens experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. In some cases, the degree of retrograde memory loss is mild. Marijuana induced transient global amnesia is a rare side effect. Here, we present a case of memory loss for a short period of time after use of marijuana. (JAEM 2012; 11: 190-2)",

Illicit drug use may be complicated by adverse effects of adulterants, and the intravenous route may act as the means of transmission of viral, bacterial and other communicable diseases.

      "title": "ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SILEXAN IN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY ANXIETY SYNDROMES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Anxiety and depressive diseases represent leading causes of burden worldwide with a globally increasing prevalence and suffering [1]. Although the heterogeneous clinical presentations do not always fully meet the criteria required for a diagnosis of a full-blown psychiatric disease as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), the so-called “subthreshold” or “subsyndromal” severity consistently showed a long-term negative impact on general health, life quality and functionality, and hence a decreased working capability in the affected individuals [2, 3]. For both, subsyndromal as well as full-blown manifestations, beneficial clinical effects on anxious, depressive, psychosomatic and cognitive symptoms and favorable safety profile lacking pharmacological interactions, undesirable sedation, withdrawal symptoms, or abuse potential were repeatedly confirmed for Silexan in patients with primary anxiety syndromes [4, 5]. Additionally, in-vitro studies indicated stimulation of synaptic plasticity, and in rats repeated administration of Silexan decreased immobility time in the forced swimming test [6]. Aims &amp; Objectives Based on the available clinical and preclinical international evidence, the pharmacological profile suggests that Silexan, a proprietary active substance produced from Lavandula angustifolia Miller flowers that has been approved in many countries for the oral treatment of anxiety disorders, may also have an antidepressant effect [6]. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on data from placebo- controlled clinical trials with Silexan at a daily dose of 80 mg [7]. Methods The present meta-analysis investigating comorbid depressive symptoms was conducted based on five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials performed with Silexan in subthreshold anxiety (n = 3) and generalized anxiety disorders (n = 2) [7]. Results The results of the item depressed mood assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale clearly showed that Silexan has a beneficial effect on co-occurring depressive symptoms in these patients [7]. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 315 patients suffering from mixed anxiety and depressive disorder [7]. Silexan was significantly superior to placebo regarding the antidepressant efficacy measured with the Montgomery Å sberg Depression Rating Scale as well as the anxiolytic efficacy measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [7]. Discussion &amp; Conclusion Based on these encouraging results and the need for an antidepressant agent with a beneficial efficacy and tolerability profile lacking unfavorable pharmacological interactions or withdrawal symptoms harming the quality of life, especially in patients with milder forms of depression [4, 7, 8], the antidepressant efficacy of Silexan is currently being investigated in an international randomized placebo-and reference-controlled phase III trial in patients with a mild to moderate major depressive episode (EudraCT Number: 2020-000688-22).

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "title": "Complex Suicides",
      "abstract": "The term \"complex suicide\" refers to suicides in which more than one suicide method is applied. In this context, a distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides. In planned complex suicides, two or more methods are employed simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides, several other methods of suicide are tried after the first method chosen failed to gain one's end or when it proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides, typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g., ingestion of hypnotics or other medicaments, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, jumping from a height) are combined. However, unusual combinations have been described also, such as the simultaneous firing of several guns, self-immolation, jumping from a height, or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides, injuries by sharp force, especially cutting the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases, the suicidal changes from the infliction of cut wounds to the infliction of stab wounds (most often located in the heart region). Other frequently used methods after failure of the first method are hanging and jumping from a height. A further characteristic feature of unplanned complex suicides is the application of more than two methods of suicide. The literature has reported the use of up to five suicide methods applied one after the other. From the criminological point of view, the presence of several injuries of different origin strongly suggests infliction by another person. Differentiation is possible only if autopsy including toxicological analysis is performed and the traces at the death scene are thoroughly investigated, so that the sequel of events can be reconstructed.",

Results: A 44-year-old woman with borderline personality traits and severe drug dependence developed a protracted drug-induced psychosis related to chronic high-dose crystalline methamphetamine use. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred with antipsychotic medication and abstinence from methamphetamine. Rapid recurrence of symptoms occurred at a time of high stress associated with minimal methamphetamine use and cessation of low-dose quetiapine. Symptoms rapidly resolved with abstinence, quetiapine and reduction of stressors. Conclusions: A drug-induced psychosis resembling paranoid schizophrenia can occur with repeated or high-dose use of methamphetamine. While this generally resolves rapidly with cessation of stimulant use, some cases of protracted drug-induced psychosis in vulnerable individuals have been documented. Behavioural sensitization can also occur, and neuroleptics may prevent the recurrence of further psychosis triggered by ongoing low-dose methamphetamine use.",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Functional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2. Vascular algia originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migrain-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias previously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease). 3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, form, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examinations which would only delay treatment and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at length and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychological examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

      "abstract": "This case concerns a 16 days old neonate with massive milk aspiration resulting in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).The syndrome is defined as an unexplained death seen in an apparently healthy baby of less than one year and it usually happens while the baby is sleeping.In past this situation was also recognized as \"aborted crib death\" or \"near miss SIDS\", but in present time these terminologies are not being used.Instead, acute life-threatening event (ALTE) is the terminology used which is defined as \"an episode that is characterized by combination of central or obstructive apnea, colour change (usually cyanosis, but occasionally erythematous or plethoric), marked hypotonia (limpness), choking or gagging\" [1].Although the cause is unknown, it appears that SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep.Besides brain defects, respiratory infection and low birth weight are also the physical factors associated with SIDS.Milk aspiration happens when either food or liquid is inhaled into the lungs.It is commonly observed in babies with weak sucking, choking or chronic coughing while feeding, which often leads to respiratory symptoms.The most common cause is Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), swallowing dysfunction, and neurological dysfunction called cerebral palsy.Aspiration may cause aspiration pneumonia which is an inflammatory condition occur due to irritative gastric contents.",

      "abstract": "Drug abuse is a serious and most often willful misuse of drug now whether it is narcotic or non-narcotic doesn't matter. In our non-narcotic drug too, there are many drugs which lead to addiction. In this pandemic even many people have gone for immunity boosting tablets without knowing its side effect. Non narcotic drug abuse can also be done because of depression, anxiety, mental disorder etc. People actually start taking a lot of medicine for depression but they are not known about the adverse effect of those medicines on their CNS and visceral organs. The present study was conducted to get an idea of drug addiction in people in the society via a survey. Result revealed maximum people opt for taking medicine by their own without consulting doctor were they are maybe known about the work of the drug but unknown about the composition, dosage, how long to continue, etc &amp; there they go for the harmful side effect of those drugs. Even the heavy use of non-narcotic analgesic is paralleled with the high risk of depression, emotional liability, etc. Drug use is dangerous it can harm your brain and body as well. Here, herbal medicine plays a marvellous role in treating the ill without showing any toxic effect. In early stages the signs of medicine developed around those plants which had curative properties. A continued search for medicinal plant during the last several centuries has given rise to a long list of plants which are of great use in the treatment of diseases &amp; promoting health. [1].",

      "abstract": "The abuse of alcohol gives rise to a large number of serious illnesses, an important proportion of which affect the nervous system. The neurological disorders associated with alcoholism are of diverse nature. Clinically it is useful to divide them into three groups: (1) those due to acute intoxication, (2) those due to withdrawal from alcohol, and (3) those due to nutritional deficiency. Certain rare complications of alcoholism, such as degeneration of the cerebellum and the corpus callosum, are not included in this classification, since their relation to the toxic effects of alcohol or to nutritional deficiency has not yet been clarified. Acute intoxication from alcohol results in the familiar symptoms of drunkenness or, if severe in degree, in stupor and coma. In this disorder there appears to be a direct inhibitory effect of alcohol on the nerve cells. The second group comprises the tremulous, hallucinatory, epileptic, and delirious states. This",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury can produce various neuropsychiatric impairments and a high susceptibility to adverse effects of psychotropic medications. A 6-year-old boy developed symptoms of ADHD after head trauma at age 30 months. Three different psychostimulants, three tricyclic antidepressants, clonidine, bupropion, fluoxetine, and propranolol were either ineffective or produced adverse effects. Side effects mainly consisted of organic mood syndrome (despite the lack of apparent genetic or organic mood disorder), sympathomimetic intoxication, and sympathomimetic hallucinosis. Buspirone (10 mg q.i.d.) produced significant improvement in impulsivity and hyperactivity, but not in attention deficits. Methamphetamine (5 mg every morning), added to the buspirone, was effective in treating the remaining attentional symptoms. These treatments were readily tolerated, and the child has remained stable for 2 years on buspirone and methamphetamine. The symptoms of mood disorder were present only during stimulant or antidepressant treatment, and therefore the diagnosis of organic mood disorder did not apply. Apart from medication side effects, the child appeared to have an \"organically-based pharmacological vulnerability to mood disorder\" and postinjury ADHD (although comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions might have contributed to the complex clinical picture). This single case study was uncontrolled, did not involve drug withdrawal design, and used clinical observations rather than standardized measures. Further study is needed before buspirone can be viewed as safe or effective for treating TBI, but buspirone may be an attractive alternative for managing certain behavioral problems following brain injury, especially in patients sensitive to adverse effects of psychotropic medications.",

      "title": "Marihuana \"High\": A Model of Senile Dementia?",
      "abstract": "MARIHUANA \"HIGH\": A MODEL OF SENILE DEMENTIA? ADAM SULKOWSKI* The evidence for marihuana-induced brain atrophy [ 1] and \"amotivational syndrome\" [1,2] has not been convincing so far [3-8]. There are, however, some striking similarities between certain features of acute marihuana intoxication and the clinical syndromes of presenile and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). These similarities become puzzling and thought provoking when one compares the experimental psychological , neurophysiological, neuropathological, and pharmacological studies of these two, apparently so different, phenomena. Psychological studies of acute intoxication with marihuana of mild to moderate potency have shown no effects on sensory acuity and simple reaction time tests [9-11]. Psychogeriatric literature provides no evidence for motor and/or sensory deficits in early stages of Alzheimer's disease [12, 13]. Careful studies of attention, psychomotor speed, memory and learning in our laboratory [11, 14] have not shown marihuanainduced impairment except for the subjects' ability to use effectively already memorized task-relevant information. We called this deficit a failure in information processing. The same finding has been repeatedly described by many authors in the aged and demented populations [15, 16]. Another intriguing similarity is in self-evaluation regarding one's performance. Under the influence of marihuana—and in contrast to alcohol effects—people tend to perceive their performance as much worse than it is in reality (i.e., they overestimate impairment) and as the result they exercise considerable caution and restraint (Sulkowski, unpublished data). As a matter of fact, in real life, marihuana users are said to occasionally endanger safety by driving too slowly. One needs only to observe daily traffic to see how exasperatingly \"cautious\" elderly people can be. This age-related psychological characteristic has been dealt with extensively by psychologists of old age [17-19].»Bedford VA Medical Center GRECC, 200 Springs Road, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730 and Boston University School of Medicine.© 1980 by The University of Chicago. 0031-5982/80/2302-0139$01.00 Perspectives in Biology andMedicine · Winter 1980 \\ 209 A unique and reliable effect ofmarihuana is alteration in time perception which has been seen especially clearly in \"time production\" paradigm (e.g., a subject is asked to signal the limits of a 10-second interval of time) [14, 20, 21]. It has been speculated that the drug alters our internal psychological clock. Identical defects in this hypothetical clock have been described in the elderly and have been considered responsible for decrements on many behavioral tests [22, 23]. Some experts contend that the left (dominant) hemisphere functions are more affected by marihuana than the right (nondominant) hemisphere functions [24, 25]. This reportedly results in disinhibition of the right hemisphere and leads to an altered state of consciousness. Recently published neurological theories postulate that this interhemispheric imbalance is responsible for clinical symptoms of dementia [26]. Rigorous tests of these theories are difficult to design [27] and supportive experimental data are very scant. On the psychosocial (interpersonal) level marihuana produces a quiet detached withdrawal from social environment which might be an analogue of so-called gradual social disengagement typical of very old and demented individuals [28]. It is possible that the failure to actively process information when \"high\" reinforces marihuana use through the mechanism of negative reinforcement by protecting the user from stressful cognitive overload with multiple and contradictory messages typical of modern society. Neurophysiological data from EEG studies of marihuana's acute effects show nonspecific and generalized slowing of alpha rhythm and slight to moderate increase in amplitude [29, 30]. These also happen to be the most common findings in very old subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease [31, 32]. Psychophysiological theorists ofaging have provided some experimental data to support their theory of autonomic nervous system overarousal in the aged and demented [33, 34]. This hyperarousal has been held responsible for interoceptive sensory overload which in turn interfered with CNS adaptive functions. Powerful sympathetic activation is a characteristic and dose-related effect of marihuana. Difficulties with theoretical interpretation notwithstanding, the decrease in cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease has been well documented. Again, there are some preliminary data (L. Miller, personal communication) suggestive of diminished blood supply to the brain in intoxicated marihuana smokers. Pharmacologic studies seem to indicate...",

      "abstract": "To the Editor. Bye has described a patient with a chronic barking cough and has proposed a treatment for what he considers a condition related to stress or anxiety.1 I would like to offer an alternative explanation for this chronic cough. Tics are involuntary actions that may be motor or phonic.2 Phonic tics can be natural sounds done excessively or may include the utterance of partial or whole words. Children whose chronic cough has been considered a tic have previously been described.3,4In the case reported by Bye, the patient also had a facial twitch. Thus, this patient has both a motor and a phonic tic. The natural history of tics is to wax and wane in intensity and to disappear and then reappear in the same or in different forms. The typical age of onset for tics is between 5 and 10 years. As was the case here, phonic tics are often a continuation of what began as a normal phenomenon, eg, continued sniffing or coughing after an upper respiratory infection.In summary, I believe that the patient described by Bye has a tic disorder and will need to be followed to see if other tics occur in the future.In Reply. I would like to thank Dr Erenberg for his insights. I believe we are on the same wavelength. The cough I described is frequently a manifestation of stress or anxiety, such as a tic might be. The nomenclature of this type of cough is imperfect, and there are descriptions of this cough as a “tic cough,” as Dr Erenberg suggests.This young lady continues to receive specialty care from us, and visits her primary care pediatrician regularly. Her asthma has been under good control. She has not had any other manifestations of tics or stress-related phenomena. At Dr Erenberg's suggestion, we will continue to monitor her for this.",

      "abstract": "A 23-year-old male patient, complaining of insomnia for the last two years, has been unresponsive to several trials of sedatives and hypnotics.Moreover, he has experienced multiple fluctuating symptoms of dysphoric mood, isolation, anhedonia, and easy provocation; accordingly, he was prescribed a dosage of escitalopram (20 mg/day per day) and quetiapine (50 mg/day), at night.Later, the symptoms were resolved, except for insomnia.Consequently, other trials of psychotropic medication were received, without any improvement till he presented with delusion of persecution, auditory hallucinations (second person with ordering type), television broadcasting, and depersonalization.At that time, olanzapine 20 md/day, in addition to depakine chrono (500 mg, BID) and risperidone (2 mg/day), were prescribed; but, he showed minimal improvement.This case indicates that a possibility of insomnia, to be the prodromal symptom for psychosis, should be given considerable attention in young patients, with resistant insomnia.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

Disabling chronic breathlessness, persisting despite optimum treatment of the underlying cause [2], is experienced by almost all patients with advanced lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3], and carries a significant emotional, social, health and economic load. Intimately related to physical activity, chronic breathlessness reduces the ability to carry out activities of daily living [4] and restricts the role in the family, workplace or wider society [5]. These consequences, with additional frightening severe episodes of breathless crises, lead not only to acute emotional responses that not only widely activate a multitude of brain regions [6], but also promote the insidious development of depression, anxiety and panic, and a reduction in physical and mental quality of life proportionate with the severity of breathlessness [7].

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

Objectives We present the case of a 22-year-old patient, who has been following up for just over a year. The patient refers that two people inhabit her body, talk to each other, exchange opinions and both have control over the body, one giving the turn to the other depending on the circumstances. To this is added delusional symptoms of grandeur and sensorial-perceptual symptoms. In turn, depressive symptoms have appeared that have led the patient to have several suicide attempts throughout the follow-up time. Methods During this time, the patient has required hospital admission on two occasions due to the autolytic ideation. Treatment with neuroleptics and antidepressants has been established that have helped control delusions and thoughts of death, but not the dissociative clinic. Results Dissociative Identity disorder 300.14 (F44.81) Conclusions The different symptoms presented by the patient, as well as the social and occupational deterioration that he presents, make this an extremely complicated case, both in diagnosis and in treatment. Dissociative identity disorder has been very controversial, changing its diagnostic criteria over time. More studies are needed and perhaps future research can give us more clues about this disorder.

      "title": "NEUROMUSCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF CRITICAL ILLNESS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Neuromuscular weakness is common in the setting of critical illness. Over the past two decades, it has been recognized that polyneuropathy or myopathy may develop de novo as a complication of the underlying illness, sepsis, or the medical therapies. This weakness complicates recovery and often contributes to prolonged ventilator dependence. REVIEW SUMMARY The neuromuscular complications of critical illness include critical illness polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, and prolonged pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. As a complication of critical illness and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (usually produced by sepsis), an axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy may be seen. A myopathy, often called acute quadriplegic myopathy, may develop in a similar setting, often in association with the use of corticosteroids and/or nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents (NMBAs). Weakness in this latter disorder may result from electrical inexcitability of muscle due to altered membrane sodium channels with reduced sodium currents and loss of myosin thick filament. Some patients, particularly those with abnormal renal or hepatic function, may have prolonged weakness for as long as one week after the use of NMBAs. This large, heterogeneous group of patients are difficult to evaluate due to the limitations imposed by the critical care setting and may have critical illness polyneuropathy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, or both. CONCLUSIONS Neuromuscular weakness may occur in association with a combination of risk factors, including sepsis and multiorgan failure (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), high-dose corticosteroids, and NMBAs. This may take the form of an axonal polyneuropathy, an acute myopathy, or both.",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular.

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "title": "Steps Following Attainment of Remission",
      "abstract": "Article Abstract Depressive disorders require long-term treatment with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or both. The goal of antidepressant therapy is complete remission of symptoms and return to normal daily functioning. Studies have shown that achieving remission and continuing antidepressant therapy long after the acute symptoms remit can protect against the relapse or recurrence of the psychiatric episode. Many patients, however, inadvertently or intentionally skip doses of their antidepressant, and even discontinue it, if their symptoms improve or if they experience side effects. Antidepressant discontinuation may increase the risk of relapse or precipitate certain distressing symptoms such as gastrointestinal complaints, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, equilibrium disturbances, and sleep disorders. Documented with all classes of antidepressants, these reactions may emerge within a couple of days, or even hours, after the abrupt discontinuation of an antidepressant with a short half-life. These distressing responses may be mistaken for a relapse or recurrence. It is important to recognize the potential for these sequelae and educate patients about the need to take all antidepressants at the doses prescribed, warning them of the symptoms that may occur if they skip doses or stop their medication too quickly. Antidepressants should be tapered slowly over a period of days, weeks, or even months, depending on the dose, duration of treatment, and pharmacologic properties of the agent, as well as the patient's individual response. This article reviews the risks and reactions associated with discontinuation of antidepressants. It offers guidelines for distinguishing relapse and recurrence from discontinuation responses as well as for prevention and management of the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "In a previous publication (Brown and Birley, 1968) we have presented some findings which suggest that life changes and crises frequently precipitate the acute onset, relapse or exacerbation of schizophrenic states. To summarize : consecutively admitted patients diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia were seen at mental hospitals serving a known catchment area. The first fifty whose onsets occurred within three months of admission and could be accurately dated within a week were included. Both the patient and at least one other informant were interviewed about the occurrence of certain previously defined and datable events occurring to the patient or to close relatives. These included such events as moving house, starting or leaving a job, admission to hospital, birth, marriage or death during the twelve weeks prior to onset. These were classified, according to their apparent independence of the patient's control, as ‘independent’ or ‘possibly independent’. The former were those which could be regarded as outside his control, e.g. discovering a burglary or hearing of a brother's serious illness. ‘Possibly independent’ events were those which were considered to have been within the patient's control but which had not been brought about by any unusual behaviour on the patient's part. They were chiefly changes of job, or of opposite sex friends. (Loss of job would, under certain circumstances, be rated as ‘independent’, e.g. when a whole firm closed down).",

In this article I draw on personal experience to suggest ways to tackle some challenges that commonly arise after diagnosing dissociative seizures, focusing on three issues: \"I want to know what is wrong with me,\" \"I hear what you are saying but it doesn't apply to me\" and \"What if I have a seizure?\" The suggestions detail both actions and words that may help at a crucial point in the patient's journey. If handled well, the process can leave the patient better equipped to understand their seizures and to engage in further treatment; if handled badly, patients may be left more traumatised, angry and with additional disability.",

It is a typical asthmatic attack following physical exercise, lasting 5-10 min, most often in cold and dry weather. The prevalence in asthmatic children is high, in adolescents not yet firmly established. Cold air and/or hypertonic bronchial challenges during exercise are discussed as pathophysiological mechanisms. Nonpharmacological and drug treatment of EIA must preferentially be preventive. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (urticaria, pruritus, edema) occurs mainly in children, triggered by exercise alone or by the combination of sensitizing food and exercise. Antihistamines before exercise are recommended. The use of sport equipment can induce contact dermatitis in rare cases.",

When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

The patient experienced acute dystonic reactions on three separate occasions when he forgot to take his methylphenidate medication. The present report informs clinicians about the possible side effects, such as dystonia, when psychostimulant and antipsychotic drug combinations are altered and suggests that the abrupt cessation of stimulants may lead to the development of movement disorders.

To date, most studies of post-stroke depression have excluded patients who have suffered a minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), although they are equally vulnerable subgroups of this sickness.We present a review of published studies of post-stroke depression to elucidate aspects that have already been widely demonstrated and those who need more evidence.The post-stroke depression is both frequent in patients with established stroke and minor stroke or TIA.

We have identified risk factors of post-stroke depression with a broad scientific background (female, history of depression or other psychiatric disorders, stroke severity, functional impairment) and other without it (quality of life, cognitive impairment and neuroimaging biomarkers). The main methodological limitations found are: confusion between post-stroke depression and depressive symptoms; variability in rating scales used; and temporal variability in the time of the evaluation of mood. To date very few studies focused on minor stroke or TIA.Further studies are required with improved design in order to help establish the risk of post-stroke depression at different times after the stroke, minor stroke or TIA and the importance of all the factors described above.Actualizacion de la depresion postictus: nuevos retos en pacientes con ictus minor o ataque isquemico transitorio.Introduccion.

      "abstract": "Soldiers with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) present with an array of neuropsychiatric symptoms that can be grouped into nosological clusters: (1) cognitive dysfunctions: difficulties in memory, attention, language, visuospatial cognition, sensory-motor integration, affect recognition, and/or executive function typically associated with neocortical damage; (2) neurobehavioral disorders: mood, affect, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and psychosis, as well as agitation, sleep problems, and libido loss, that may have been caused by damage to the cortex, limbic system, and/or brain stem monoaminergic projection systems; (3) somatosensory disruptions: impaired smell, vision, hearing, equilibrium, taste, and somatosensory perception frequently caused by trauma to the sensory organs or their projections through the brain stem to central processing systems; (4) somatic symptoms: headache and chronic pain; and (5) substance dependence. TBI-related cognitive impairment is common in veterans who have served in recent conflicts in the Middle East and is often related to blasts from improvised explosive devices. Although neurobehavioral disorders such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder commonly occur after combat, the presentation of such disorders in those with head injury may pass undetected with use of current diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological instruments. With a multidimensional approach (such as the biopsychosocial model) applied to each symptom cluster, psychological, occupational, and social dysfunction can be delineated and managed.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Managing drug-induced psychosis",
      "abstract": "AbstractSubstance-induced psychosis is a secondary psychotic disorder resulting from drug abuse, characterized by one or more psychotic episodes. Drug-induced psychosis is expected to resolve after a 30-day period of sobriety, however, individuals with this condition are more likely to develop severe drug addiction. Compared to primary psychosis, participants with drug-induced psychosis exhibit poorer family history of psychotic diseases, higher insight, fewer positive and negative symptoms, more depressive symptoms, and greater anxiety. Substance-induced psychosis is strongly associated with the emergence of bipolar illness or schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with an increased chance of developing schizophrenia at a younger age. Episodes of self-harm after substance-induced psychosis are strongly linked to an elevated likelihood of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effective treatment involves ruling out emergencies, investigating underlying causes, and addressing acute intoxication and withdrawal. Management includes dynamic assessment, intervention, and vigilant monitoring in cases of suicidal behaviour. Antipsychotics may be used for short term, with gradual discontinuation when a person is in a stable condition. Relapse prevention strategies, both medication and non-medication-based, are crucial in long-term management. Conversion rates to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder can be as high as one in three individuals, with cannabis users and those with early-onset substance abuse at the highest risk.Keywords: Drug-induced psychosispsychotic disordersbipolar disorderschizophreniarisk Authors' contributionAll authors participated in all stages of the review.Disclosure statementLB worked as a scientific consultant for Libbs and Jansen.

Simultaneous administration of clonazepam or dipropylacetate (the latter in a short term combination) with diphenylhydantoin can cause a significant increase of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations and intoxications. The combination of carbamazepin with diphenylhydantoin can cause a decrease of diphenylhydantoin serum concentrations. The simultaneous administration of diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital can produce a significant increase of phenobarbital levels in the statistical average and in the case of a combination of primidon and diphenylhydantoin an intoxication by the primidon metabolite phenobarbital. These possible interactions which are not obvious at the beginning of therapy are supplemented by other factors as intercurrent diseases or erratic drug intake. With routine measurements of serum concentrations of anticonvulsive drugs some of these interfering factors can be eliminated by realizing them in time. Treatment becomes more effective and side effects are reduced. The development of a new check list for the treatment of epileptic patients should also improve the control and give better informations about the course of the disease.",

A key question is whether this has long term consequences. Cognitive problems are commonly reported in patients 3 months after acute infection as part of the so called Long-Covid syndrome. However, the underlying cause is not well understood. Candidate explanations include legacy from encephalitis and stroke; however, other complications such as the sequelae, delirium, remain underexplored. Furthermore, little consideration has been given to functional cognitive disorders and the cognitive consequences of depression, anxiety and fatigue. <h3>Aims</h3> We propose a structured approach to clinical assessment for clinicians reviewing late cognitive complaints after COVID 19. <h3>Methods</h3> We created our own unique framework for neurocognitive Covid assessment based upon a review of the literature. <h3>Results</h3> Covid status- Any positive test. If not review of core symptoms such as breathlessness, headache, anosmia, nasal obstruction, cough, myalgia, or gustatory dysfunction; duration, extent of exposure to Covid confirmed cases. Consider rapid antibody testing. Neuropsychiatric history- Part 1 symptoms at onset- in particular disruptions of consciousness and altered mental state. Acute memory impairment, anterograde/retrograde and with/without a temporal gradient. neurocognitive function. ITU admission and oxygen requirements. Part 2 Current cognitive and mental state- in addition to standard history seek evidence of internal inconsistency of memory symptoms and attentional dysregulation. Has social cognition and meta-cognition been affected. Note attribution bias i.e. no Im not depressed, I cant enjoy anything because of my symptoms Background history- subtle suggestion of neurodegeneration and depression, anxiety and functional symptoms should be explored. MRI findings- signal changes in the medial temporal lobe, nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions, and isolated white matter microhemorrhages. Novel biomarkers IL-6, MCP-1, and IP-10. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Cognitive symptoms are common after confirmed and assumed COVID exposure.

Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease. Finally major depression, but especially minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms merge with other manifestations of human distress with which patients present to their doctors, Such somatic presentations test the conventional distinction between physical and mental disorder, and are a perennial source of controversy.",

Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

The aim of the work is to systematize and analyze the data about drugs that can cause the development of drug-induced hypertension, as well as on epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, clinical picture, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment and prevention of drug-induced hypertension. As a result of data analysis, it was revealed that drugs: glucocorticosteroids, antineoplastic drugs, immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, antidepressants and some others are associated with the development of hypertension. The mechanisms of development of drug-induced arterial hypertension are not fully established and require further study. Drug-induced arterial hypertension is still one of the most common and often unrecognized adverse reactions. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypertension are not speciﬁc. The symptoms are associated with target organ damage or complications of hypertension and may include a headache, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, anxiety, shortness of breath, etc. patients with previously well-controlled hypertension or cases of uncontrolled hypertension. Therefore, it is always necessary to pay attention to the patient’s history, pharmacological anamnesis, rapid increases in blood pressure in patients with previously well-controlled hypertension, or cases of uncontrolled hypertension.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью.

      "abstract": "Todd's paralysis, a neurological abnormality characterized by temporary limb weakness or hemiplegia, typically occurs following a seizure, without enduring consequences. Since limb weakness or hemiplegia can also be a common symptom of an acute ischemic stroke, it is often difficult to diagnose Todd's paralysis in individuals experiencing an acute ischemic stroke if they do not have a pre-existing history of epilepsy. Given that there is a limited understanding of Todd's paralysis, this review discusses the history, prevalence, clinical manifestations, duration, etiology, and diagnosis of Todd's paralysis. A few factors that may help clinicians distinguish Todd's paralysis from other clinical indications are as follows: (1) Todd's paralysis is commonly observed after partial seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. (2) The incidence of Todd's paralysis is greater if the epilepsy is associated with old age or stroke history. (3) The duration of Todd's paralysis can range from minutes to days, depending on the type of seizure or whether the patient has experienced cortical structural damage. (4) The etiology of Todd's paralysis is associated with cerebral perfusion abnormality after seizures. Further research is needed to explore factors that distinguish Todd's paralysis from other indications that may lead to limb weakness in order to improve the diagnosis of Todd's paralysis.",

      "abstract": "Because illicit drugs are now widely consumed, every doctor needs to know their acute medical consequences and complications. Here, we review the problems associated with the different drugs from a systems-based viewpoint. Apart from the respiratory depressant effect of opioids, crack cocaine is the most common cause of respiratory complications, mainly linked with its mode of use, with airway burns, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and lung syndromes being well-recognised sequelae. Because of its marked cardiovascular effects, cocaine is also a major cause of coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction. Amphetamines may produce similar effects less commonly. Hyperthermia may occur with cocaine toxicity or with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) due to exertion or from serotonin syndrome. Cerebral haemorrhage may result from the use of amphetamines or cocaine. Hallucinations may follow consumption of LSD, amphetamines, or cocaine. MDMA is a major cause of acute severe hyponatraemia and also has been linked with hepatic syndromes. Collapse, convulsions, or coma may be caused in different circumstances by opioids, MDMA, or gamma hydroxybutyrate and may be aggravated by other sedatives, especially alcohol and benzodiazepines. Recognition of these acute complications is urgent, and treatment must be based on an understanding of the likely underlying problem as well as on basic principles of supportive care.",

      "title": "Post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome",
      "abstract": "Central anticholinergic syndrome is defined as an absolute or relative reduction in cholinergic activity in the central nervous system [1]. In anaesthetic practice the syndrome was originally described in connection with drugs with central anticholinergic actions, such as hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) [2]. Later, many other drugs with no direct anticholinergic effects were implicated. This may be by modulation of other neurotransmitters which reduce cholinergic activity, but the mechanisms by which the syndrome occurs have not been fully explained [1]. The reported clinical features of the central anticholinergic syndrome in the post-operative period are non-specific. If they are all components of the syndrome the central nervous system would be widely involved (Table 1). There are said to be two forms of the syndrome: hyperactive or depressed. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms may also occur but could by masked by peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors. Diagnosis rests on clinical features, exclusion of other conditions, and a positive response to a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually physostigmine [1].Table 1: Reported clinical features of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome The incidence of the post-operative syndrome has been estimated as 9.4% after general anaesthesia and 3.3% after regional anaesthesia with sedation [1], although an incidence as high as 40% has been claimed [5]. In their paper in this issue of the journal [6], Link et al. report an incidence of 1.9% in a broad mix of 962 adults after general anaesthesia, with a subgroup of women recovering from major gynaecological surgery having an incidence of 10%. These figures are in stark contrast with experience in the UK where central anticholinergic syndrome is diagnosed rarely. United Kingdom anaesthetists are either unaware of the syndrome, or do not believe it exists. Choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs may be an important determinant of reported incidence. Anaesthetists who use long acting drugs (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) will see a large number of patients who recover slowly from anaesthesia. Link et al. state that less than 3% of their study population were given droperidol as part of their anaesthetic, but eight of 18 patients with the syndrome received between 2.5 and 25 mg. The total number of patients given diazepam and phenobarbitone premedication is not stated, but nine of 18 affected patients received one of these drugs. What constitutes normal recovery from anaesthesia and a definition of what is abnormally prolonged are not stated. Clearly, the earlier that features of the syndrome are sought the higher will be their incidence in the post-operative period. Interindividual variations in anaesthetic drugs and technique, as well as variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, must also be taken into account. From the clinical features it is obvious that the list of differential diagnoses is long. As there is no diagnostic test, the diagnosis is made by exclusion of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, urea and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and neurological disturbance from surgery, vascular disease or trauma [1]. The extensive list of symptoms and signs means that central anticholinergic syndrome is a potential diagnosis in patients with just about any form of neurological abnormality, and that the incidence could be inversely proportional to the rigour with which other diagnoses are excluded. In some settings, rigorous exclusion of all other conditions may be simply impossible in the immediate post-operative period. The diagnosis, therefore, is heavily dependent on a response to physostigmine, whose central effects extend beyond the cholinergic system [7,8]. Perhaps central anticholinergic syndrome is a misnomer, and central physostigmine responsive syndrome is a more accurate description. This does not mean that post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome should be dismissed out of hand. The case report by Sun [9] cannot easily be explained by any other diagnosis. This is a report of three general anaesthetics in one patient, who took 14 and 10 h to regain full consciousness after repair of retinal detachment under general anaesthesia that included reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine and atropine. On the third occasion, an identical anaesthetic to the second was given but without reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This time the patient was fully conscious 10 min after the end of the anaesthesia. Physostigmine was not available in the hospital involved. Physostigmine shortens wakening times after general anaesthesia [10]. However, its duration of action is about 30–60 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection [11] and, in common with other 'antidotes' such as naloxone and flumazenil, there is a danger of later recurrence of symptoms. Reported side effects of physostigmine in this setting include nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps [10,12,13] and bradycardia and hypotension [13]. It would therefore seem appropriate to avoid treating one drug's side effects with another drug that exposes patients to other risks. We should accept that some patients recover from anaesthesia more slowly than others, and perhaps the safest course of action is to observe and support them during this time. Careful choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs tailored to individual circumstances should reduce the need for prolonged support. Until a more rigid definition is available, preferably supported by a controlled trial, differences in the reported incidence of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome seem likely to continue.

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ?

      "abstract": "Electric current can damage an individual by thermal heating of the tissues; by disregulating autonomously functioning organ systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems; or by once-only or continuing stimulation of the nerves and striated muscles. In the first case, the result is coagulation necrosis, and in the second case life-threatening events can occur, such as arrhythmia or apnea. In the third case, vigorous nerve stimulation can lead to paralysis and vasospasm. Massive muscle contractions due to nerve stimulation or the direct triggering of striated muscles can cause ruptures, ligamentous tears, fractures, and joint dislocations, while prolonged current passing through the thoracic wall may stimulate tetany of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm resulting in asphyxia. This article is confined to a description of thermal or Joule heating of tissues when they form part of an electric circuit and to the effects of direct nerve and muscle stimulation. Other articles discuss nonthermal effects. The injuries a person sustains as the result of an electrical accident depend on a large number of interrelated factors, such as the properties of the electrical power supply, the magnitude and duration of current flow, the current pathway, and skin conditions. It makes a vast difference whether a person is hit by a lightning bolt (extremely high voltage, short current flow) or receives a shock from an electrical power supply (low to high voltage, relatively long current flow). Wide variation in the physical properties of lightning discharges and the discharges from electrical power supplies at home and in industry means that all kinds of injuries can be encountered.",

[2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

      "title": "Episodic Ataxia Type 1",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA1) is a potassium channelopathy characterized by constant myokymia and dramatic episodes of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles of the head, arms, and legs with loss of both motor coordination and balance. During attacks individuals may experience a number of variable symptoms including vertigo, blurred vision, diplopia, nausea, headache, diaphoresis, clumsiness, stiffening of the body, dysarthric speech, and difficulty in breathing, among others. EA1 may be associated with epilepsy. Other possible associations include delayed motor development, cognitive disability, choreoathetosis, and carpal spasm. Usually, onset is in childhood or early adolescence. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, an electrophysiologic test of axonal superexcitability and threshold electrotonus, and/or the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in KCNA1 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Acetazolamide, a carbonic-anhydrase inhibitor, may reduce the frequency and severity of attacks in some but not all affected individuals. Antiepileptic drugs may significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in some individuals. Supportive therapies, such as physical therapy, may reduce the risk of later-onset orthopedic complications. Routine treatment of seizure disorders, scoliosis, and developmental disabilities. Prevention of primary manifestations: In addition to pharmacologic treatments, behavioral measures including avoidance of stress, abrupt movements, loud noises, and caffeine may be used to reduce disease manifestations in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Prevention of secondary complications: Joint contractures can be prevented by appropriate physiotherapy. Surveillance: Annual neurologic examination. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Triggers of attacks, including physical exertion, emotional stress, and changes in environmental temperature; marked generalized myokymia has been reported during induction of anesthesia. Pregnancy management: Affected women should be made aware that pregnancy may trigger attacks; possible loss of balance and falls could endanger the fetus. Several stressors that trigger attacks may cause breathing difficulties; thus, delivery by C-section should be considered. Genetic counseling EA1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with EA1 have an affected parent; however, de novo pathogenic variants have been reported. Each child of an individual with EA1 has a 50% chance of inheriting the KCNA1 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member.",

      "abstract": "Trauma is like an emotional shockan experience that is too overwhelming to process during or immediately after the traumatic event or situation.Normally, with support and over time the person naturally recovers from the trauma and can integrate their traumatic experience as part of their personal history.The trauma becomes a memory that can be thought of and described.When someone is traumatized as in PTSD, instead of a conscious memory the trauma continues to exist in the present as physical sensations, such as fear, panic, and rage.The person may not be able to connect these feelings to anything that has happened.Such disturbing sensations and feelings become a threat in themselves, so all aspects of everyday life are organised to avoid situations that may trigger them.Trauma during the early years can be particularly damaging because the child's brain is not fully developed.Therefore, the natural development process can also be disrupted and distorted.Trauma alters patterns in the brain.Chemicals such as adrenaline and cortisone are produced in excess, initially as a necessary survival response, i.e. to prepare a person's body to take flight from the threat.Trauma that is repeated over time, often in many different forms, such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse, as well as neglectbecomes what is known as complex trauma.This can have a profound effect on a child's psychological, biological and social functioning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The withdrawal syndromes after discontinuance of alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other sedative drugs, such as chloral and paraldehyde, are all similar. The severity of a withdrawal reaction is largely determined by the daily dose, the duration of administration and the rate of fall of the drug levels after withdrawal, as well as the propensity of the individual patient. The time course of a withdrawal reaction is determined by the drug's clearance. Alcohol has a half‐life of a few hours; withdrawal symptoms may develop within 6–8 hours of abstinence and convulsions in 12–48 hours. After discontinuance of short‐ or medium‐acting barbiturates (half‐life 8–40 hours) symptoms may develop in 1–3 days, followed by convulsions and delirium after 3–8 days. Symptoms and seizures may develop in the 1–10 days after withdrawal of benezodiazepines. In patients with no prior history of epilepsy the types of seizures most commonly induced by drug withdrawal are generalized convulsions, but partial seizures are not uncommon if there is a focal cerebral lesion, or a previous history of partial seizures. Paroxysmal activity and photosensitivity may occur after barbiturate withdrawal in non‐epileptics, more commonly in severe withdrawal reactions. Similar EEG changes may be seen after alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, but photosensitivity does not appear to have been shown to be a feature of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

In my hands and in the hands of my associates, it has given results which are nothing short of marvelous. I consider X-ray therapy the treatment of choice. When considering the treatment of such a broad and ill-defined class of patients one may easily be misunderstood, unless some definition or description of the cases is given. The cases which we class as suitable for this treatment must have a rapid pulse when resting and a definite increased basal metabolic rate of plus 12 or more, associated with some of. the other symptoms such as fine tremor not limited to the fingers, tachycardia, profuse perspiration as shown by warm, moist palms, and some marked nervous manifestations, as frequent winking, change of disposition or unusual energy without continuity of purpose. In a marked vagotonic case the pulse may be as low as 80, but this is unusual. Such cases must have other definite symptoms such as a marked increased basal metabolic rate or a definite von Graefe's sign, lacrimation, palpitation, severe sweating or diarrhea. The typical exophthalmic cases with en1arged thyroid gland are easily recognized, and are included. These usually respond quickly. The mild adenomata of adolescence are never included; they do not require treatment other than general medical care and time. If they become severe they are easily handled. No case has come to us too advanced to be included. I shall not trouble you with statistics, but shall try to convince you of the value of X-ray irradiation by affirming that the cases have not been selected except as I have stated. We have taken them all as they came. The results have been almost universally good. Until a few years since I was able to say that my results seemed to be 100 per cent successful. Since then we have had two deaths and one case which I believe was scared into an operation by a surgeon. These cases are briefly recorded below. Some cases have ceased treatment against advice. A few cases have returned for treatment because of some unusual emotion, such as that caused by death in the family or fright. Such cases are easily handled. These represent the only cases which have recurred. The number of our cases that could in any way be considered failures or have re-lapsed ever so slightly, is so small as to be almost negligible compared to the great number returned to full health, full weight, full earning power and full enjoyment of life. Nothing is more gratifying than to cure one of these patients, who has not only been miserable but who has turned a whole happy home into misery. The degree to which these patients may be cured is dependent only upon the amount of permanent damage which has been done to the heart, and upon other coincident diseases.",

      "title": "A new molecular risk pathway for postpartum mood disorders: clues from steroid sulfatase–deficient individuals",
      "abstract": "Abstract Postpartum mood disorders develop shortly after childbirth in a significant proportion of women. These conditions are associated with a range of symptoms including abnormally high or low mood, irritability, cognitive disorganisation, disrupted sleep, hallucinations/delusions, and occasionally suicidal or infanticidal ideation; if not treated promptly, they can substantially impact upon the mother’s health, mother-infant bonding, and family dynamics. The biological precipitants of such disorders remain unclear, although large changes in maternal immune and hormonal physiology following childbirth are likely to play a role. Pharmacological therapies for postpartum mood disorders can be effective, but may be associated with side effects, concerns relating to breastfeeding, and teratogenicity risks when used prophylactically. Furthermore, most of the drugs that are used to treat postpartum mood disorders are the same ones that are used to treat mood episodes during non-postpartum periods. A better understanding of the biological factors predisposing to postpartum mood disorders would allow for rational drug development, and the identification of predictive biomarkers to ensure that ‘at risk’ mothers receive earlier and more effective clinical management. We describe new findings relating to the role of the enzyme steroid sulfatase in maternal postpartum behavioural processes, and discuss how these point to a novel molecular risk pathway underlying postpartum mood disorders. Specifically, we suggest that aberrant steroid hormone–dependent regulation of neuronal calcium influx via extracellular matrix proteins and membrane receptors involved in responding to the cell’s microenvironment might be important. Testing of this hypothesis might identify novel therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers.",

      "title": "Renal dysfunction in fetal alcohol syndrome: a potential contributor on developmental disabilities of offspring.",
      "abstract": "The term fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) signifies the triad of intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly and short palpebral fissures, due to prenatal exposure to alcohol (1-4). Those severely affected have unusual facial dysmorphism with microcephaly, narrow forehead, short palpebral fissures with hypoplastic upper lip (5-7). In addition, they have developmental delay, behavior dysfunction or deficit, intellectual impairment and/or mental retardation (8,9). The term fetal alcohol effects (FAE) describe less extreme changes associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Criteria have not yet been established for the diagnosis of FAE, but there is consensus that the diagnosis requires deficiencies in two of the above categories and a history of maternal alcohol abuse (1-4). \r\n\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure has also been linked to cardiac anomalies, urinary and kidney anomalies, neural tube defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, gastrointestinal and genital abnormalities, dental anomalies, limb and joint abnormalities, scoliosis, ptosis, strabismus, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, myopia, short up-turned nose, broad or low nasal bridge, low set ears and rotated ears (10-12). \r\n\r\nRenal structural anomalies of FAS include cross-fused ectopia, renal hypoplasia and urethropelvic junction obstruction have been reported in children with FAS (10,12). More recent clinical and experimental studies have also shown that fetuses exposed to ethanol perinatally have a number of renal functional abnormalities, including impairment in renal acidification and potassium excretion as well as a defect in urinary concentrating ability, even in the absence of any structural abnormalities (13-15). The scanning electron microscopy examinations of the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol, showed mitochondrial swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron, suggesting the possibility of alcohol induced renal tubular cell injury (16). Assadi and Ziai also reported that offspring of alcoholic mothers particularly those children with FAS have lower plasma zinc levels and that the urinary excretion of zinc is increased in these infants, suggesting a direct relationship between urinary losses and lower plasma zinc levels (17). \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 5% of all congenital birth defects are attributable to prenatal alcohol exposure across the globe (18-20). Estimates for the incidence of full-blown FAS, is 8 for every 1,000 live births, while that for FAE range from 10-30 per 1,000 live births (18-20). It is estimated that 110,000 newborns annually are affected by alcohol. Cost estimates for FAS/FAE are exorbitant. It is also estimated that 12% of the annual cost for all institutional care for the mentally retarded patients, in the Western communities, are for individuals with FAS/FAE (21). \r\n\r\nDespite the wide spread incidence, FAS remains to be difficult to diagnose clinically, and difficult to research. The clinical features may not be readily obvious and individually are not specific to only FAS (6,9,22). The neonatal period is the most difficult to diagnose FAS. In the neonate the facial dysmorphic feature is subtle, often obscured by periorbital or general facial edema. Mental retardation and developmental impairment may not be evident for several years. Throughout gross specific clinical features can vary. No single feature is found in every case. Also, there exists some overlap between FAS and other syndromes. A history of alcohol abuse in pregnancy is often under reported or denied. Physicians tend to under diagnose FAS either due to lack of familiarity with the syndrome or a reluctance to place a label with negative social connotations. \r\n\r\nThe most distressing consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure is the central nervous system damage (7,8). The affected newborn may exhibit poor sucking, tremulousness, unusual body posturing, abnormal reflexes, and disturbed sleep patterns. The older infant demonstrates measurable decrements in mental and motor development, poor visual recognition, memory and decreased expressive and receptive language. Affected preschoolers demonstrate decreased IQ scores, attention deficits, delayed reaction time and decrements in fine and gross motor performance. The school aged child has decreased achievement scores, is easily distracted, learning disabled, shows poor organization and cooperation and has a rigid approach to problem-solving (7,8). Adolescents and adults with FAS have an average IQ of 65 with a range from 20 to 90. Those with FAE have an average IQ of 80, ranging from 40 to 100 (1-6). Despite higher IQ scores, individuals with FAE generally have achievement test scores similar to those with full FAS. In general, more physical manifestations are associated with poorer intelligence. However, there is a wide overlap in the ranges and the degree of brain damage is not always directly proportional to the severity of physical malformations, making it difficult to predict intelligence on an individual basis. Adolescents and adults exhibit a wide variety of behavioral problems, including impulsivity, social withdrawal and anxiety. Most have problems in adaptive living, lacking judgment and problem-solving skills. Few adults with FAS or FAE are self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nThe identification of renal dysfunction and zinc deficiency in FAS is important from a prognostic point of view and to permit adequate and comprehensive management of patients with this syndrome. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that birth defects that result from prenatal zinc deficiency are likely caused by a defect in DNA and protein synthesis (23-25). It is also known that zinc deficiency can lower the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in multiple organs of alcoholic patients (26). \r\n\r\nBecause zinc plays an important role in DNA synthesis and current data are inconclusive, it is possible that alcohol-induced zinc deficiency may contribute to alcohol related birth defects observed in FAS (17). This possibility remains a reasonable hypothesis and requires further study. \r\n\r\nAlcohol induced organ damage arises not only from the direct effects of alcohol on tissues but also from the metabolism and the metabolites of alcohol. Recent investigations have focused on assessing the direct effect of alcohol versus acetaldehyde toxicity, the role of nutrition with impaired placental function and synergic effects of nicotine and caffeine (26). More specifically, mechanisms for FAS involving altered protein synthesis and hypoxemia have been considered (26). Class I and Class II alcohol dehydrogenases are the enzymes that are primarily responsible for initial degradation of alcohol, acetaldehyde, in humans. It has been found that acetaldehyde can cross the human placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartments. Toxic aldehydes generated in this initial degradation step are further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases. It seems likely that genetic variation in alcohol metabolism may lead to differences in the propensity of individuals to develop alcohol induced organ damage. With DNA probes, it will now be possible to assess the role of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the development of organ damage. \r\n\r\nAs to a specific mechanism by which alcohol may impair fetal growth and development, impaired protein synthesis, abnormal delivery or regulation of glucose in the fetus, altered zinc metabolism, and hypoxia are key considerations under investigation. Better understanding of the mechanism involved may permit more meaningful therapeutic intervention. \r\n\r\nThe timing of alcoholic exposure is also crucial (22). The most crucial period for anatomic abnormalities is early in the first trimester, which includes the time segment preceding pregnancy recognition. The third trimester appears to be the most vulnerable period for overall gross and central nervous system development. Intrauterine growth retardation cannot be detected by ultrasonography until approximately 27 weeks gestation. \r\n\r\nFAS/FAE is particularly tragic because it is totally preventable, simply through abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. It is the responsibility of health care professionals, social and government agencies to protect the unborn child from the devastating effects of alcohol. The most effective weapon for prevention of FAS is education which targets every non-pregnant of childbearing age (27,28). Pregnant women who are identified to use alcohol should be intensively counseled to discontinue further alcohol consumption. Although this will not reverse any damage already produced, at least any further damage is prevented. \r\n\r\nIdentification of women at risk is often difficult. Simple questioning can be unreliable because of poor recall or denial. Since direct questioning regarding alcohol can be intimidating, questionnaires may be developed for assessment of risk. Hopefully through continued educational efforts, we will successfully imprint the awareness that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is unacceptable.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric symptoms can be associated with several systemic and central nervous system infections and they can be the initial presenting symptoms, occurring in the absence of neurological symptoms in some disorders as in some cases of viral encephalitis. They could also be part of the clinical picture in other cases such as psychosis or mood symptoms secondary to brucellosis or toxoplasmosis. Late-onset neuropsychiatric complications may also occur several years following the infection such as in the case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to measles. Some Infectious diseases may have possible etiological role for major psychiatric disorders, based on yet unconfirmed reports for viral infectious diseases (e.g. Influenza virus and HSV-1) which are thought to have risk for developing schizophrenia and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects can occur due to drugs (e.g. mefloquine, interferon-alpha) that are used for treatment of infectious diseases. Psychiatric symptoms can also be reactivated resulting from chronic, complicated and serious infections such as HIV that can lead to depression, anxiety or adjustment disorders, although CNS involvement can also be a possible etiological factor. Patients suffering from primary and severe psychiatric disorders are at increased risk of contracting infection; that is mainly related to high risk behaviors in patients with mania or schizophrenia. It is also important to consider that the co-occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and infection can be incidental (i.e. infectious diseases can occur in psychiatric patients regardless of the above mentioned factors). Early identification of the underlying etiology for organic/secondary psychiatric symptoms is essential for appropriate intervention and early treatment of the primary condition that could be the etiology of psychiatric symptoms so as to avoid unnecessary long-term psychiatric treatment and to avoid complications of possible misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of the primary condition.",

It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

      "title": "First-episode psychosis induced by pregabalin withdrawal: a case report",
      "abstract": "Pregabalin is a novel isomer of gamma-aminobutyric acid that functions as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It is used daily in medical practice for treating neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, generalized anxiety disorder, and partial seizures. Due to its anti-glutamatergic effects, it poses a potential addiction risk. For example, an abrupt discontinuation of this substance may cause patients to exhibit physical withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and diarrhoea. However, there is no information in the literature that addresses whether the rapid discontinuation of pregabalin can cause psychosis to occur. Here we presented a 20-year-old patient with his first episode of psychosis that was likely attributable to his withdrawal from a high dosage pregabalin. He lacked physical signs of withdrawal; however, a psychiatric examination was conducted. It was determined that the patient was experiencing paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations, and mutism. Furthermore, he had engaged in self-mutilative actions and had attempted suicide. Due to the short time frame between the rapid discontinuation of a relatively large dose of pregabalin and the onset of the patient's first episode of psychosis, it is likely that the psychotic episode was triggered by the cessation of the medication. This is the first known case of psychosis that was caused by the rapid withdrawal of pregabalin to be discussed in the literature. The results of this clinical case may guide clinicians to recognize the symptoms of acute pregabalin withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Two notions about schizophrenia have persisted: (1) it is characterized by onset in adolescence or early adulthood, and (2) it has a progressively deteriorating course. Recent studies focusing on early-adulthood- and middle-age-onset schizophrenia challenge these views. Patients with early-onset schizophrenia and middle-age-onset schizophrenia (MAOS) are similar in terms of family history of schizophrenia, presence of minor physical anomalies, early childhood maladjustment, severity of positive symptoms, presence of gross structural abnormalities on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, overall pattern of neuropsychologic deficits, and qualitative response to neuroleptic medications. Differences include a higher proportion of women among MAOS patients, and the tendency for MAOS patients to have less severe negative symptoms, better neuropsychologic performance (particularly in learning and abstraction/cognitive flexibility), and possibly larger thalamic volume and to respond to lower doses of neuroleptic medications. While onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in very late life may reflect an acquired condition that is not \"true schizophrenia,\" and that may be labeled \"very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis,\" findings suggest that true schizophrenia can arise after early adulthood. Middle-age-onset schizophrenia is predominantly neurodevelopmental, but it is also a distinct neurobiological subtype of schizophrenia. Our studies also demonstrate that neuropsychologic functioning remains stable in chronic schizophrenia outpatients, even when observed over several years and in the presence of significant fluctuations in the severity of clinical symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Acute poisoning and toxicity refer to the rapid onset of symptoms caused by the ingestion of toxic substances, often leading to life-threatening complications. Prompt assessment, diagnosis, and management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Initial medical assessment involves a two-pronged approach: addressing life-threatening emergencies and ordering diagnostic studies to identify the cause of the patient's condition. Management focuses on supporting the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) and addressing immediate threats from ingested toxins. This may include interventions like intubation, mechanical ventilation, or administering antidotes. Shock resulting from toxins is managed with IV fluids and vasopressor medications. Specific antidotes, such as Digibind for digoxin toxicity or hydroxocobalamin for cyanide, may be used. Enhanced elimination techniques like hemodialysis or sodium bicarbonate drips can be employed for certain toxins. Diagnosis often relies on identifying toxidromes—distinct patterns of signs and symptoms associated with groups of pharmacologically similar drugs or toxins. Common toxidromes can includeopioid, sedative-hypnotic, sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, or cholinergic. Laboratory tests, including blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, and drug screening, play a crucial role in confirming the specific toxin or toxidrome.",

      "title": "Communicating Auditory Impairments Using Electroacoustic Composition",
      "abstract": "Changes in human sensory perception can occur for a variety of reasons. In the case of distortions or transformations in the human auditory system, the aetiology may include factors such as medical conditions affecting cognition or physiology, interaction of the ears with mechanical waves, or stem from chemically induced sources, such the consumption of alcohol. These changes may be permanent, intermittent, or temporary. In order to communicate such effects to an audience in an accessible, and easily understood manner, a series of electroacoustic compositions were produced. This concept follows on from previous work on the theme of representing auditory hallucinations. Specifically, these compositions relate to auditory impairments that humans can experience due to tinnitus or through the consumption of alcohol. In the case of tinnitus, whilst much is known about the causes and symptoms, the experience of what it is like to live with tinnitus is less explored and those who have acquired the condition may often feel frustration when trying to convey the experience of ‘what it is like’ for them. In terms of impairment from alcohol consumption, whilst there is much hearsay, little research exists on the immediate and short-term effects of alcohol consumption on the human auditory system, despite over half of the UK population reported as consuming alcohol in 2017. The methodology employed to design these compositions draws upon scientific research findings, including experimental and explorative studies involving human participants, coupled with electroacoustic composition techniques. The pieces are typically constructed by mixing field recordings with synthesised materials and incorporating a range of temporal and frequency domain manipulations to the elements therein. In this way, the listener is able to experience the phenomenon in a recognisable context, where distortions of reality can be emulated to varying degrees. It is intended that these compositions can serve as easily accessible and understood examples of auditory impairments and that they might find utility in the communication of symptoms to those who have never experienced the underlying causes or conditions. This presents opportunities for pieces like these to be used in scenarios such as education and public health awareness campaigns.",

Not only clinically manifest seizures but also subclinical discharges could disturb the psychic condition of epileptic patients. Epileptic seizures are probably a reason for neuronal damage in the hippocampus area. Psychogenic reactions and undesired effects of antiepileptic drugs have to be considered aside from functional disturbances due to epileptic seizures.",

The Hoigné syndrome that follows application of procaine penicillin is different to that following benzathine penicillin: lung embolism symptoms remain far in the background in the former case but are the dominant symptoms in the latter. The risk of death is slight in the case of the Hoigné syndrome following procaine penicillin application, but it definitely exists. There are probably many slight and misidentified forms of the Hoigné syndrome induced by procaine penicillin. So far, in 7 cases of Hoigné syndrome, we have observed that the syndrome is followed by certain psychopathological symptoms that we wish to call the Styx syndrome.",

The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders. Since he did not respond to other treatments, we decided to try therapy with topiramate; as a result, the episodes disappeared, tolerance was excellent and effectiveness was maintained throughout the two years' follow-up.In this paper we review eating disorders that occur during sleep, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder and its therapeutic possibilities, while highlighting the usefulness of topiramate to treat this condition.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Drug refractory epilepsy, defined as a failure of adequate trials of two (or more) tolerated, appropriately chosen, and appropriately used antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens (whether administered as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve freedom from seizures, affects approximately 30% of patients with new-onset epilepsy. Persistent epileptic seizures in these patients, in addition to having deleterious effects on health, are also associated with psychosocial, behavioral, cognitive, and financial consequences. Despite availability of several new drugs, response to therapy remains poor in most of drug refractory cases. Also despite several ongoing treatment trials, ideal combination of AEDs remains to be identified. Careful attention to ruling out alternative diagnoses, optimal selection of AEDs, rational use of combination therapy, as well as attention to patient-specific factors, such as poor compliance and drug abuse, remain cornerstone of therapy. In view of poor response to polytherapy, if possible, surgical intervention should be contemplated early. In future, development of new drugs with better efficacy and tolerability and minimal drug interactions, as well as better nonpharmacological therapeutic techniques, will help in managing these patients better.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Several neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in elders with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) can be part of a major depressive episode (MDE) or a “subthreshold” depressive episode. Certain neuropsychiatric symptoms of CIND are essential symptoms of MDE (e.g. dysphoria, anhedonia), while other are non-essential symptoms (NESD; e.g. fatigue, insomnia, cognitive complaint). Contrary to essential symptoms, NESD are not specific to MDE and are present in other disorders. It is unknown whether NESD are linked to CIND in absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. The present study examined the association between NESD and probable CIND in elders without essential MDE symptoms. Methods: Participants were 2028 community-dwelling individuals aged 65–96 years who had not experienced dysphoria/anhedonia during the year preceding the interview. Semi-structured in-home interviews evaluated the following NESD: alteration of appetite, sleep disturbance, psychomotor alteration, fatigue/loss of energy, worthlessness/guilt, and cognitive complaints. Probable CIND cases were defined based on the Mini-mental State Examination cut-offs (15th percentile) stratified for age, education and sex. Results: Symptoms of fatigue/loss of energy (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.42–4.09), sleep disturbance (OR: 3.04 CI: 1.69–5.46) and cognitive complaints (OR: 2.86 CI: 1.71–4.77) were significantly associated with CIND. These associations were not modified after adjustments for potential confounders (age, education level, sex, benzodiazepine use, chronic diseases, and brain disorders). Conclusion: A psychiatric symptomatology occurs in older adults with CIND in the absence of MDE or subthreshold MDE. NESD encountered in the absence of dysphoria/anhedonia should receive particular attention by clinicians since they can be linked to cognitive difficulties.",

Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats.

      "title": "Provoked models of asthma: what have we learnt?",
      "abstract": "Summary Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by physiological abnormalities of variable airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to a wide variety of physical and inhaled chemical stimuli and the presence of symptoms. AHR is measured by challenging the airways with a variety of agonists and naturally occurring stimuli, which results in constriction of the airway smooth muscle, leading to airway narrowing and airflow limitation. There are two distinct mechanisms by which the airways can narrow to a constrictor stimulus and these are defined by the pathways they take to induce AHR. Direct stimuli are pharmacological agents administered exogenously (such as histamine or methacholine) that act ‘directly’ on specific receptors on the bronchial smooth muscle to cause constriction. The other mechanism by which the airway can narrow is via the inhalation of indirect stimuli, which include natural stimuli, such as allergen or exercise, and pharmacological agents such as adenosine monophosphate and hyper‐osmotic agents (e.g. hypertonic saline or dry powder mannitol). These stimuli induce airway narrowing ‘indirectly’ by causing the endogenous release of mediators of bronchoconstriction from airway inflammatory cells. Provoked models of asthma have been extremely valuable in understanding the pathobiology of asthma, in aiding diagnosis, in helping to clarify the mechanisms of actions of effective drugs and in the development of new entities to treat asthma. Some provoked models are valuable clinically, particularly those that measure direct AHR, while others, particularly allergen challenge, have been used in animal models and in humans to study the mechanisms of allergen‐induced airway inflammation and the associated physiological changes, as well in the development of new drugs for asthma. An emerging role for measurements of AHR is in the evaluation of the optimal treatment for patients with asthma.",

      "abstract": "The signs of metabolic disorders often present in differently in sedated patients versus patients who are not sedated. In general, causes of delayed awakening can be separated into drug effects, pathophysiologic effects and surgical causes. The persistence of an anesthetic drug effect can occur with patients who are pharmacologically prone to a greater than expected drug response or prolonged drug action, or in cases of drug overdose. Retention of carbon dioxide despite adequate oxygen saturation can lead to CO2 narcosis and delay recovery. Although the CO2 levels necessary cause narcosis are high, this scenario is possible with a COPD patient, who is hypoventilating during the administration of supplemental O2. Hyperglycemia can cause persistence of unconsciousness due to the formation of a hyperosmolar state with diuresis. Electrolyte abnormalities and hypothermia have been associated with delayed recovery in the hospitalized patient.",

      "abstract": "Many patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute intoxication, serious complication of overdose, or withdrawal symptoms of illicit drugs. An acute withdrawal of drugs with addiction potential is associated with a sympathetic overactivity leading to marked psychomimetic disturbances. Acute intoxication or withdrawal of such drugs is often associated with life-threatening complications which require ICU admission and necessitate prolonged sedative analgesic medications, weaning from which is often complicated by withdrawal and other psychomimetic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 (α(2)) agonist, has been used successfully to facilitate withdrawal and detoxification of various drugs and also to control delirium in ICU patients. Herein, we report a case of a chronic opioid abuse (heroin) patient admitted with acute overdose complications leading to a prolonged ICU course requiring sedative-analgesic medication; the drug withdrawal-related symptoms further complicated the weaning process. Dexmedetomidine infusion was successfully used as a sedative-analgesic to control the withdrawal-related psychomimetic symptoms and to facilitate smooth detoxification and weaning from opioid and other sedatives.",

The symptoms disappeared after the medication was reintroduced but recurred after rediscontinuation. When the dosage was diminished very gradually the symptoms were mild. The depression did not recur. Such withdrawal symptoms are most prevalent after discontinuation of paroxetine but can occur after use of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The withdrawal syndrome includes both physical and psychiatric symptoms and needs to be distinguished from a relapse of the psychiatric disorder. Good information and gradual discontinuation of the antidepressant after long-term use are adequate measures to prevent severe withdrawal symptoms.",

In the case of the latter, catatonia mostly resolves when the seizures respond to the anticonvulsive treatment. We report, to our knowledge, the first case of a patient without affective or psychotic disorder, who developed catatonia in the postictum and whose catatonia did not resolve with anticonvulsive treatment, but did so with lorazepam. We describe a 36-year-old man, with no psychiatric history, except for a possible disorder in the use of cannabis, who developed catatonia after epileptic seizures. The catatonia did not respond to the anticonvulsant therapy, but did so to lorazepam 17 mg/d. Lorazepam could be tapered slowly and stopped without reemergence of catatonic signs. Catatonia should be part of the differential diagnosis in patients with bradyphrenia and/or remarkable postictal behavior. This report shows that lorazepam should be taken into consideration (before moving to ECT), in cases of unresolved catatonia, even if the seizures are reduced with anticonvulsants.",

Central apnea is characterized by absence of respiratory effort, whereas obstructive apnea is characterized by continuous respi-ratory effort without airflow. Mixed apneas have both central and obstructive features without intervention of normal respiration.Obstructive apnea is considered clinically significant regardless of presence of desaturation or arousals. Cen-tral apnea is clinically significant only if it is followed by hemoglobin desaturation by at least 3% or by an arousal. It is also evaluated as significant when it lasts more than 20 seconds, regardless of presence of arousal or desatura-tion.Hypopnea is defined as reduction in airflow wave-form width by at least 50% compared to width recorded at the longest period of normal sleep, for at least two re-spiratory cycles. Clinically significant hypopneas have duration greater than two respiratory cycles and are as-sociated with hemoglobin desaturation by at least 3% or with an arousal.Primary snoring describes presence of snoring with-out apnea or hypopnea, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, high arousal index, disruption of normal sleep architecture or daytime symptoms.",

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

PBA can significantly impact the quality of life of patients affected as these spells can be inappropriate to the social setting or incompatible with the patient's emotional state. The underlying mechanism of PBA appears to be associated with disinhibition in neuronal pathways involving dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. One hypothesis for the pathology of PBA is that it is the result of disruption of the corticopontine-cerebellar circuits, impairing cerebellar modulation of affect, and leading to uncontrolled emotional lability. Stroke, and other neurological disorders, interrupt these neuronal circuits causing disinhibition of the voluntary control of emotional expression. It is extremely important to recognize and appropriately diagnose the condition. We present a case report of an 85-year-old female patient who presented with a thalamic stroke, and she subsequently developed hypomania with symptoms of decreased need for sleep, mood lability, pressured speech, and religious preoccupation. This case discusses a unique presentation of PBA with hypomania.",

POCD leads to decreased quality of life and increased mortality. Various reports describe the occurrence and risk factor of POCD in adopting different neuropsychological tests and different follow-up periods. POCD is highly associated with age or inflammation in the central nerve system. Anti-inflammatory strategies including dexmedetomidine, statin or minocycline in the perioperative period may reduce incidence of POCD.",

      "abstract": "In this review, the recent findings of central nervous system (CNS) or peripheral nervous system (PNS) dysfunction induced by occupational exposure to organic solvents are described. While acute, high-level exposure to almost all organic solvents causes the general, nonspecific depression of CNS, it is still not clear whether chronic, low-level occupational exposure causes the chronic neurological dysfunction which has been called \"organic solvent syndrome\", \"painters syndrome\", \"psycho-organic syndrome\" or \"chronic solvent encephalopathy\". At least at lower than occupational exposure limits, chronic and low-level organic solvent exposure does not appear to cause the \"sy mptomatic\" neurological dysfunction. The chronic, moderate- to high-level exposure to a few organic solvents (such as carbon disulfide, n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone) affects CNS or PNS specifically. The substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, 2-bromopropane and 1-bromopropane were shown to have the peripheral nerve toxicity in the experimental animals. Shortly after these observations, human cases of 1-bromopropane intoxication with the dysfunction of CNS and PNS were reported in the United States. Neurological abnormalities in workers of a 1-bromopropane factory in China were also reported. Thus, the possible neurotoxicity of newly introduced substitutes for ozone-depleting solvents into the workplace must be considered. Enough evidences indicate that some common solvents (such as toluene and styrene) induce sensorineural hearing loss and acquired color vision disturbances in workers. In some studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral atrophy, patchy periventricular hyperintensities and hypointensities in the basal ganglia were found in solvent-exposed workers as have been shown in toluene abusers (toluene leukoencephalopathy). Further studies using the neurobehavioral test batteries, neurophysiological measurements and advanced neuroimaging techniques are required to detect the \"subclinical\" dysfunction of nervous systems in workers exposed to organic solvents at low-level.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

This may apply to such frequently prescribed drugs as antihistamines, antidepressants and neuroleptic agents, antibiotics, lipid lowering drugs, and many others. Negative chronotropic, inotropic or dromotropic effects, changes in pre- and afterload with a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output, or the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias have all been reported upon treatment with extracardiac drugs. Physicians mostly fail to consider that these adverse events may well be related to drug effects, but rather ascribe them to the underlying disease or variations in the course of the patient's illness. Recent characteristic examples of the cardiovascular effects of extracardiac drugs are the cardiac arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) caused by the H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine and astemizole. These observations were made only many years after the availability of these drugs on the market-- in some countries even as over-the-counter drugs. In general, both the number of drugs causing undesired cardiac events and the different types of adverse cardiovascular reactions ascribable to these drugs appear to be on the increase.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

The symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning are non-specific, and include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache or confusion, and even coma or death in patients with more serious neuronal damage. Delayed encephalopathy is another clinical problem that may occur after a recovery from the acute stage of carbon monoxide poisoning. It is clinically characterized by a recurrence of neurological or psychiatric symptoms, which are usually misdiagnosed as psychosis or drug abuse, among others. We report herein a patient who was initially misdiagnosed with psychosis. After a detailed history-taking, neurological and psychiatric examination, and imaging studies, he was diagnosed with delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) of CO intoxication. The symptoms improved significantly after hyperbaric oxygen therapy. According to our experience in the management of CO intoxication, DNS is easily misdiagnosed due to its non-specific symptoms. Hence, clinically, we should keep in mind delayed sequelae after initial recovery in acute CO intoxication, and that hyperbaric oxygen often works in such a situation.",

      "title": "Understanding depression beyond the “mind‐body” dichotomy",
      "abstract": "In both the ICD-11 and the DSM-5, the core symptoms of depression are reported to be depressed mood (e.g., feeling sad, down or hopeless) and markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities. However, in the ICD-10 diagnostic guidelines, a third core symptom was also identified: \"fatigue or low energy\". In two regions of the world (Latin America and East Asia), \"fatigue\" is the most commonly experienced depressive symptom1. In a third region (Southeast Asia), \"issues with the heart\" are the most commonly reported depressive symptoms, along with depressed mood1. Do people in these regions just \"somatize\" what is primarily a \"psychological\" experience? Do \"somatic\" symptoms just represent a \"mask\", as implied some decades ago by the concept of \"masked depression\"2? An alternative view may be that the core of the depressive syndrome, at least in part of the cases of this heterogeneous condition, is neither only \"psychic\" nor only \"somatic\", but consists of an actual \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli (partially captured by the constructs of depressed mood, fatigue, and diminished interest or pleasure), along with an overwhelming feeling of psychic/physical pain (which has a complex and probably variable relationship to the cognitive component of the syndrome). The way these core phenomena are perceived, elaborated and verbalized by the affected person likely depends upon how that person generally functions and appraises her functioning (e.g., how rich and articulated her cognitive life is, or how much she is focused on her body and its functioning), upon the influence of the cultural environment in which she is immersed, and upon the pattern of predisposing and precipitating factors at work in that individual case. Feelings involving the heart (\"heavy heart\", \"heart pain\"; chest tightness, weakness or excessive tension; palpitations) do not appear in textbook descriptions of depression, but are more frequently experienced by depressed individuals than we use to believe1. Ordinary people sometimes refer to depression as \"broken heart\", and we tend to regard this as a metaphor. But, the acute \"broken heart syndrome\" – which has the same precipitating factors as depression and, similarly to the heart involvement in depression, is ascribed to a sympathetic overactivation – is now a recognized clinical entity3. An intrinsic cardiac nervous system (\"a brain in the heart\") has been recently described4, including a multitude of nervous ganglions consisting not only of neurons receiving sympathetic and parasympathetic input, but also of intracardiac interneurons which act as processors of information. Indeed, the heart conveys to the brain more information than the brain sends to the heart, and ascending fibres in the vagus nerve are more numerous than descending ones. Could the above dynamics be an under-recognized factor contributing to the frequent coexistence (\"comorbidity\") and complex interaction between depression and heart disease? That many patients with a diagnosis of depression do not respond adequately to two subsequent antidepressant medications (\"treatment resistance\") is not surprising. Clinical trials of both medications and psychotherapies for depression have aimed during the past few decades to document the \"equivalence\" of any new experimental intervention to an already consolidated one, while \"differences\" in the profiles of action of those interventions have usually not been a focus of attention. Consequently, antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies for depression are regarded by treatment guidelines as essentially all \"equivalent\" to each other. It is only recently that secondary analyses of large trial databases, conducted using innovative methodologies, have started to focus again on the \"differences\" between the various antidepressants, and between antidepressants and evidence-based psychotherapies, with respect to their profiles of action5, 6. On the other hand, it is not common in ordinary practice that a patient with a diagnosis of depression receives a detailed clinical characterization beyond that diagnosis, guiding the choice of treatment. It is therefore understandable that a person may receive two or more antidepressants that, although validated for depression tout court, are not among the most appropriate for her specific case, and consequently may not elicit an adequate response. Furthermore, medications do not work in a vacuum: a variety of \"aspecific\" factors (e.g., the therapeutic relationship, family dynamics, the socio-cultural context) may affect the outcome of an intrinsically efficacious intervention. The concept of \"pseudo-resistance\" does not adequately consider at the moment these factors (not to mention problems with the definition of what is an \"adequate response\" to an antidepressant, difficulties in ascertaining the adherence to the antidepressant regimens that have been used, and the basic incongruence of defining a case as \"treatment-resistant\" when one group of therapies currently regarded as first-line in the treatment of depression, i.e. psychotherapies, have not been tried). In this issue of the journal, two papers and a Forum deal, respectively, with the lived experience of depression7, with its multiple \"physical comorbidities\"8, and (in a critical vein) with \"treatment-resistant depression\" and its management9. I think these contributions should be welcome by the scientific community, by people with depression and their families, and by the public at large. A \"depression\" of the individual's psychic/physical tone, energy, drive and/or response to rewarding stimuli may be the outcome of repeated and inescapable adverse events, but also of a disruption of circadian rhythms, a non-psychiatric disease, or the use of certain medications. Or it may occur in the absence of any such evidence as far as the person is aware of, as often happens in bipolar disorder. Perhaps research should more actively focus on those core phenomena, building on the reports of experts by experience and exploring their biological correlates, without any prejudice about whether they are primarily or essentially psychic or physical in nature. The effects of the various antidepressant medications could perhaps be explored – beyond current stereotypes – in the same light (are they psychophysical \"tonics\"?; do they have energizing or disinhibiting properties?; do they affect reward responsiveness?; do they impact psychic/physical pain?), through a more in-depth and nuanced reconstruction of patients' experiences of \"response\" to those agents, and a more targeted investigation of their biological correlates. The same may apply to the effects of other interventions, from physical exercise and behavioural activation to neurostimulation techniques. Neuroscientific explorations of depression should probably look at the autonomic as well as the central nervous system (and at their interactions with the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems in addition to the immune and endocrine ones). Finally (or first of all), some more psychopathological sophistication should perhaps be added to the current conceptualization and description of \"depression\".",

      "abstract": "Rampant caries is one of the hallmarks of chronic methamphetamine abuse. \"Meth\" is a potent central nervous system stimulant with physical and psychological effects similar to cocaine. It is the author's opinion that the caries associated with methamphetamine abuse is related to three risk factors: 1) xerostomia caused by the drug; 2) a subsequent increase in sugared soft drink consumption; and 3) lack of oral hygiene during extended periods of abuse. Patients in this risk group usually present for treatment due to severe pain. However, they may be reluctant to discuss their illegal drug habit. Anorexia may also be present. Treatment includes cessation of drug abuse, oral hygiene, restrictions on sugar intake, and daily fluoride supplementation. Such patients tend to exhibit poor compliance with treatment recommendations or fail to show for appointments.",

      "title": "A Person with Factitious Disorder Presenting with Acute Stroke-Like Symptoms and Receiving Thrombolytic Therapy Twice",
      "abstract": "One of the challenges in acute stroke management is accurately differentiating between actual ischemic events and other conditions that mimic stroke. In a cohort of 821 consecutive patients admitted to an acute stroke unit, 13% were incorrectly diagnosed as stroke [1]. In another cohort of 411 patients, it was estimated that 19% of patients presenting to the emergency department with stroke-like symptoms ultimately have other diagnoses such as a postictal state, metabolic disturbances, and systemic infections [2]. Regardless of the actual percentage, it is clear that not all cases of acute stroke-like symptoms are true strokes and other mimics should be considered. One such mimic is factitious disorder. \r\nFactitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which afflicted individuals exaggerate symptoms and even endorse medical illness, or psychological trauma in order to draw attention or sympathy to themselves. The DSM-IV criteria for this disorder are: 1) Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms; 2) The motivation for the behavior is to assume the sick role; and 3)\r\nExternal incentives for the behavior such as economic gain or avoiding legal responsibility as seen in malingering, are absent [3].\r\nHere, we present a case of a patient who was diagnosed with factitious disorder after he presented to two different institutions with acute stroke-like symptoms and received tissue plasminogen activator\r\n(t-PA) twice within the span of 3 weeks.",

      "title": "The Transformation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: From Neurosis to Neurobiology",
      "abstract": "Lives can be severely disrupted after a momentous negative experience. Particularly potent are unexpected negative events, or “traumas,” such as a near death experience, a severe injury, or being exposed to intense interpersonal violence or a natural disaster. Although most people recover from these traumatic events, many do not, and experience persistent fear, anxiety and/or depression following the event. In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma. These gains from the study of memory and neurohormonal reactivity and control systems hold forth the promise of improved, biologically-informed, psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the future.",

      "title": "[Why do patients find it difficult to discontinue their medication?]",
      "abstract": "Tapering medication is difficult for many patients using chronic medication. Physicians must be aware of why patients experience difficulties in discontinuation. Important are the cognitions of patients about why the medication is necessary, for example because of the deficit of a certain substance that is supplemented by the medication. Or a too favourable expectation of the effect while time-to-benefit has passed. The experience of withdrawal effects during earlier attempts or the experience of dependency hamper new attempts to stop. This is important in medication that induces physical dependency: antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or proton pump inhibitors. Fear for relapse is also hampering discontinuation; this is at stake in patients with psychosis, depression and epilepsy. Finally, poor communication and not having a trusted professional are impediments for discontinuation. To be successful in helping patients discontinue their medication professionals must communicate well about the patient's personal attitude, experience, emotions, and life circumstances as well as to possess expertise about the technical aspects of the procedure of stopping medication.",

      "abstract": "Three cases of dyskinesia attributable to selective serotonergic antidepressant drugs are presented. The patients were not on other medication nor had they been in preceding weeks. The movement disorder disappeared on cessation of the drug within a time period corresponding to the expected wash-out for the different preparations. The emergence of dyskinesic symptoms coincided with a significant deterioration in mental state after an initial good response to the particular medication. Considering the apparently selective action of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, these cases suggest that movement disorders and psychiatric symptoms are unlikely to be due to single neurotransmitter mechanisms and that a disturbance of the balance between the different systems is a more likely hypothesis.",

As the experts 7 certified specialists (psychiatrists, psychologists and others) were involved. In the research the academically definitions and the clinical case descriptions of the following clinical phenomena were estimated: Conversion, obsession, neurasthenia, phobia, derealisation/depersonalization, anxiety (partly specific for neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders); True hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, fixation hypomnesia, anecphoria (partly specific for organic mental disorders); Pseudo hallucinations, delusion of control, automatism, paralogia, emotional withdrawal, autism, ambivalence (common symptoms of schizophrenia); Inability to feel, sadness, lassitude, euphoria, excitement as the signs of endogenous affective disorders. Mainly non-specific phenomenon - persecutory delusions. Thus were obtained 14 estimates for each item on a 100-point scale. Dispersion of majority ranges was too high to get significant differences. But 6 from 7 experts significantly (p<0.05) and 1 tendentionally (p<0.01) rated 3 symptoms (autism, conversion and paralogia) as relatively more complex as compared with 7 more simplex phenomena (anxiety, confusion, euphoria, excitement, neurasthenia, phobia and sadness) by U-Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney criteria. established ranges of psychopathological phenomena's complexity reveal non-linear relations to etiology but in some cases they can be useful instrument of differential diagnostics of mental disorders.",
