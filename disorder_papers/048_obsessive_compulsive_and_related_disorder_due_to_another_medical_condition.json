      "title": "Prevalence of Fatigue Among Female Academicians",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue. Key words: Chadler Fatigue Scale, Female Academicians, Fatigue.",

      "title": "Estrés laboral y sus consecuencias en la salud que afectan el rendimiento",
      "abstract": "Work stress is defined as the emotional and/or physical reaction that the human being has in situations that surround him; in addition it can also be defined as a physiological and psychological response of the worker. Studies on job stress have revealed that lately this problem or condition has greatly affected people who work as workers; since the consequences of suffering stress from work are sufficient, they are also serious and in some cases difficult to manage. Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor. Be very careful, because if it can be avoided they can cause fatal damage to humans or even cause death.",

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Healthy and Diseased Individuals",
      "abstract": "Objectives: Although fatigue is experienced by everyone, its definition and classification remains under debate. Methods: A review of the previously published data on fatigue. Results: Fatigue is influenced by age, gender, physical condition, type of food, latency to last meal, mental status, psychological conditions, personality type, life experience, and the health status of an individual. Fatigue may not only be a symptom but also a measurable and quantifiable dimension, also known as fatigability. Additionally, it may be classified as a condition occurring at rest or under exercise or stress, as physiologic reaction or pathologic condition, as spontaneous phenomenon or triggerable state, as resistant or irresistant to preconditioning, training, or attitude, as prominent or collateral experience, and as accessible or inaccessible to any type of treatment or intervention. Fatigue may be the sole symptom of a disease or one among others. It may be also classified as acute or chronic. Quantification of fatigability is achievable by fatigue scores, force measurement, electromyography, or other means. Fatigue and fatigability need to be delineated from conditions such as sleepiness, apathy, exhaustion, exercise intolerance, lack of vigor, weakness, inertia, or tiredness. Among neurological disorders, the prevalence of fatigue is particularly increased in multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and bleeding and also in neuromuscular disorders. Fatigue may be influenced by training, mental preconditioning, or drugs. Conclusions: Fatigue needs to be recognized as an important condition that is not only a symptom but may also be quantified and can be modified by various measures depending on the underlying cause.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Pruritus ist ein häufiges und quälendes Symptom in der Bevölkerung sowie in ärztlichen Praxen. Ziel der Arbeit Der vorliegende Beitrag gibt einen Überblick über die Systematik psychischer Faktoren in Entstehung bzw. Verlauf des Pruritus sowie Hinweise zu ihrer jeweiligen Diagnostik Material und Methode Es handelt sich um eine Überblicksarbeit. Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "abstract": "Wounds and wound healing are often considered to be purely medical phenomena, but there is growing evidence that the psychological impact on the patient is of equal importance. The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

      "title": "Physical Trauma, Psychological Stress, and Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract It seems clear that physical trauma and/or psychological stress can either cause or exacerbate certain medical conditions. For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

      "title": "Jail Syndrome",
      "abstract": "\"Jail syndrome\" is a condition emerging in individuals of high profile and status facing legal repercussions due to involvement in corruption or other illegal activities. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of symptoms, including anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosomatic symptoms such as chest pain, headache, hysterical attacks, and many more with minimal positive investigations and other evaluations. Its prevalence is notably high among high-profile individuals such as politicians and bureaucrats in contexts marked by corruption, especially in India. The onset of symptoms typically occurs in response to arrest or legal proceedings, complicating clinical diagnosis due to the lack of identifiable organic causes. Distinguishing jail syndrome from genuine medical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes is crucial for effective management. The syndrome reflects a circumstantial diagnosis influenced by the psychological stress of legal consequences, necessitating a careful assessment of both psychological and physiological health. Large-scale studies, research, and data analysis are essential to validate jail syndrome as a recognized clinical diagnosis. Jail syndrome is a self-explanatory clinical diagnosis to convey the onset of symptomatology, etiopathology, and treatment strategy in a person involved in illicit activities with history of charges, imprisonment, or sentencing to jail. Most important is to rule out organic disease because many times organic causes such as acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension (HT) are present. Very important is that large-scale data and their scientific analysis are required to confirm and recognize it as a definite clinical diagnosis of \"jail syndrome.\" No doubt the term jail syndrome is self-explanatory and conveys the message we want to convey.",

Established treatment options in chronic fatigue syndrome are graded exercise, antidepressants in case of depression and anxiety, and cognitive behaviour treatment. The large number of other treatments including diets have no proven value. Fatigue remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the physician.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

People with PTSD experience one or more major symptoms that include flashbacks and paranoia, difficulty in interpersonal relationships, and problems engaging in work and activities of daily living. In severe cases they can harm themselves or the others; but these events are preventable by appropriate therapies. PTSD is a well-characterized serious psychological and behavioural abnormality that occurs after exposure to one or more acute severe stressful events. It often occurs among soldiers returning from battlefields and the civilian victims of war. However, it also occurs in non-war situations, such as terrorist attacks or serious accidents; sexual abuse, rape, or other violent acts; and school or workplace bullying, harassment, or retaliation. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of PTSD is made too infrequently, particularly in the post-conflict periods in developing countries. This is in part because of inadequate awareness but also due to limited resources and expertise. Consequently, the resources for clinical care and research are diverted to other forms of behavioral issues, such as adjustment disorders. The treatment of PTSD needs to be well coordinated so that all stakeholders work synergistically using the resources necessary for the prolonged treatment and follow-ups. PTSD is underdiagnosed, and even misdiagnosed or mislabeled as depression or adjustment disorders. The failure to make a timely diagnosis or mislabeling of PTSD likely will harm victims and their families and may lead to negative outcomes, including suicide.

It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task. To the extent that a person's job fulfill his expectations and values, the job will be satisfying. The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization.

      "abstract": "The psychic reevocation of disturbance of the colon or disturbances of other body districts not felt by the patient at the time facilitates the accentuation of colon motility or tone, leading to the exacerbation of the pathogenetic premises of the disturbances complained of. The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

Each is a definite syndrome with specific diagnostic criteria and a well-documented natural history.

Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

      "title": "Psyche, personality and gut functions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

Pain is a subjective experience that cannot be measured or “objectively” verified by other individuals. Reactions to pain, however, can be registered by others. Pain in the orofacial area may have several etiological explanations. Since the functional pattern of the area is multi‐faceted, persisting pain in the area most likely has a multi‐factorial background, and also a variety of effects. Treatment should be made considering delicate diagnostical distinctions. A thorough clinical examination contains lots of treatment components.

It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing.

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "title": "Medically unexplained physical symptoms",
      "abstract": "Concern about physical symptoms is a common reason for people to seek medical help. Many of these symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, weakness, dizziness, and fatigue, remain unexplained by identi­fiable disease even after careful medical assessment. Several general terms have been used to describe these types of symptom— somatoform, medically un­explained, and functional. We prefer the terms ‘med­ically unexplained physical symptom’ or ‘functional symptom’, because they imply a disturbance of some kind in bodily functioning without implying that the symptom is psychogenic. Patients and doctors often assume that a physical symptom implies that a phys­ical pathology exists. However, commonly experienced and often severe, distressing, and disabling symp­toms, such as menstrual pain or ‘tension headache’, indicate that this is not always the case. By assuming that a physical symptom is explained by physical dis­ease/ pathology, we may be subjecting the patient to unnecessary tests and hospital visits, adding to pa­tient distress, and failing to deliver the integrated management required. There are many kinds of these symptoms (Box 25.1), presenting across healthcare settings. They are con­sidered in this psychiatry textbook because (1) psy­chological factors (including, at times, psychiatric disorder) are important in aetiology and (2) psycho­logical and behavioural interventions have a funda­mental role in treatment A major obstacle to effective management of pa­tients with functional symptoms is that they feel their doctor does not believe them. They are concerned that they may be thought to be ‘putting it on’. Note that the deliberate manufacture or exaggeration of symptoms or signs (malingering) is quite different (see p. 359). Diagnoses of three kinds may be given: … ● Descriptive physical syndromes. These include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, non- cardiac chest pain, chronic pain syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Although the specific terms are useful in everyday medical practice, there is substantial overlap, and many patients with, for example, fibromyalgia will also have IBS. ● Psychiatric syndromes as the primary cause of the functional symptoms. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and adjustment, are common primary causes of functional symptoms, and commonly present via the general hospital’s emergency department or cardiology clinic.",

      "title": "La depresión: ¿un trastorno dimensional o categorial?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY One of the crucial subjects, either for the clinical or scientific activity, is the dimensional or categorical character of depression and other mental diseases. Each approach is different from the theoretical and epistemological points of view. At presence, the categorical model for the definition and estimation of the presence of a disorder are reflected in the data on epidemiology, the results of investigations, instruments and the interventions. These elements are related to a system of thinking which results in a particular form of conceiving the psychopathology and intervention. Nevertheless, the strong influence of the categorical model in which the disorders are defined as a group of accomplished criteria has not prevented from development of a dimensional model. The latter postulates the existence of a continuum between the normality and pathology which correspond with dimensions, levels and severity related to the certain behaviours, traits or even symptoms. The interest in the dimensional approach to psychopathology, in general and in mood disorders, is caused by the observation in clinics which indicate, for example, that many patients do not improve with medicines and present residual symptoms during long periods of time. For these reasons, some personality factors which would explain the chronic symptoms of disorders have been proposed in Psychology and Psychiatry. Although the diagnostic manuals consider different types of mood disorders, many investigations have showed the possibility to consider depression as a continuum, where the least severe extreme would be the depressive personality and the most severe, major depression. According to the abovementioned proposal, it is possible that some people present certain vulnerability which would explain the different answers in case of depression. Cognitive factors, together with social and genetic factors increase the risk of chronic depressive symptoms. The catastrophic perception of self, the world and future, the dichotomous thinking and tunnel vision are the cognitive factors associated with the presence of the mood disorders symptoms. Additionally, some studies show the importance of gender, as women are more prone to develop depression and similar disorders which is related to traditional social roles. This can be caused by the need to sacrifice the professional career to dedicate time to housework, or to assume multiple roles. Concerning the genetic factors, the presence of first degree relatives with mood disorders increases the risk of development of depression or dysthymia. The consideration of depressive personality is based on the presence of symptoms which do not fulfil the criteria of severity and frequency of major depression but do affect the mood. The presence of these stable traits is related to major chronicity and worse prognosis. This condition has been described in manuals as dysthymia. Nevertheless, as it remains relatively stable in time it could be understood as a personality disorder. The disorder would be a continuum with the normality similar to this described as neuroticism in which some entities are qualitatively and quantitatively different which represent the categories.",

This creates a strain in the body resulting in some physiological response to the stress. Work stress due to unusual posture or improper postural adjustment to the work results in back pain, headaches, nervousness, aching muscles, excessive perspiration and depressions. The most serious result of work stress is serious traumatic injuries, accumulative injuries or death. Psychological factors that may cause stress are excessive heat, improper furniture (chairs, tables etc.), poor workplace, long work hours or any other type of situation in which individual performs his or her work in unusual situation or in a continuous manner. Ill health results in high rate of absenteeism and turnover, industrial discontent and indiscipline, poor performance and low productivity and more accidents.

      "abstract": "Stress is a term that is readily recognized by everyone but defines rigorous scientific definition. It is widely interpreted as the emotional and biologic responses to novel or threatening situations. In humans, however, the term \"distress\" seems to be preferable, more clearly defining the fact that is the response that is being referred to, rather than the stimulus. Distress has been postulated to be capable of precipitating an overt illness, as when it occurs coincidentally with an incipient infection or neoplasm. Moreover, it is able to provoke several disorders and symptoms in many tissues and organs, including the skin. In this paper the authors focus on the main characteristics of stress and emphasize the relevance of psychosomatic medicine that proposes the simultaneous examination of psyche and soma. Special consideration is given to a peculiar form of skin disease, psychogenic purpura, together with the stigmata of mystics that, in large part, seem to be conditioned or provoked (or provocable) by emotional stress or by psychic influences on cutaneous fibrinolytic activity.",

      "abstract": "Summary Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dysthymia in late life reflects a spectrum of disorders rather than a construct, with multiple biopsychosocial factors that influence how depression is manifested. Symptoms of grief or bereavement may be characterized by agitation, somatic complaint and social withdrawal. Other situational factors may precipitate maladjustment with depressed mood. Of course, general medical problems inherent to late life are associated with loss of autonomy together with increased chronicity of depression and refractoriness to treatment. Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease. Subsyndromal depression may also be present or atypical forms of depression including masked depression with sadness or dysphoria; depressive pseudodementia with reversible cognitive impairment, and hypochondriasis or depression with prominent somatic complaints.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

In cancer patients, it is defined as ‘distressing persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning’. In the majority of patients receiving palliative care, the aetiology of fatigue is multifactorial. The most common factors associated with fatigue include anorexia/cachexia, pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, anaemia, and inflammation. Routine screening for fatigue is essential for optimal assessment of fatigue. Initial management should aim towards identification and treatment of the reversible/underlying causes However, if there are no reversible causes identified or if the fatigue is not responsive to specific treatments, symptomatic treatment should be considered.",

Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest.

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

      "abstract": "Patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) have an obsessive preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance or, if a slight physical abnormality exists, a grossly excessive concern with it. This preoccupation causes significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other functioning. Social anxiety is a prominent component of BDD, and social avoidance resulting from BDD symptoms may markedly impair social functioning. In severe cases, avoidance of social situations in combination with occupational and academic impairment may result in patients becoming housebound. The prevalence of BDD is 1% to 2% in the U.S. population and 11% to 12% in patients with social anxiety disorder. Behaviors associated with BDD include mirror checking, physician visits, hair grooming, use of cosmetics, and social avoidance. Distress over BDD may lead patients to undergo repeated cosmetic surgeries in futile attempts to conceal or correct perceived defects. Additionally, depression and suicide are frequent complications of BDD. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for the management of BDD with coexisting social anxiety are presented in this article.",

It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

      "abstract": "As the field of movement disorders has developed and matured over the past 25 years, psychogenic movement disorders have become increasingly recognized in subspecialty clinics. The diagnosis can be challenging and should be based on positive features rather than a purely exclusionary approach. The clinical phenotype can be quite varied, although certain categories of abnormal movement are more common than others. Electrophysiological studies may be particularly useful in establishing the diagnosis, especially with respect to tremor and myoclonus, and an argument can be made for adding a \"laboratory-supported definite\" category to earlier classification schemes. The diagnosis of psychogenic dystonia remains a major challenge, although there are some recent promising developments with respect to the evaluation of cortical plasticity that require further study. The pathogenesis of psychogenic movement disorders is poorly understood; insights may be provided from the study of other neurological conversion disorders such as psychogenic hemiparesis. Psychogenic movement disorders typically result in considerable disability and negatively impact quality of life to the same or greater extent than do many organic movement disorders. Treatment is extremely challenging, and many patients experience chronic disability despite various therapeutic interventions. Given the personal and societal impact of these problems, further advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis and the subsequent development of effective therapies are sorely needed.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct. The very notion of compensating people whose suffering derives from their reaction to the injuring of others often evokes surprise, indignation and disdain.",

In this way, depressive and addictive disorders are frequent complications of social phobia but they often hide the primary diagnosis because of their severity. The initial and even the main complaint can also be a somatic symptom, which the patient can consider as the most disturbing, without linking it with his social anxiety. It is the case of the patients dreading to blush, shake, sweat, or to produce digestive noises in front of other persons. Finally, some social anxiety disorders have the deceptive appearance of aggressive or cold attitudes. In all these cases, the screening and the treatment of social phobia can have a crucial impact on the global prognosis, with possible significant and enduring improvements of the primary and secondary disorders.",

In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

Factors that influence the site of such persisting symptoms are [1] accidents affecting a particular part of the body; [2] a state of emotional arousal in which a particular action (which persists later) occurs; [3] identification of the patient with another person having a similar symptom or the same organ affected; [4] suggestion about a particular organ or symptoms from other persons; and [5] interference of the symptom with the patient's vocation (or claims to compensation) leading to continuing attention to it. Factors influencing the persistence and location of one symptom after a general reaction to stress form only one group of the relevant causal factors in these disorders.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

      "abstract": "Several characteristics help distinguish MPI in the workplace from illness outbreaks due to physical causes: no laboratory or physical findings confirming an specific organic cause evidence of specific physical or psychological stressors victims are mostly women and those of lower socioeconomic status in the workplace hyperventilation-type symptoms are prominent apparent transmission by audiovisual cues rapid spread of the illness followed by rapid remission of symptoms, unless symptoms are fixed by physicians and litigation benign morbidity If a physical or chemical cause of the illness is not obvious and if episodes recur, the illness remains a mystery and the workplace becomes a breeding ground for anxiety, confusion, fear, and rumor. Economic pressures to resume normal operations are counteracted by fears that an environmental contaminant still exists. Once all physical explanations have been ruled out, investigators may turn to psychological explanations and focus on mass hysteria, but that explanation is primarily based on the absence of physical evidence rather than the presence of agreed-upon psychosocial conditions. Some reports suggest that the diagnosis of MPI is really an excuse for not conducting an adequate evaluation of low-level environmental contaminants. The disability in some workers is prolonged and points to non-work-related factors that may be contributing. Were it not for the unverifiable physical complaints and the workers' insistence that the symptoms are the result of physical disease and their concern about the complaints and their reactions to dismissal of their complaints, we would not consider these patients to have a mental disorder. These individuals are reinforced in their beliefs by some physicians and attorneys, and resultant litigation tends to fix their symptoms. In fact, a \"conspiracy theory\" evolves when there are enough convinced people--and enough people trying to dissuade them. Group phenomena reinforce their beliefs and make renouncement tantamount to betrayal. The mass psychogenic illness or psychiatric epidemic that occurs in the workplace offers an opportunity not only to study the elements of a biopsychosocial system, but also offers opportunities for medical anthropological studies that relate the causes and courses of specific episodes of MPI to the cultures of the individuals who develop symptoms and the cultures of the area in which the epidemic occurs.",

In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

      "title": "Evaluation and Comparison of the Effects of Time Perspective Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Narrative Therapy on Severity of Symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common disorder and due to its debilitating nature, it causes serious problems for the patient, and his/her family. Some of its repercussions are loss of self-confidence, disappointment, reduction in educational and professional performance, personal failure in social relationships. According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5), OCD is classified as a separate class of psychological disorders; while it has been classified under anxiety disorders in the DSM-IV. According to DSM-5, observance of both or each one of obsession and compulsion symptoms is enough to diagnose OCD. Obsession refers to an uncontrollable frequent mental image, thought, unwanted desire that cause uncomfortable condition to the patients. The patient is not able to stop thoughts such as fear of air pollution, harming others or oneself, and expression of natural/sexual immoral desires. OCD is the fourth most common psychological disorder and is also a clinical challenge. In recent years, several medical and psychological treatments have been conducted to treat the disorder (Sadok & Sadok, 2007). Behavioral approach and other effective ways to encounter and prevent OCD responses are the first treatment options that help controlling the symptoms to a great extent. Nevertheless, the notable achievement regarding treatment of the disorder is undeniable, there are still cases that have no or negligible response to the treatment. However, there are patients who cannot approbate encountering methods and don't execute homework or the tasks (Sookman & Steketee, 2010). Although CBT is successful in treating OCD, many researches have been conducted to find out other methods with more efficiency (Rees & Vankoesveld, 2008). One of these approaches is time perspective therapy, that is rooted in social psychology and it is extending to clinical and psychological fields. It has to do with the way that people connect their behavior with the past, present and future and at the same time mirroring viewpoints, beliefs, and values pertinent to time. It also takes time as a quasi-trait structure constituted of several aspects including past positive, past negative, present fatalist, and present hedonist, and the future. Time perspective therapy (TPT) is a novel treatment method based on time perspective theory (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). In general, psychological engagement with any time frames or loss of attention to a time framework appears to have to do with abnormal performance. As the theory implies, over past negative orientation, psychological engagement with negative experience, present fatalist orientation, or future negative are the strong indicators of psychological problems (Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof & Beekman, 2011). Boyd and Zimbardo (2005) made it clear that treatment or a healthy psychological performance is achieved by maintaining balance between the past, present, and the future. This balance might be a reflection of an individual's capabilities to learn from the past, compatibility with the present, and preparing to encounter with orientated behaviors for the future. There is a pool of information of using time perspective theory in many heath facilities; while there is paucity of clinical psychology and psychotherapy studies. The first work on the role of time perspective on committing suicide was carried out by Laghi, Baiocco, D'Alessio & Gurrieri (2009). Beek, Berghuis, Kerkhof and Beekman (2011) examined the relationship between time perspective, personality, and psychological pathology and concluded that subjects with higher past negative scores were more vulnerable to stress and psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. In addition, they found a relationship between lack of orientation to future in time perspective and depression/suicide thoughts. Furthermore, positive relationship was found between neurosis and past negative perspective. Zimbardo, Sword and Sword (2012) codified a 6-session treatment protocol based on TPT to reduce PTSD symptoms. …",

When improperly managed, the stress response may lead to a variety of medical, psychological and behavioral health problems. These problems range from cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug abuse, violence, and family conflict to insomnia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and ulcers. However, there are several stressful activities, including aerobic exercise, weight training, and flexibility training, which contribute to a number of health benefits.

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren.

Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen.

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "title": "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or more physical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met. Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis. As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws—a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")—could be recorded as \"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

Treatment of the underlying condition (in most cases a psychotic or mood disorder) has proved to be increasingly successful over time.Because of the possible co-occurrence of zoanthropy and alterations in coenesthesis, i.e. the sensation of physical existence, mental health workers should be on the lookout for cases of clinical zoanthropy in clinical practice and avoid treating them in the same way as they would treat other delusions.

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

By reviewing various epidemiological studies, relationships among some chronic diseases and depression have been noted. The depression-disease order of appearance can de bi-directional. It seems that stress, depression and inflammation have the capacity to affect the balance of cykotines produced by the immunological system. Modulation of the immunological system by the central nervous system is controIled/mediada by a complex bi-directional network composed of signals among the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the immunological system. The most frequent diseases related to depression are chronic but some are acute: of the central nervous system, endocrines, infections. Chronic pain also seems related to this problem. Pain, fatigue or tiredness are considered symptoms of a hidden depression and others, physical as well as psychiatric, could be algias, parestesias, headaches, vertigo, or gastrointestinal, cardio-respiratory neurodegenerative disorders.",

Objective To review and update the clinical characteristics, etiologies, pathophysiology and management of these headaches related to exertion. Methods In depth review of the publications, both in PubMed and in the main textbooks, of the different headaches induced by physical exercise. Results Cough, exercise and sexual headaches can be primary or secondary; therefore, complementary studies are mandatory to rule out structural lesions. However, clinical characteristics, such as an old age and response to indomethacin for cough headache or being a young male and response to beta-blockers for exercise and sexual headaches, plus a normal examination are suggestive of a primary etiology. Etiology for secondary varieties, as posterior fossa lesions for cough headache or vascular malformations for exercise and sexual headaches, are also different. Finally, headache as a distant manifestation of myocardial ischemia, also known as “cardiac cephalalgia”, appears at exertion in around two-thirds of cases and typically lasts less than 30 minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerine. Conclusions Primary and secondary cough headache can usually be suspected based on clinical characteristics and separated from exercise and sexual headaches, which share many aspects. Cardiac cephalalgia is not necessarily an exertional headache and should be considered in adult patients with short lasting headaches and patent vascular risk factors.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "abstract": "Summary Chronic pain syndrome is a major health and socioeconomic problem that is manifested by frequent asking of medical assistance, high price of health care, sick leave, work inability and disability as well as frequent compensation requests. Generally speaking, pain, especially chronic pain, significantly diminishes the patient and their family’s quality of life. Most people experience one or more pain disorders during their life. Chronic pain prevalence accounts for 15 to 22% in population. It occurs more frequently in women, in older age and persons of decreased socioeconomic status. Chronic pain can be causally linked to comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as fear of physical illness, constant worry, anxious disorders, depression and reaction to stress. Every pain, especially chronic, has psychological characteristics as well which are expressed to an extent. When the pathophysiologic factor is known, the pain is conventionally classified as “specific” and when it is unknown it is called “nonspecific”, psychogenic, idiopathic, conversive or euphemistic atypical pain. Nonspecific pain is very often a symptom of a psychiatric disorder or it is classified in the group of soma toform psychiatric disorders according to contemporary classification systems, e.g. the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-IV and the International Classification of Di seases (ICD-10). Psychosomatic medicine studies the connection of psychological conditions and psychiatric disorders, psychosocial stress, family and occupational factors with somatic disorders. On the other hand, a painful somatic illness can cause anxiety, depression, social phobia and isolation. Treating nonspecific psychogenic pain disorder is not possible without a holistic, integrative, interdisciplinary team approach of psychiatrists, psychologists, physiologists, neurologists and sometimes even neurosurgeons.

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is defined as a preoccupation with an \"imagined\" defect in one's appearance. Alternatively, where there is a slight physical anomaly, then the person's concern is markedly excessive. The preoccupation is associated with many time consuming rituals such as mirror gazing or constant comparing. BDD patients have a distorted body image, which may be associated with bullying or abuse during childhood or adolescence. Such patients have a poor quality of life, are socially isolated, depressed, and at high risk of committing suicide. They often have needless dermatological treatment and cosmetic surgery. The condition is easily trivialised and stigmatised. There is evidence for the benefit of cognitive behaviour therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in high doses for at least 12 weeks, as in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no evidence of any benefit of antipsychotic drugs or other forms of psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "A study about the problem of stress in physician who work in intensive care units requires a previous reflection about the stress concept itself. Selye's conception undoubtedly signified a great progress for the comprehension of the processes of biological adaptation, but it seems it can not be easily applied to the psychological and social field. The decrease of psychosomatic diseases during the last world war is one of the many examples that make question the causal relationship between stress and disease. The concept of life event in anglo-saxon psychiatry is also discussed, as well as its attempt to measure the stressor character of these circumstances through a scale of points. The concept of \"pathogenic situation\" of German psychiatry is proposed in exchange. From this perspective, medicine in general and intensive medicine in particular can be seen as human activities constituting \"pathogenic situations\" for the ones who exercise them. The corresponding literature allows to establish that medicine generates more pathology in physicians than other professions, but intensive medicine does not seem to be more pathogenic than other specialties. The elements of the \"medical act\" which could be responsible for the stress or pathogenic situation are studied. Respecting intensive medicine, two are the characteristics which seem to contribute to make it \"pathogenic\" for those who exercise it: a mistaken vision of death as an \"enemy\" which has to be fought à outrance, and the \"temporality of urgency\", proper to an ICU, which makes that the doctor can not give himself time enough for listening to the patient and telling him the adequate word of consolation.",

Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

This chapter also discusses how to differentiate BDD from normal appearance concerns and from problematic preoccupation with obvious physical defects. BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as another mental disorder. Sometimes misdiagnosis occurs because patients are too embarrassed and ashamed to reveal their appearance concerns; in such cases, BDD symptoms that are more readily observable (such as social anxiety) may be assigned an incorrect diagnosis while BDD goes undetected. In other cases, BDD symptoms are recognized but are misdiagnosed as another disorder. BDD must be differentiated from other conditions so appropriate treatment can be instituted.",

To the emotional unrest caused by these vestiges of ancient taboos may be added disturbances of the female reproductive organs that are caused by other emotional conflicts. In psychosomatic illness, the patient is a victim of some emotional conflict of which she is unaware. Her symptoms are real, but the causes are elusive. Because she is disturbed, she consults a physician in an effort to discover an organic basis for her symptoms. Menstrual disturbances; vague, low, abdominal pain; intramenstrual cramping; headache, nausea, vomiting; palpitation, loose stools, and urinary frequency may be associated with emotional conflicts. Marital problems may be the causative factor, or may intensify gynecological conditions. Sexual maladjustment may cause a woman to be frigid or to have dyspareunia. Menstrual disturbances may be the only manifestation of her unhappiness. Some physicians believe that emotional conflicts may play an important part in sterility. A patient who consults her physician because of symptoms for which no physical basis may be found needs as much sympathy and understanding as does the patient with demonstrable physical pathology. Her pains and aches, troubles and miseries, discontents and disappointments are very real to her; she must not simply be classed as neurotic, ignored when she lists her complaints, or rushed through her examination and consultation with the physician. The nurse's understanding will be of great comfort to this patient and perhaps will even be a factor in helping her get well.",

Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

      "abstract": "Environmental threats to mental equity have recently gained much attention in the sphere of public and curative health due to their toll on the individual, families, the public, and their economic sphere. Mental health or soundness of mind is important at every stage of life from childhood and adolescence through adulthood to protect the brain from environmental stress. What makes mental health unlike genetic rare disorders is that there is no known single cause for this rising public health issue because it arises from multiple factors. These factors include early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse either because of child abuse, sexual assault or seeing any form of violence, experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, biological factors or chemical exposure resulting in hormonal imbalances in the brain, and to a large extent having feelings of loneliness or isolation leading to suicidal action. Furthermore, the increase in mental health and its accompanying conditions depend on environmental with or without behavioral changes due to genetic stability may be associated with drug, alcohol, or substance abuse which is associated with the brain reward circuit which may need to compromise the neural circuit over a wide range of stressors on the human body interacting with the sequential neuronal cell cascade. Although humoral networking is associated with socio-behavioral change, work through family, religious, organizational engagement, and community support play major roles in its solution and management, it is consensually accepted that defining key determinants underlying molecular network altering by epigenetic and genetic factors have promise in empowering future systematic health and personal care including surveillance, prevention, treatment, and monitoring process. In the modern global and urbanization era, emerging new biomedical technological advances such as epigenetic tools, genomics editing, human genomics study utilizing sequencing technology, and reverse genetic resources from worm to animal models have enabled us to take a closer look at mechanisms that could be involved in mental illness and drug abuse or addiction using a pattern of metabolomics and its connectivity reflecting the interplay between mental illness and drug abuse and/or addiction. This paper describes a molecular-driven surveillance platform as a part of the power of prevention to care of populational health which could be beneficial by predicting risk and unfolding the impact of daily lifestyle on human behavior such as food intake, alcohol intoxication, and its outcome likely the effect of metabolism on mental illness and drug abuse. Interaction between environmental cues to neural circuits which may interplay with metabolic networks as well as potential risk resulting in various forms of phenotypic complications and behavioral alteration might be detectable using multi-omics platforms.",

      "abstract": "Physical illness is a frequent event in everyone's life and in most cases has no particular effect on the psychological structure of the individual. However in the case of serious chronic or disabling illnesses or those occurring at a delicate stage in psychological development, the repercussions may assume social practical, affective and existential dimensions. In its human dimension, illness represents a double existential breakdown, severing links with environment and body that typify a healthy man's existence. This breakdown gives rise to a certain number of painful feelings, mainly of anxiety in acute illness, mainly depressive in chronic illnes, in which the collapse of self-esteem and the compromised self-image appear to be definitive. Such feelings, partly connected directly to the illness and partly caused by the conflicts arising from that condition, in their turn activate a series of mechanisms and defensive behaviour patterns which explain certain incomprehensible attitudes often noted by doctors in their patients and which often hinder treatment.",

      "abstract": "There are many patients with chronic pain who are referred from each of the clinical fields to the department of psychosomatic medicine. Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

Patients complain of pain described as burning, associated with sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor and/or trophic disorders. The pain appears disproportionate to the initial lesion. The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances. The natural evolution is rather favourable.Le syndrome douloureux régional complexe constitue une entité clinique survenant habituellement suite à un traumatisme, une chirurgie ou un autre événement déclencheur.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is an extremely disabling symptom both in healthy people and in various diseases. Physical fatigue is characterized by limitations in physical functioning, while mental/cognitive fatigue involves difficulties in concentrating and performing cognitive tasks. Mental and physical fatigue exist in both pathological and physiological fatigue. Fatigue is primarily an adaptive physiological process. It is a signal to have a rest and helps conserve energy to prevent injury, which can be useful after intense work, or when the body’s defenses need to be redistributed, for example, during infectious disease. It is important to distinguish between fatigue or tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome in clinical practice. Chronic fatigue syndrome has multisystem manifestations and affects millions of people globally. Although the exact aetiology of chronic fatigue syndrome is uncertain, the studies point to neurological, immunological, autonomic and energy disorders. The main sings of chronic fatigue syndrome are debilitating fatigue that is worsened by activity, poor exercise tolerance, unrefreshing sleep and cognitive impairment. Reduced information processing speed is the most common cognitive impairment in chronic fatigue syndrome. Other manifestations include decreased reaction time, working memory, and attention. These symptoms must persist for at least 3–6 months for a diagnosis to be made. As there are no specific tests for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis can be established on the basis of a medical history and physical examination. Although there are no standards-based methods specific to chronic fatigue syndrome, clinicians can reduce the severity of symptoms using pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment approaches that have proved their efficacy in clinical practice. In particular, nootropics are widely used in asthenic conditions and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fonturacetam is a nootropic drug that directly activates brain integration activities, promotes memory consolidation, and improves concentration and mental activity.",

      "abstract": "In cases of traumatic brain injuries in children it may be difficult to differentiate between physical abuse and accidental occurrence. This review will shed light on discriminating epidemiological as well as biomechanical data, morphological findings, and clinical features. As a basic principle, simple injuries are caused by simple mechanisms like falls whereas life-threatening injuries should be attributed to abuse until proven otherwise. Implausibilities between reported events and mechanisms by caregivers as well as more than one explanation of injury indicate suspicion of child abuse. From reviewing the literature, it can be stated that falls from less than 1.5 m lead only in few cases to severe brain injuries. Children who experienced a fall at home seldom exhibit fractures of the skull but just minor intracranial injuries without neurological deficits. Regarding biomechanical aspects, multiple or complex skull fractures, depression fractures, additional fractures of the body, and intracranial hemorrhages as a consequence of an impact are the most important findings in child abuse. Moreover, additional specific morphological criteria give evidence of clinical and/or post-mortem diagnosis of the shaken baby syndrome. These include subdural hemorrhage and laceration of the brain and retinal bleeding, epidural hemorrhage of the cervical cord, gripping marks (bruises) on chest and/or shoulders, and tearing injuries of the throat and neck muscles. Post-mortem signs of recurrent shaken baby syndrome are indicated by iron-positive cells or microglial cells in neuronal or retinal tissue. A clinical diagnosis will be dependent on the one hand on the exclusion of coagulation diseases, on the other hand on the demonstration of a subdural hemorrhage by means of neuroimaging techniques, i.e., CT and MRI, as well as retinal hemorrhage. The shaken baby syndrome will usually be observed within the first year of life. The doctor has to manifest his diagnosis to the caregivers and - before informing the caregivers - he must be sure of his diagnosis.",

However, other problems reflect philosophical positions ranging from those based on the premise that primary depression does not fit the medical model and therefore is not a \"disease\" that can be modeled, to those holding that the emotional state of depression is so uniquely human that subhuman organisms cannot be used in its analysis. In evaluating animal models of any human disorder or condition, it is crucial for those using the models to keep abreast of developments and advances in the relevant clinical knowledge concerning the particular condition being studied. This is especially important for such disorders as essential hypertension or major depression where the central causative factors are not yet known, but where extensive clinical investigation is constantly expanding knowledge of the patients' condition.",

On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

The central position is taken by all-the-time present intense irrational fear. Alcoholism, misuse of sedatives, depression, and panic with agoraphobia, OCD are common followers of social phobia. Differential diagnosis witch eliminates panic with agoraphobia, or just the lack of social skills allows the right therapeutic approach. Conclusion Social phobia, alone or combined with other disorders, has a huge medical and social value. Coming back to regular life tracks depends on the right diagnosis and the right time to go into the healing process.

Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

Stress factors in elderly have their particularity. Anxiety states in elderly can develop in response to factors that wouldn’t cause mental disorders in a young persons. The most common chronic factors in elderly are lonely dwelling, change of life conditions and financial losses, diminished capacity of self-serving, helplessness and living in dependence of other people because of somatic diseases. Among acute stress factors could be mentioned on interrupted association with relatives, moving to a new place, had planned hospitalization and surgical treatment. Clinical picture of mixed anxiety and depressive disorder in elderly has its particularity. It is characterized by impairment of emotional and will functions expressed in depressive mood, fear, anxiety assessment of future. These factors lead to forming pathological motivation of behavior, accompanied by feeling of helplessness, uncertainty in abilities. Cognitive functions are also disturbed, especially in case of comorbide organic emotionally labile disorder of vascular genesis. In such cases symptoms of both disorders enforce each other. Firstly, attentive functions are disturbed because of fixation on unreal problems, connected with anxiety apprehensions. Voluntary memory is also reduced, especially on recent events. Although mixed anxiety and depressive disorder has a mild level of severity, it is accompanied with disturbance of critical functions. It has a great influence on persons’ capacity to make decisions and on level of social functioning.",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

Some patients present with persistent and disabling fatigue, but show no abnormalities on physical examination or screening laboratory tests. In these cases, the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered. CFS is characterized by debilitating fatigue with associated myalgias, tender lymph nodes, arthralgias, chills, feverish feelings, and postexertional malaise. Diagnosis of CFS is primarily by exclusion with no definitive laboratory test or physical findings. Medical research continues to examine the many possible etiologic agents for CFS (infectious, immunologic, neurologic, and psychiatric), but the answer remains elusive. It is known that CFS is a heterogeneous disorder possibly involving an interaction of biologic systems. Similarities with fibromyalgia exist and concomitant illnesses include irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and headaches. Therefore, treatment of CFS may be variable and should be tailored to each patient. Therapy should include exercise, diet, good sleep hygiene, antidepressants, and other medications, depending on the patient's presentation.",

Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric illness in epilepsy, but emerging evidence is providing a more complete and clearer elucidation of the problem. Clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with quality of life than does the seizure rate. In fact, depression is second only to medication toxicity as the clinical factor that explains the greatest variance in quality of life. Only a small number of studies have investigated the plausible neurobiological mechanisms of depression in epilepsy, but preliminary data suggest that underlying brain dysfunction may be a more important predictor than vocational or social disability. Furthermore, specific aspects of hippocampal dysfunction may be a causal factor in the genesis and maintenance of depression in temporal lobe epilepsy. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management are expected to become available in the near future.",

This condition can go unrecognized for years, as most physicians assume that descriptions of medical symptoms are presented in good faith. Variations have sometimes been termed factitious disorder imposed on another or Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The secretive and sometimes criminal nature of these behaviors provides numerous barriers to research, but important data have been collected.

      "abstract": "The essential feature of functional somatic syndromes is the presence of symptoms without medical explanation. the syndromes have a high psychiatric co-morbidity, and stress and anxiety are assumed to play a role, at least in the maintenance of the complaints. Psychophysiological models traditionally attribute the symptoms to stress or anxiety-related disregulations in specific physiological mechanisms. In fact, however, there is no convincing empirical proof for such models. The idea of a direct coupling between self-reported symptoms and corresponding physiological disregulations thus seems hardly tenable. Therefore, we propose a reformulation of the potential role of stress physiology in diagnosing functional somatic symptoms. Physiological measures should not be used anymore to demonstrate explanatory physiological disregulations. They should instead be used to provide additional information about the state of activity of the central fear network . This alternative approach is based on the fact that self-reported and physiological manifestations of an emotional state are only loosely coupled, making both aspects complementary indicators of the brain activity involved. Physiological measures may thus provide additional information (above self-report) regarding emotional states implicated in functional complaints. A suggested application of this approach is to define sub-groups of functional somatic patients on the basis of similarities in disregulated physiological stress-response profiles. This in future may contribute to the development of more specific diagnostic tools and better tailored treatments.",

This is due, in part, to the fact that the patient’s complaint is a symptom, not a clinical sign or diagnosis, and the anatomical substrates for causing the problem are myriad (Fig. 16.1). The etiologies are diverse, if not legion, and there is poor correlation with symptoms, laboratory study findings, and pathological findings. This accounts for the fact that in 85% of patients with acute low-back pain and in 50% of patients with chronic low-back pain, no diagnosis is ever established.64,156,209 Further the problem may be complicated by other factors, resulting in an exaggeration of symptoms by nonphysiological processes (psychological, remunerative, occupational, etc.).",

      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with bodily symptoms and complaints that are not sufficiently explained by organic pathology or well known pathophysiological mechanisms present a major challenge to any health delivery system. From a perspective of psychiatric classification these medically unexplained somatic symptoms may be diagnosed as primary psychiatric disorders such as depressive and anxiety disorders on the one hand, as somatoform disorders on the other. Among medical specialties a separate diagnostic approach is taken to conceptualize functional somatic syndromes. Unfortunately, both diagnostic systems do not conform to each other very well. The concept of somatoform disorders as outlined in DSM-III to DSM-IV-TR and in ICD-10 refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders with prominent somatic symptoms or special body-focussed anxieties, or convictions of illness. These disorders seem to indicate medical conditions that cannot, however, fully be explained either in terms of medical diagnostics or of other primary psychiatric disorders. There is one major conceptual assumption that postulates a decisive impact of psychosocial stress on the origin, onset and/or course of these somatic symptoms and complaints. And there is one major path of diagnostic steps to be taken, i.e. just to count the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms, to determine their reference to any main organ system, to prove that they are not self-induced, to put special stress on prevailing pain symptoms and to separately assess dominant health anxieties or illness convictions. Since introduction of the diagnostic concept of somatoform disorders there have been arising many critical issues regarding the soundness of this diagnostic category. These issues, among other things, refer to a problematic mind-body dichotomy overemphasizing psychosocial and psychological factors and neglecting major neurobiological processes, to the impracticable criterion of “medically unexplained”, to the demand of conceptual clarity and coherence of this diagnostic category, to the rather trivial diagnostic procedure of just counting the number of medically unexplained somatic symptoms whereas not assessing typical dimensions of illness behaviour in a corresponding way, to the major overlap between subgroups of somatoform disorders on the one hand and factitious disorders, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders on the other, to a principal focus on the epidemiologically rare condition of somatisation disorder as core disorder thereby undervaluing much more prevalent subthreshold conditions, to the difficult communication of the whole diagnostic group to medical colleagues dealing with the same problems by using a different conceptual approach, however. These critical issues surrounding the concept of somatoform disorder will be reflected in respect of some major revisions projected in future diagnostic classification systems of DSM-V and ICD-11.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

There are only individual patients complaining after injury to the head of headache, dizziness, fatigue, irritability, \"nervousness,\" impaired efficiency or other mental symptoms.

      "abstract": "Generally the term stress refers to experiences of endangering one’s physical or psy­chological wellbeing. Physiological stress refers to bodily adaptation processes and the maintenance of body’s balance. Selye defined stress as a function of elevated corticosteroid levels and used the term stress to refer to the effects of any agent that threatens the homeostasis of the organism. The term allostasis which refers to the body’s ability to achieve stability. The allostatic load is assumed to be caused by frequent stress, lack of adaptation to repeated stress, and inability to shut down the allostatic response when the stress is over and inadequate response or dysfunction of the stress systems  Thus, psychological stress can be defined as a discrepancy between personal capacities and environmental demands. Somatic stress symptoms are related to both physiological and psychological stress. The different types of stressors are likely to elicit divergent stress reactions. The multifaceted nature of stress and various sources of stress must also be taken into account. It is important to define the stress precisely in epidemiological studies. Consequently, stress has been determined here in terms of stressful life events, experience of chronic stress, experimentally induced mental and physiological stress reactions and work stress. The work stress models that are presented here have been used extensively in studies of occupational and cardiovascular health. The inheritance of stress refers here to an innate temperament. Rationale is as follows: temperament a) has a biological basis, b) is highly inherited, and c) explains what one experiences as a stress and partly determines what the health consequences are. The common assumption in several temperament theories is that temperament plays important role in moderating stress. In the end we presented the comparative analysis between the eustress and distress.",

The phenomenon of becoming ill on weekends and/or during vacation has been termed \"leisure sickness\". Attempts to understand this problem can be found in the current literature. Vacation for the wrong motivations or a mismatch between leisure activity and personality are some of the reasons. Other reports show associations between similar health-affecting patterns and personality traits or increased stress, but these factors have not been directly linked to leisure sickness before. Indeed, leisure sickness is not a specific defined illness yet but is more an accumulation of different symptoms that lead to indisposition. If leisure sickness is not only a phenomenon but is actually a real illness, it is seriously preventing people from the benefits of leisure time on the one hand and directly affects vacation experience with respect to destination, hotel and other tourism products on the other hand. Therefore, leisure sickness deserves further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

      "abstract": "Mental stress in humans, on the face of it, is the perception of unease, of various degrees, in response to stressors, such as, threats, emotional, economic, socioeconomic and political instabilities, and other conditionssome due to geopolitical conditions and some emblematic of modern timeswhich create intense and/or difficult brain engagements. However, since such perception, besides serving as the alarm phase, could also be indicative of other, and often adverse, physiological effects, it has been the subject of much research since the early decades of last century [1-5]. These efforts, which have resulted in a vast body of the very valuable scientific findings, revolve around the physiological processes that stressors prompt in the biologic system; and how they affect its equilibrium, i.e., its homeostasis. But how the physiological processes are triggered through involvement of sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as other systemsthe underlying cause of what can be considered the over-drive engagements of these systemshas seemingly escaped scientific scrutiny and remains unanswered; perhaps because it does not have much bearing on the medical treatments of the ensuing effects of sustained (chronic) stress sensation, and also mainly because much about the details of brain processing of sensory data has not been clearly figured out, though the role of the brain in perception of the world, and life as a whole, has been widely recognized since the enlightenment era; early 17th century. However progress, in last few decades, in understanding modus operandi of the brain, has led to further recognition of the fact that much of the brain operations are computational in nature: It is inferred that brain, and the rest of the nervous system, comprise extensive computational machinery that process all sense-relayed information; using its innate (evolutionary-formulated) instructions, imbedded in its constructs (as patterns), for analyzing events and creating perceptions. In the context of such idealization of the operation of the brain [6], this work is an attempt to throw some light on the puzzle of stress; suggesting a mechanism for creation of its sensation, and the prompting of the physiologic effects.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder: Common, Severe and in Need of Treatment Research",
      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

      "title": "Stressing out, or outing stress?",
      "abstract": "Stress is an unavoidable component of our working life. How we deal with it may have profound consequences for our job satisfaction, our health and the standard of care we are able to give our patients [1]. Any stressful event will elicit a characteristic physiological response consisting of autonomic stimulation and heightened arousal, which will then persist to some degree for the duration of the stressful stimulus. During an acutely stressful event, such as an intraoperative critical incident, this 'fight or flight' reaction may directly contribute to the resolution of the stressful event. On the other hand, because chronic occupational stresses such as poor working conditions or extended hours are seldom amenable to rapid resolution, the fight or flight reaction in these circumstances may be both inappropriate and ineffective. Our ability to tolerate stress is the result of a complicated interaction of inconstant factors. These include our own personality and coping skills, our current levels of fatigue, distraction or frustration, our experience of previous stressors, the strength of our social or occupational support and, not least, the nature of the stressor itself. However, a fundamental component is our individual 'locus of control' [2]. This term describes our belief in our ability to influence events around us, individuals who believe they have this ability having an 'internal' locus, in contrast to those with an 'external' locus who place more emphasis on the role of chance. Individuals with an internal locus of control tend to report less occupational stress than those without it [3]. Recent studies of occupational stress in nurses have demonstrated the complex relation between the perception of stress and the character of the individual. In a study comparing occupational stress between intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and non-ICU nurses, the ICU nurses found that their ICU nursing activities were less stressful than non-ICU nurses found their non-ICU nursing tasks to be [4]. The authors concluded that ICU nurses had maximized their job satisfaction, and minimized their occupational stress, by selecting a speciality that offered them the high degree of personal autonomy and job complexity which they required for personal fulfilment. In a separate study, when ICU nurses were asked to specify the most stressful aspect of being an ICU patient they selected items relating to loss of personal control significantly more frequently than ICU patients did when given the same questionnaire [5]. The association of a preference for working in a stressful environment, a strong need for personal autonomy and an internal locus of control has been described as 'Type A' behaviour [6]. This rather loose term also includes characteristics such as self-confidence and a strong work commitment, a preference to work alone when under pressure and an urgent sense of time pressure. Type A behaviour is observed more frequently in doctors than in other health professionals, and is associated with a high level of job satisfaction, a low perception of occupational stress and a low requirement for sick leave [2]. Although the prevalence of Type A behaviour in different medical specialities has not been studied, it is likely that doctors who have chosen a speciality in which they usually work alone, and in an environment over which they can exert a high degree of personal control, might be expected to display marked Type A behaviour patterns. Many anaesthetists and intensivists will recognize this as a description of their own working practice. If Type A behaviour offers a degree of protection against the consequences of choosing a profession with a high exposure to occupational stress [3], and if doctors in general, and anaesthetists in particular, display a high prevalence of this behaviour, is there any need to be concerned about our exposure to stress in the workplace? The obverse to the high-achieving behaviour of the Type A individual is their tendency to suppress symptoms of fatigue, and sacrifice their own and their family's social needs, to their pursuit of a successful career [6]. This is exemplified by the results of a survey of occupational stress in health professionals, which demonstrated that doctors made less use of coping strategies such as social support, and were less able to separate home and work, than almost any other group [2]. It has even been suggested that health workers have a particular susceptibility to occupational stress because of the emotional stresses to which they are exposed [7], particularly if they have not been trained to deal with these aspects of their work [8]. Occupational stress is usually beyond the individual's control, and is therefore exactly the form of stress with which competitive, achievement-orientated Type A individuals are least able to deal [3]. In the face of such stressors, individuals may adopt coping strategies such as denial or rationalization which, whilst providing apparent short-term relief, actually perpetuate the individual's exposure to the stressor. Furthermore, although decreasing the individual's emotional involvement in a stressful situation may be helpful in the short-term, in the face of continued exposure these coping mechanisms can lead to a growing sense of detachment and cynicism, impairing the health professional's ability to emphathize with their patient, and resulting in a progressive reduction in job satisfaction. If their home and work environment are already poorly separated, the emotional detachment is likely to extend into the individual's home life, and slowly erode the support it previously offered [9]. In the long term, this will increase the doctor's vulnerability to prolonged stress and lead to social isolation, professional over-involvement, emotional exhaustion and 'burn out' [2]. Finally, the sustained fight or flight response elicited by continued exposure to the stressor may itself present a significant threat to the doctor's own health, through an increased risk of cardiovascular or infectious disease, as well as depression, anxiety and excessive alcohol consumption [10-12]. Another, more recent, factor adds a potent source of stress to this fragile structure. The protective effect of an internal locus of control on the perception of occupational stress is diminished if the individual feels they have lost control of the stressor. The recent organizational changes to the delivery of health care in many developed countries, with the consequent reduction in doctors' autonomy, poses exactly this risk. A recent study has confirmed an increase in the level of occupational stress, and a fall in morale, amongst doctors as a consequence of these changes [13]. These changes illustrate the challenge that is facing the profession. As doctors, we have chosen to work in a highly competitive, achievement-orientated environment. As anaesthetists and intensivists, we have selected a speciality in which our high degree of personal autonomy, and our control over our environment, contribute to our job satisfaction. Yet, as individuals, we are faced with a growing burden of occupational stressors that fall outside our control, and with which we are poorly equipped to deal. Since we are unlikely to be able to reduce our exposure to these stresses significantly, we should take steps to improve our ability to deal with them. The first of these steps is to acknowledge our exposure to stresses beyond our control. The observations on doctors' behaviour through the centuries suggest that we are not good at conceding our own vulnerability and that, as care givers, we make poor recipients. This should not be a point of pride. Second, we need to accept that not only are we probably not as good at dealing with these stresses as we might like to believe, but also that they may compromise both our health and the health and happiness of our families. Finally, we have to equip the next generation of doctors with the skills they will need to meet the roles they will encounter in the course of their careers. This does not simply mean training doctors to deal with identifiable stresses such as starting a new job [8], comforting the bereaved [14] or managing the department [15], although this is important. We also need to develop a working environment in which we have the skills to support our juniors and the expectation that our colleagues will support us. Clearly this cannot be imposed by management directive. Rather it is the responsibility of us all to learn how to provide support to our colleagues, and to encourage them to support us. Stress, like mortality, involves us all, and denial is no cure. C. E. Granger Blackpool M. P. Shelly Manchester",

Because trauma is so common in medical practice, in the form of accidents, severe illness, and sometimes medical and surgical treatments, these disorders are commonly seen by physicians. An initial severe reaction to a traumatic event such as severe accident is an acute stress disorder and is commonly characterized by dissociation. A more long-lasting emotional reaction to ongoing stress such as a new diagnosis of life-threatening illness is termed an adjustment disorder. An often longer-lasting and more severe psychological reaction associated with repeated mental re-experiencing of the traumatic event is called post-traumatic stress disorder. These trauma-related disorders are not only an important cause of suffering but may also complicate medical care, hence they require recognition and appropriate treatment.",

Clinical correlates of post-stroke depression include severity of physical and cognitive impairment as well as location of brain injury. Perhaps the most compelling reason to identify post-stroke depression, however, is its substantial impact on recovery in activities of daily living, cognitive function, and survival. Antidepressant medication has been shown to effectively treat depression, although its administration may require careful clinical monitoring. Other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders include mania, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, apathy, and pathological crying. Controlled studies have not documented the effect of these disorders on long-term recovery, but the potential impact of syndromes such as mania and apathy on rehabilitation efforts or pathological crying on social functioning are evident. With the exception of pathological crying, which has been shown to respond to antidepressant drug therapy, the other post-stroke emotional/behavioral disorders need to be evaluated in controlled treatment trials for response to therapy.",

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

HSS may produce pain in the legs, numbness, syncope, and has been the subject of debate without much clinical data to support the physiologic explanation for these clinical features. HSS has been reported loosely in peer-reviewed literature. Further, one's predisposition of developing HSS, or subsequent medical ramifications requiring therapy has not been well evaluated. Our knowledge of HSS to this point has been derived mostly from expert opinion and case reports over the last 50 years. A rise in manufacturer development of fall protection equipment, including the use of harnesses, has resulted in increased regulative preventative measures, rescue techniques, and postulations for medical care. Other syndromes have been associated with the effects of HSS, but the constellation of symptoms reported for HSS are inconsistent with any other set of well- established existing medical syndromes, leaving a gap in understanding of the overall etiology and pathogenesis of HSS. This review aims to examine possible factors that may help qualify or quantify a series of measurable signs or symptoms that may establish HSS as its own syndrome, or if pre-dispositional factors may play a role that could be of clinical or practical use.",

Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same substance could be analyzed in a subpopulation of participants (i.e., with the same illness).\r\nRelevance to Nursing\r\nFatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in individuals who have cancer and also is highly prevalent in populations with progressive life-threatening conditions. Fatigue presents a challenge for healthcare professionals because it can be nonspecific to treatment or illness, ongoing, subjective, and disabling to patients. In addition, the actual causes of fatigue are difficult to isolate, particularly in the person who is receiving palliative care because the symptom usually overlaps with concurrent disease-related problems such as malnutrition, sleep disturbances, pain, depression, asthenia, infections, and anemia. No consensus exists on the definition of fatigue or a standardized method of assessment. The working diagnosis used for the purpose of this review was “fatigue is a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy” (Radbruch et al., 2008, p. 15).\r\nIn the context of palliative and advanced disease, fatigue can be viewed as an inevitable characteristic of the last phase of life. However, several pharmacologic treatments have been studied in an attempt to reduce the severity of the symptom and thereby improve the overall quality of life. Knowledge of effective medical treatments will be of particular interest to nurses who care for patients who frequently experience debilitating fatigue.",

It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image.

This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3.

It is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, accounting for approximately one quarter of general practice consultations and half of all outpatient attendances and hospital admissions in the UK (Royal College of Physicians, 1996). For some people, persistent pain is an unrelieved condition of daily life. Yet despite the prevalence of chronic and debilitating conditions, indices of social well-being seldom include pain as a factor affecting the quality of life. Pain is commonly seen as a symptom of other complaints rather than an adversity in itself. Although injury and disease can be detected by observation and clinical tests, pain is a peculiarly private experience that cannot be reduced to anything else; it cannot be x-rayed, or calibrated like blood pressure on a standardized scale, nor can we feel another's pain. Unlike most other states of consciousness, pain has no object or referential content: it is not of anything or for anything, nor can it be easily defined. We commonly resort to suggestive metaphors to describe what we feel in terms of something else — as a 'shooting', 'burning', 'throbbing', 'gnawing' sensation. Sometimes the sheer intensity of what we feel seems to defy language and we can only speak of 'excruciating', 'unbearable' or 'indescribable' pain.KeywordsChronic PainPersistent PainDiscursive PracticeMedical DiscourseReal BodyThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

Muscle tension, wringing of hands, weeping and moaning, repeating over and over in a monotonous and stereotyped way phrases expressive of misery are all important clinical signs of major depression. Similarly tachycardia, dry tongue/mouth, sweaty palms and/or bodily extremities, cold clammy skin, pallor, pupillary dilatation, tremor, and the fluctuations in blood pressure with wide pulse pressure are all important and give away the underlying distress. These signs have formed an integral part of both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale as they have a positive correlation with the diagnosis and the severity of illness. Current practice of operational criteria does not help exclude patients with subjective perception of distress and also fails to make room for aetiopathogenesis. The DSM-IV does not include these physical signs as an integral part of the clinical picture of depression, consequently leaving the diagnosis of MDE to subjective criteria and perceptions. This could also explain a large placebo response in recent randomised controlled clinical trials.",

      "title": "Stress and Insomnia – A Vicious Circle",
      "abstract": "Insomnia refers to the complaint of experiencing unsatisfactory sleep, typically characterized by difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Individuals with insomnia are dissatisfied with their sleep quality and perceive it as hindering their ability to perform well in work, school, and social settings. Common symptoms of insomnia include fatigue, decreased mood,irritability, general discomfort, and cognitive difficulties. Stress, on the other hand, is the result of emotional or physical tension triggered by various events that can lead a person to feel frustrated, angry, or anxious. Stress is the body&amp;#39;s response to a challenge or demand, and it is accompanied by the release of hormones. The specific physiological response to stressdepends on factors such as the type of stress, the individual's characteristics, their neuroendocrine system, and the combination of these elements, which collectively determine how the brain and body react to a particular stressor. The activation of the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a response mechanism triggered by stress. Disturbed sleep, particularly insomnia, is a common side effect of stress, varying in intensity. Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being, making the physiological connections between sleep and stress vital in understanding the development of stress-induced pathophysiology. Current treatments for insomnia include Cognitive BehavioralTherapy, improving sleep hygiene, and employing psychological and pharmacological interventions. However, these approaches primarily aim to improve insomnia symptoms rather than addressing its underlying cause. In the context of Homoeopathy, the concept of constitution refers to an individual's unique structure, composition, nature, and physicalmakeup, influenced by both inherited qualities and environmental factors. Therefore, it is essential to individualize each case and administer a similimum remedy to achieve complete healing according to Homoeopathic principles. This review aims to explore the physiological and neuroendocrine changes that occur as a result of the interplay between stress and thedevelopment of insomnia.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "[Induced abortion: shock and after-effects?].",
      "abstract": "It is generally agreed that the incidence of serious psychic side effects after abortion is very low. Most women undergoing abortion appear to experience nothing more than temporary depression that spontaneously resolves, and some surveys suggest that the psychic state may be improved under some circumstances after abortion. A minority of women, however, suffer considerably after abortion and their experiences, as elsewhere in psychopathology, shed light on the less obvious experience of other women. The author uses case studies to illuminate the dynamic and subconscious effects of abortion, which are revealed in attitudes, symptoms, or comments. Whether or not a woman seeks an abortion, the very fact of carrying an unwanted child can be enough to provoke psychic symptoms. If the partner abandons the woman because of her pregnancy, the blow may be even more strongly felt, resulting in a mixture of pain and aggression. The symptoms and the connection with a past abortion may remain unrecognized until a subsequent, desired pregnancy. Symptoms after an abortion may include frigidity, vaginismus, dyspareunia, pain, or poor tolerance of contraception desired at the conscious level. The manifestations are not specific and may occur after childbirth or at any other time. No matter how well accepted abortion seems to be by society, it is different from any other surgical procedure and it may therefore have some aftereffects. Social acceptance may provide some comfort but it is not enough to compensate for personal conflicts. Sometimes the conflict is expressed in the sexual relationship with the partner, who is considered responsible for the abortion. The effects of an abortion on a relationship depend in part of how satisfactory the relationship was before the pregnancy. Repeated requests for abortion may result from a woman's intrapsychic conflicts. It is well known that the desire to be pregnant is not always accompanied by a desire for motherhood. Pregnancy may be an expression of narcissistic need or a means of defense against feelings of unworthiness or doubts about identity. Guilt feelings may be increased by ambivalence about the abortion, by religious beliefs, or even by the desire for children at a later time. Feelings of guild over an abortion are often provoked by society. The practitioner can play an important role in identifying women at risk of serious psychic sequelae by listening attentively to their manifestations of ambivalence and distress.",

Stress can be identified as the process in the body for adapting to influences, changes, demands, and strains to which it is exposed. Stress caused by a working environment is known as occupational stress and globally considered to be among the topmost serious health issues. Stress and burnout have reached all-time highs across various professions as stressors have become assiduous and indeterminate - employers and employees alike are scrambling to return to normalcy in the working environment. Burnout results from the physical, mental, and psychological reactions from experiencing prolonged stress. Burnout, considered an occupational phenomenon rather than a medical condition, is often exacerbated with depression and anxiety leading to concerns of employee well-being and mental health. The progressive escalation of occupational stress and burnout has gained attention from global organizations and as the nature of work continues to evolve, understanding occupational stress can support initiatives for managing it.",

      "title": "Understanding Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Management Options",
      "abstract": "Obsessive compulsive disorder is a common mental health problem. It is characterized by obsession and compulsion. Obsession can be defined as unwanted, intrusive, recurrent and persistent thoughts, images or impulses which are not voluntarily produced, but are experienced as events that invade a person's consciousness. Compulsion can be defined as repetitive and seemingly purposeful behavior that is performed according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion and is not an end in itself but is usually intended to prevent some event or situation. The obsessions or compulsions interfere significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, usual social activities, or relationships. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and several related disorders are now put together into separate chapter in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Literature search was performed with the key words \"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\", \"Obsession\", \"Compulsion\", \"Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\". Representative and leading researches from last 25 years were included in the study. Modern concepts of OCD began to evolve in the nineteenth century. Obsessions, in which insight was preserved, were gradually distinguished from delusions, in which it was not. The core features of OCD are remarkably similar from one country to the next, but its manifestations may differ for reasons of culture and experience. OCD is typically a chronic disorder with a waxing and waning course. In classical psychoanalytic theory, OCD was considered a regression from the Oedepal phase to the anal psycho-sexual phase of development. Functional brain imaging studies have produced a model for pathophysiology of OCD which involves hyperactivity in certain subcortical and cortical regions. The idea that abnormality in serotonergic neurotransmission underlies OCD arose from the observation that clomipramine, which inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, relieved symptoms, whereas noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors did not. During the last 40 years there has been considerable progress in the pharmacological management of OCD. Behavioral therapy is also considered as an effective way of controlling OCD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-documented intervention for children, adolescents, and adults with OCD. Other biological approaches for obsessive-compulsive disorder include neurosurgery, deepbrain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The neurosurgical techniques of cingulotomy and capsulotomy may provide clinical improvement among some patients with treatmentrefractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overall, stereotactic surgery should be viewed as a last option in treating refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. Faridpur Med. Coll. J. Jan 2020;15(1): 38-42",

      "title": "Some Aspects of Social Phobia and its Relationship with Substance use Disorder",
      "abstract": "Social Phobia (SP) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorder, characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in everyday social situations. People with social phobia have an intense, persistent, and chronic fear of being watched and judged by others and of doing things that will embarrass them. This excessive anxiety usually leads to avoidance behavior that can severely affect normal daily living. SP usually begins in childhood or early adolescence. There is some evidence that genetic factors are involved. A number of studies have emphasized the high co-morbidity of social phobia with a number of other psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders. Though clearly elevated there is much debate as to the nature of this relationship. Substance abuse may develop if people try to self-medicate their anxiety and make thamselves more comfortable in social situations. Anxiety may be a result of alcohol or drug abuse due to a substance's anxiogenic effects or through protracted withdrawal syndromes. Substance abusers incur more pathological and unstable life circumstances, making them more susceptible to future stress and anxiety; and there may be a genetic susceptibility in some people which makes them vulnerable to both disorders. The purpose of this article is to summarize research findings on SP and its complex relationship with substance use disorder. Clinical anxiety and substance abuse both warrant treatment and in all likelihood, each helps perpetuate the other.",

      "title": "Psychopathology in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

In studies evaluating the possible role of depression in these associations, depression among sexually assaulted persons did not account for their poorer health. Although there are unanswered questions in the literature on the associations between sexual assault and health, existing findings are consistent with standard criteria for inferring causal relationships from observational data. For example, many assault-health associations are supported by multiple, independent studies, and many demonstrate dose-response relationships (i.e., more incidents of sexual assault, or more severe assaults, are associated with more adverse health outcomes).",

Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

The Supreme Court of Korea has sometimes tried to take into account of mental and emotional injuries in determining whether the defendant has imposed `bodily injuries` on the victim. However, it still hesitates to announce that mental injury is a part of bodily injuries. To the contrary, the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines state that: “bodily injury” means injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty; or requiring medical intervention such as surgery, hospitalization, or physical rehabilitation. Impairment of a function of mental faculty will be counted on finding criminal liability under the guidelines. Too many victims are suffering from mental and emotional injuries after the criminal accident. Typical symptoms are including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder but the victims are not qualified for the compensation from the government. Furthermore, the criminal courts do not care about what has visibly happened on the brains of criminal victims. They are often ignoring recent developments in the neuro-science, which clearly shows that mental defects are resulted from the criminal act on the victims. We need to re-define what is injury. Imposing mental illness on victim must be punished on a charge of injuring. It will help the criminal victims recover from the post-traumatic symptoms and get back to their daily lifes.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric epidemiology constitutes an important subdiscipline of scientific psychiatry. Nevertheless, it still lags behind other branches of epidemiology. This has been attributed to the difficulties encountered in conceptualising and measuring mental disorders.1 It is only recently that the emphasis in the field has shifted from descriptive to analytical research and this is probably because of the influences from genetic epidemiology and social sciences.2 Psychiatric epidemiology has taken most of its tools from general epidemiology—that is, chronic disease epidemiology.3 It is therefore not surprising that no fundamental differences between the mother discipline and her psychiatric descendant exist. Yet, there are particular challenges in the conduct of psychiatric epidemiological research that are absent or less prominent in general, mostly somatically oriented, epidemiology.4 Challenges particularly encountered in psychiatric epidemiology include\n\n\n\n1. Assessment of caseness: psychiatric diagnoses are mostly made on the basis of symptoms—patients’ reports of their subjective experiences—and not signs, like fever in general medicine. Moreover, there are no pathognomonic symptoms or signs;\n\n2. Neither most mental disorders nor their best-known risk factors, like social deprivation, stress exposure, lack of social support, social isolation, abnormal personality traits or genetic liability, are as easily captured in a singular variable as tends to be the case in the epidemiology of somatic disease;\n\n3. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is costly in time and effort; and\n\n4. Information bias and non-response bias are more of a problem in psychiatric epidemiology than in other branches of epidemiology.\n\n\n\nIn our view, this warrants recognition of the epidemiology subspecialty “psychiatric epidemiology”.\n\nIn trying to cope with the above-mentioned challenges, psychiatric epidemiology has developed a set of concepts, albeit limited, and vocabulary of its own.

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

Depression is an illness characterised by the depressed mood, causing changes in the overall thinking, observation, physical condition, behaviour and social functioning. The common depression symptoms are sadness, hopelessness, anxiety, dejection, indisposition, nausea, passiveness, self-doubt, despondency, loss of interests and sources of pleasure, lack of energy and increased tiredness. Other possible symptoms include sleep deprivation, loss of appetite, concentration and attention difficulties, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, gloomy and pessimistic view of the future, and self-harming and suicidal thoughts. Poor physical health has long been recognised as one of the most important risk factors of depression in elderly people. Also, retirement, loss of workforce, stress, loss of a loved one and the grieving process cause the development of depressive symptoms.However, depression in the elderly is largely associated with physical illnesses.Physical illness and depression can develop at the same time, but depression can also appear as a consequence of a physical ilness or as a side effect of medications.Depression treatment begins after well-conducted diagnostics, based particularly on the intensity of depression (mild, moderate, severe) and comorbidity.In the treatment of depression conditions, some basic guidelines must be followed, such as sufficient treatment with an appropriate dosage of medication, the choice of antidepressants in accordance with the safety profile and clinical picture, regular combination of psychopharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and the conduction of quality evaluation.Suicide prevention is the main goal of treatment among the elderly.Despite the knowledge that antidepressants and psychological interventions are equally effective in older patients and young adults, depression in the elderly is insufficiently treated mainly because it is not adequately diagnosed.",

Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

      "title": "Defining malingering.",
      "abstract": "Malingering, also called shamming illness or goldbricking, is the false and fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of physical or mental disease or defect, performed in order to obtain money or drugs or to evade duty or criminal responsibility, or for other reasons that may be readily understood by an objective observer from the individual's circumstances, rather than from learning the individual's psychology. Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

Functional coma is an extremely rare disorder with only 21 described cases in the literature. The disease is linked to a conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder and is predominantly found in females. Predisposing factors are a history of sexual or physical abuse, psychiatric disorders, previous episodes of functional coma, and recent surgery with general anesthesia. Several clinical signs are suggestive for the diagnosis, however none of them is sufficiently sensitive or specific. Therefore, functional coma remains an exclusion diagnosis. Vital signs must be normal, just as a routine blood examination, an electroencephalogram and imaging of the central nervous system. The most important differential diagnosis are catatonia, factitious disorder, and malingering. Spontaneous recovery can be expected after a duration of about 45 minutes to 4 days.",

Die Betroffenen haben ein persönliches Ereignis erlebt, das sie als ungerecht erlebt haben. Im Vordergrund steht dabei das Erleben von massiver Ungerechtigkeit und Kränkung. Auslöser sind durchaus lebenstypische Erfahrungen wie fehlende Beförderung, berufliche Herabwürdigung, Scheidung oder Verlust eines nahestehenden Menschen, die zu einer massiven Verletzung vorhandener Wertvorstellungen führen. Die Störung geht mit einer langen Arbeitsunfähigkeit, unfreiwilligen Klinikaufenthalten ohne eigenes Therapieinteresse, Tendenz zu Chronifizierung und Nichtansprechen auf antidepressive Behandlung einher.

      "abstract": "Dental disease is frequently accompanied by anxiety and fear of the treatment and of dentists. The etiology of any anxiety is sought in early conditioning life experiences; here it may be related to infants' responses to first teething. The universality of dental anxiety makes it a paradigm of psychosomatic disorders. These are conceptualized as pathologic exaggerated reactions to early traumatizing events, a causality not unlike that of conversive-hysteric symptoms or \"normal\" bodily characteristics. Psychiatric-etiologic considerations of dental anxiety are not to be found in the literature. Recalling the cheerful manner in which children's loss of their first tooth is greeted, one gathers that repressed ambivalence is involved. A clarification of the etiology is here attempted and the dynamics compared with those of other psychosomatic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

There are alternative explanations for somatic comorbidity in depressed persons: genetic pleiotropy, iatrogenic effects, and the phenomenon 'somatic depression'. In the latter, the symptoms of depression are a consequence of clinical or subclinical somatic conditions. When treating a depressed patient, their somatic health should also be monitored. Further research is needed to examine whether specific interventions may prevent somatic comorbidity in depression.",

      "title": "OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN COMPUTER OPERATORS",
      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "title": "Myofascial Pain, Fibromyalgia or Fibrositis?",
      "abstract": "The terms myofascial pain, fibromyalgia and fibrositis are critically examined. They constitute diagnostic labels for non-specific musculoskeletal aches and pains. Analysis of the evidence shows that none of these labels is substantiated by hard physical signs or by laboratory evidence of consistent pathological or biochemical abnormality. What is the objective evidence for disorder(s) of muscle, fascia or fibrous tissues, so clearly indicated by these diagnostic names? Alternative terms such as ‘regional pain syndrome’ or ‘chronic pain syndrome’ merely redefine the clinical problem without providing a mechanism or basis for diagnosis. Despite different diagnostic criteria, these conditions, along with chronic fatigue syndrome, have many demographic and clinical similarities, most notably tender trigger points. Indeed, the terms are often used interchangeably. There are few differences in the symptoms, physical findings, laboratory tests, functional status, psychosocial features and psychiatric disorders. This paper seeks not to deny the existence of aches and pains, but to critically examine the utility of these terms. The only claimed physical sign is the presence of tender trigger points over muscles or muscle attachments. Research suggests that tender points are a measure of general distress related to pain complaints but separately associated with fatigue and depression. They are present in some normal subjects and are variable in occurrence in time in the same individual. They reflect no demonstrable pathology. It is therefore argued that none of these commonly used diagnoses represent distinct disease entities. A possible but unproven alternative hypothesis is that such symptoms relate to neural pain with both peripheral and central components, and in some instances psychological or wilful embellishment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

      "title": "Loneliness and Back Pain",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Back pain is a common reason for being absent from work and seeking medical treatment. It can result from injury, activity, and some medical conditions. Back pain consists of lower back pain and upper back pain. Back pain does have a physical cause, but it can also be triggered by precipitating factors, namely loneliness. To explain the mechanism that associates back pain with loneliness. Methods: Literature review. Results: Loneliness is divided into 2 types, namely social loneliness and emotional loneliness. Social loneliness is associated with the absence of a social network from the same circle, with which they can share the same activities or interests. Emotional loneliness can arise due to the absence of close emotional attachment. Whether or not back pain persists depends on whether the individual chooses problem-solving or problem avoidance. Loneliness in several studies increases the morbidity rate of physical and mental illness and also the mortality rate. Early detection of somatic symptoms and loneliness requires a self-measurement scale. Therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing social connection hold merit in reducing the impact of pain on engagement with activities. The treatments are usually Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Antidepressants. If necessary, consulting a psychiatrist is recommended. The cooperation of orthopedists, rheumatologists, and physical therapists with psychiatrists can be useful in improving the condition of patients. Conclusions: Recommendations for management are needed both in terms of general and specific strategies, as well as loneliness interventions.

The field is characterised by lively debates, including about the extent to which human suffering should be medicalised and the purportedly inflationary expansion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses. The ICD-11 Working Group on this topic was asked to review scientific evidence and other information on use, clinical utility, and experience with relevant ICD-10 diagnoses in various health care settings; to review proposals for the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 and consider how these may be suited for global applications; and to assemble proposals for ICD-11 with a focus on improving clinical utility. The Working Group has recommended a separate grouping of 'Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress' for ICD-11, rather than combining them with anxiety disorders as in ICD-10 or DSM-IV. Disorders Specifically Associated with Stress have two key characteristics: 1) they are identifiable based on psychopathology that differs from other mental disorders; and 2) they arise in specific association with a stressful event or series of events. For each disorder in the grouping, the stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. The stressor may range from negative life events within the normal range of experience (in the case of adjustment disorder) to traumatic stressors of exceptional severity (in the case of PTSD and Complex PTSD).",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress.

      "title": "Task‐specific Dystonias",
      "abstract": "Task‐specific dystonias are primary focal dystonias characterized by excessive muscle contractions producing abnormal postures during selective motor activities that often involve highly skilled, repetitive movements. Historically these peculiar postures were considered psychogenic but have now been classified as forms of dystonia. Writer's cramp is the most commonly identified task‐specific dystonia and has features typical of this group of disorders. Symptoms may begin with lack of dexterity during performance of a specific motor task with increasingly abnormal posturing of the involved body part as motor activity continues. Initially, the dystonia may manifest only during the performance of the inciting task, but as the condition progresses it may also occur during other activities or even at rest. Neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for the dystonia‐related abnormalities. Although the precise pathophysiology remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests reduced inhibition at different levels of the sensorimotor system. Symptomatic treatment options include oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, neurosurgical procedures, and adaptive strategies. Prognosis may vary depending upon body part involved and specific type of task affected. Further research may reveal new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and improved treatment of these conditions.",

A child is considered handicapped if he is unable to play, learn, or do things which other children of his age can do, and is unable to achieve his full physical, mental or social potential.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy can be accompanied by changes in cognition, personality, affect, and other elements of behavior. There is no single epileptic constitution or personality complex. A unifying theme to the behavior in epilepsy is diversity. As one looks at the behavioral traits reported in epilepsy, a specific and consistent pattern is lacking. Rather, extremes of behavior are accentuated: sometimes in one direction, often in both directions. Changes in emotional state are prominent among behavioral features in epilepsy. Some authors describe a prominent deepening or increase in emotionality, whereas others identify a global decrease in emotional life and content. Emotional lability is also reported. Sexuality and libido are typically decreased, but fetishism, transvestism, exhibitionism, and hypersexual episodes also occur. Concerns over morality may be lacking or exaggerated. Patients may be irritable and aggressive or timid and apathetic. The impressive list of people with epilepsy in politics, religion, arts, and sciences suggests a positive expression of this behavioral spectrum. Psychosis, depression, paranoia, and personality disorders may represent a negative pole of epilepsy-related behavioral changes. The most important aspect of behavioral changes in epilepsy for physicians is to recognize and treat dysfunctional behavior. Depression is a common problem that is often unrecognized and untreated. Other treatable problems include impotence, anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis. Identifying risk factors will, it is hoped, assist in developing methods to prevent these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The symptoms of depression include persistent low mood, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or worthlessness, and anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure. Mood is influenced by a complex interaction of genetic, social, environmental, and other factors, such as substance abuse. Depression is further characterized by dysfunctional attitudes and negative automatic thoughts or ruminations. Psychiatric diagnostic criteria distinguish patients who experience only depressive episodes (unipolar depression or major depressive disorder, MDD) from patients who experience depressive episodes but also manic ones (bipolar disorder, BD). The symptoms of mania, on the other hand, include euphoria, over-activity, distractibility, socially inappropriate behaviour, increased appetite, and impaired insight. Thus, the emotional states of patients with depression and mania can be considered to represent two polar extremes on a mood spectrum. The states manifested in depression and mania are pathological in that they are extreme, disrupt quality of life, and are persistent and often recurrent. This chapter examines not only depression in MDD, but contrasts it with the, at times similar but at times diametrically opposed, symptoms of other disorders, such as BD, to achieve better insight. It also examines resilience in healthy individuals, i.e., how can mood remain normal despite factors such as adverse life events. Research on resilience has focused on determining the protective factors that allow some individuals to have more positive outcomes, despite being exposed to a variety of stressors.",

      "title": "Psychological Morbidity Associated with Orthopedic Trauma",
      "abstract": "Little is known about the clinical consequences of psychological morbidity associated with orthopedic trauma. Previous work has reported that mental illness is an independent predictor of poor outcome following orthopedic trauma, and future studies should explore whether management of psychological symptoms independently predicts recovery from orthopedic trauma. Anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders may all flare up during the post-operative period, leading to psychiatric consultation. Other common general post-operative issues include complications related to alcohol abuse, dependence, and withdrawal; pain management in opioid-dependent patients; the presence of personality disorders and other causes of lack of cooperation; and post-operative delirium. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also common after surgery, particularly after traumatic injuries, but is underrecognized and undertreated. Previous research has evaluated these and other issues in surgical patients. Although psychiatric problems are seen less frequently than previously, the orthopaedic surgeon must remain aware of their possible effect. The prevalence of psychological illness following traumatic injuries varies according to the diagnostic criteria used in studies, the timing of the assessment and definitions of trauma. Estimates of psychological symptoms following musculoskeletal trauma have ranged from 6.5% to 51.0%. Mason assessed the psychological state of 210 male accident and emergency department patients and followed them for 18 months, at which time 30% satisfied criteria for a psychiatric disorder. A recent study of patients with severe lower limb injuries found a 42% prevalence of psychological disorder at 24-month follow-up and that only 22% of such patients reported receiving mental health services. No relation was found between injury severity and psychological distress; however, the authors suggested that low variability in injury severity might have obscured this result. McCarthy further identified a high correlation between the Brief Symptom Inventory (a measure of psychological distress) and the Sickness Impact Profile (a measure of patient function). A high index of suspicion for the presence of psychiatric disorders is important in treating the orthopaedic patient with multiple trauma, chronic disease, factitious disorder, or suspected malingering or who fails to improve with recognized treatment. Recognition of a psychiatric problem should be part of preoperative planning in orthopaedic practice, and a formal psychiatric referral for diagnosis and treatment should be made for the patient with significant psychiatric involvement. When associated psychiatric disease is diagnosed and controlled before orthopaedic treatment commences, the patient is more likely to comply with the treatment regimen, which may lead to better results. It is important for providers who care for patients with minor injury to include a psychiatric history and/or rapid screening for psychiatric disorders as part of the health assessment. Psychosocial factors, specifically, ongoing litigation and psychological symptoms are related with reduced health-related quality of life. Further, the goal of care is to help patients attain maximal functional recovery. Therefore, the presence of a positive psychiatric history or a current psychiatric disorder should stimulate a referral of these patients for appropriate emotional support and therapeutic follow-up. By doing so, providers will give patients important interventions to maximize full recovery.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death.

      "abstract": "Self-harm, suicide attempts, disordered eating, addiction, and other forms of “acting out” are associated with the trauma of surviving violence. While these behaviours are pathologized as symptoms of mental illness, they can be understood, instead, as strategies of resistance against violence. When violence is ignored or normalized, the “acting out” associated with trauma can be a means of sounding an alarm that something is very wrong. This “acting out” can be understood as an embodied form of testimony. When direct resistance to violence, such as fighting back or escaping, is thwarted or impossible, traumatic “acting out” can be a way to draw attention to and resist violence. Psychiatry, instead of answering the call of trauma by addressing the underlying violence, works to silence that call. Through incarceration, sexual violence, enforced isolation, restricted motion, threats, coercive drugging, gaslighting, and other abusive tactics, psychiatry works to undermine the embodied testimony of trauma by producing compliance. The source of the problem is shifted from the original violence and located instead in the body of the traumatized person. Successful treatment is understood as the reduction or elimination of the very “symptoms” which are in reality acts of resistance to violence. Therefore, successful treatment essentially means submission. The carceral space of psychiatry continues the work of producing compliance even after the patient has left its enclosures, extending the space of the psych ward into the everyday lives of psychiatric survivors.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages.

It is one manifestation of central pain, which is broadly defined as central neuropathic pain caused by lesions or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Thalamic pain was first described 100 years ago by Déjerine and Roussy and has been described as \"among the most spectacular, distressing, and intractable of pain syndromes\". CPSP is characterized by constant or intermittent pain and is associated with sensory abnormalities, particularly of thermal sensation. While the pain is frequently described as burning, scalding, or burning and freezing, other symptoms are usually vague and hard to characterize, making an early diagnosis particularly difficult. In fact, those who develop CPSP may no longer be under the care of health care professionals when their symptoms begin to manifest, resulting in misdiagnosis or a significant delay before treatment begins. Diagnosis is further complicated by cognitive and speech limitations that may occur following stroke, as well as by depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances. Patients may also exhibit spontaneous dysesthesia and the stimulus-evoked sensory disturbances of dysesthesia, allodynia and hyperalgesia. The present study offers a historical reference point for future clinical and basic research into this elusive type of debilitating pain.",

Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "Pain is, according to the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain, an unpleasant, sensory and emotional experience connected to real or possible tissue damage or descriptively in terms of damage. Pain is the most expressed symptom of every clinical picture of oral cavity disease and the reason for the patient to contact his dentist. The feeling of pain is individual, difficult to compare and measure. Depending on the time of its occurence, pain can be acute or chronic. Acute pain is fast and sharp, it occurs during stimulus application or immediately after the stimulus has been removed. Chronic pain is dull, slow, it appears intermittently or continually, it can be dependent on the stimulus or spontaneous. It presents more character variations than the acute pain. Such patients often come to the dentist's office, complaining about the pain which is not present at that moment. This makes diagnostics harder and widens the spectrum of pathological changes which may cause such pain. Various dental surgeries can cause painful sensations of different character, intensities and duration. It is necessary to diagnose painful sensations and to remove the cause. Prosthetic therapy can cause physical pain in many clinical phases, however, physical pain is also connected to prosthetic rehabilitation due to disrupted chewing, phonetic and aesthetic function which is ensured by a healthy and sanitized stomatognathic system. The fear of uncertainty of functioning and aesthetics without prosthetic work during the therapy implementation and the fear and uncertainty of the new prosthetic work has great effect on the patient's behaviour. The 'new' smile changes the patient's facial appearance. One becomes aware of that and engages himself in conversation with others more confidently. Properly performed prosthetic therapy raises self-confidence of a patient and can open up new opportunities in life. This is achieved by a therapist who can correctly and individually indicate prosthetic work and recognize the personality of a patient and thus adapt the way of communication during therapy. A dentist should not fear painful sensations that a patient complains about, but using his knowledge make the correct diagnosis, recognise his possible mistake at work and as fast and as more efficiently as possible reduce the feeling of pain.",

Im Gegensatz zu Erschöpfungszuständen bei Gesunden ist diese Form der Fatigue dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie über längere Zeiträume andauern kann, in keinem angemessenen Verhältnis zu vorangehenden Aktivitäten steht und sich durch Erholungsphasen nicht zurückbildet. Diese Form der Müdigkeit wird als ein multidimensionales Problem beschrieben, das physische, emotionale und kognitive Aspekte umfasst und mit einem hohen subjektiven Leidensdruck verbunden ist. Je nach Ausprägung und Verlauf der Symptomatik führt Fatigue zu einer starken Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität und schränkt die Teilhabe und Alltagsbewältigung ein. Ebenso kommt es häufig zu Einschränkungen der Arbeits- und Erwerbsfähigkeit. Wenngleich die Ursachen der Fatigue immer noch nicht vollständig geklärt sind, ist die Fatigue in Zusammenhang mit körperlichen Erkrankungen vor dem Hintergrund eines multifaktoriellen biopsychosozialen Modells zu verstehen. Die Möglichkeiten der Diagnostik und eine Übersicht über verschiedene Verfahren zur Abklärung der Fatigue werden dargestellt. Ebenso werden die Herausforderungen für die medizinische Versorgung skizziert und Hinweise für den Umgang im klinischen Alltag gegeben.",

      "abstract": "Residual symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) following treatment are increasingly recognized as having a negative impact on the patient because of their association with lack of remission, poorer psychosocial functioning, and a more chronic course of depression. Although the effects of specific residual symptoms have not been as systematically studied, several symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and concentration difficulties, commonly occur as part of the residual state in MDD. In particular, the relatively high prevalence of residual fatigue suggests that this symptom is not being adequately addressed by standard antidepressant therapies. A review of the clinical relevance of residual fatigue was undertaken, using the published literature with respect to its assessment, neurobiology, and treatment implications. The findings of this review suggest that fatigue is highly prevalent as a residual symptom; its response to treatment is relatively poor or delayed; and the presence of residual fatigue is highly predictive of inability to achieve remission with treatment as well as impaired psychosocial functioning. Recognition of the significant consequences of residual fatigue should reinforce the need for further therapeutic interventions to help reduce the impact of this symptom of MDD.",

The influence on immune functioning is more likely lateralized with left cerebral involvement than right-sided involvement. Depression, along with the accompanying neuroimmune changes, is found more frequently after left cerebral lesions than after right-sided lesions. Stress, particularly uncontrollable stress, produces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) dysfunction as measured by elevations in plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone. These changes parallel those seen in many depressed patients. But caution is called for in assessing stress and depression. In everyday life, as opposed to the laboratory, the controllable versus uncontrollable paradigm is not as useful. Attitudes, spiritual resources, hopes, and ideals can neutralize the effects of an uncontrollable stress situation, such as prisoners of war and victims of religious or ethnic persecution might experience.

Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "title": "Stress exposure, perceived stress severity, and their effects on health",
      "abstract": "While stress is one of the central concepts in many contemporary theories of health, there is no universal definition of stress or stressors. Stress is usually understood as a subjective experience of tension, pressure, distress, fear or negative emotions that occurs as a result of a perceived threat to one’s mental or physical well-being and is accompanied by an evolved biological response that facilitates adaptive reaction. While stress is conceptualized as a taxing condition, it is not understood as uniformly harmful per se. In fact, stress response is often cited as an adaptive reaction. Moreover, not every incident of stress exposure results in a disease or has an undermining effect on health. Mere exposure to stress does not warrant the healthy organism’s falling ill. Yet stress has been shown to affect health both directly and indirectly, having impact on multiple chronic conditions. Stressors vary in their severity and their ability to leave their mark on health, and it is therefore important to develop reliable methods of measuring stress to better understand how stress affects health and instigates pathology. One of the difficulties of measuring the effects of stress is connected to the distinction between external stressors and their internal appraisal. More recently, stress researchers began to make a distinction between stress exposure (i.e., facing an objectively measurable stressor) and perceived stress severity (i.e., a subjective experience of stress resulting from individual’s facing a stressor). The latter has been shown to have a superior predictive ability in terms of negative health outcomes (both breadth and depth of observed effects) compared to the former. Measurement-wise, subjective stress also tends to yield more precise results, which makes it preferable as a stress-assessment tool. The present article is a literature review study that delves into this distinction and attempts to shed light onto its implications for measuring stress and its effects on health.",

      "title": "A Case of Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder",
      "abstract": "Aims: Background: Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), classified under ICD–11 code 6B66, involves persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Depersonalization refers to a sense of detachment from one’s thoughts, emotions, or body, whereas derealization involves perceiving the external world as unreal or distorted. These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment, are not attributable to other mental disorders, substance use, or medical conditions, and occur while reality testing remains intact. Methods: Case Report. An 18-year-old female A-level student presented with a two-year history of frequent episodes in which her surroundings, including people and familiar environments, felt unreal. These episodes varied in duration and were highly distressing, particularly during emotional extremes such as heightened happiness or stress. Symptoms were most pronounced in the evenings or when she was unoccupied, leading to emotional breakdowns. Despite these experiences, she remained aware of her own reality, with disturbances centred on external perceptions. Her symptoms began following a nine-month psychiatric hospitalization. Prior to admission, she experienced unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and in the absence of an identifiable physical cause, she was diagnosed with conversion disorder. The hospitalization was distressing due to frequent invasive procedures, a perceived sense of blame for her condition, and feelings of entrapment. She subsequently developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of medical settings. However, DPDR symptoms persisted outside of PTSD-related re-experiencing episodes, causing ongoing distress and impairment. Results: Discussion: This case highlights the complex interplay between DPDR and PTSD, particularly following medical trauma. While dissociative symptoms frequently occur in PTSD, ICD–11 differentiates DPDR as a distinct disorder when symptoms persist beyond re-experiencing episodes. In this case, the patient’s prolonged hospitalization, combined with perceived invalidation and invasive interventions, likely contributed to the development of DPDR as a maladaptive dissociative response. The exacerbation of symptoms during emotional extremes aligns with research indicating that dissociation may function as an affect regulation mechanism. Trauma-related dissociation has been linked to disruptions in emotional processing, potentially interfering with adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of targeted psychological interventions to reduce distress and improve functional outcomes. Conclusion: A trauma-informed, multidisciplinary approach is essential in managing this patient’s complex presentation. Psychological interventions such as EMDR or trauma-focused CBT should be integrated with ongoing medical care to address both dissociative symptoms and physical health concerns. Collaborative management between psychiatric and medical teams will be crucial in promoting long-term recovery, enhancing her psychological resilience, and improving overall quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Climate solutions are available now, are widespread, and support psychological health.Increasing adoption of active commuting, public transportation, green spaces, and clean energy are all solutions that people can choose to support and integrate into their daily lives.These climate solutions, among others, can help to curb the stress, anxiety, and other mental illnesses incurred from the decline of economies, infrastructure, and social identity that comes from damage to the climate.Major acute mental health impacts include increases in trauma and shock, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compounded stress, anxiety, substance abuse, and depression.Climate changeinduced extreme weather, changing weather patterns, damaged food and water resources, and polluted air impact human mental health.Increased levels of stress and distress from these factors can also put strains on social relationships and even have impacts on physical health, such as memory loss, sleep disorders, immune suppression, and changes in digestion.Major chronic mental health impacts include higher rates of aggression and violence, more mental health emergencies, an increased sense of helplessness, hopelessness, or fatalism, and intense feelings of loss.These feelings of loss may be due to profound changes in a personally important place (such as one's home) and/ or a sense that one has lost control over events in one's life due to disturbances from climate change.Additionally, a sense of loss regarding one's personal or occupational identity can arise when treasured objects are destroyed by a disaster or place-based occupations are disrupted by climate change.Personal relationships and the ways in which people interact in communities and with each other are affected by a changing climate.Compounded stress from a changing environment, ecomigration, and/or ecoanxiety can affect community mental well-being through the loss of social identity and cohesion, hostility, violence, and interpersonal and intergroup aggression.Recent increases in natural disasters illustrate the relationship between the acceleration of climate change and severe weather.Areas that endure a natural disaster face a number of risks and difficulties.Direct physical impacts range from brute physical trauma to more pernicious effects, like increased incidence of infectious disease, asthma, heart disease, and lung problems.These physical health impacts interact with mental health impacts, which is why they are detailed in this report on page 39.In this section, we use floods, the most common form of natural disasters (EM-DAT, 2011, as reported in Alderman, Turner, & Tong, 2012), as an example to illustrate the ways in which direct health impacts of disasters come about.",

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity. It was found that no concise overview exists on this topic that reflects clinical as well as recent research findings. Therefore, this supplement was planned.

It is of equal importance compared with others in the 21st century. Stress management is a common phenomenon globally. The imbalance of any occasion creates stress. The most significant factors include separated from family, loneliness, fatigue, multi-nationality, limited recreation activity, and dissatisfaction of job opportunity, which tends to cause healthcare issues, especially sleep deprivation and depression. The long-lasting stress causes chronic mental fatigue. It has positive and negative impacts, which depend on situations. Sometimes it plays as a motivating factor for peak performance and great opportunity, or sometimes negative like when a person faces social, physical, organizational, and emotional problems.",

      "abstract": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) has been defined as the sudden death of an individual involving an acute (minutes to hours) transient disturbance in consciousness and cognition, marked by disorientation, disorganized and inconsistent thought processes, inability to distinguish reality from hallucinations, disturbances in speech, disorientation to time and place, and misidentification of individuals. 1 In a majority of these deaths the individual exhibited violent behaviors, struggled with police, correction officers, or medical personnel during control and physical restraint of the person, within a matter of several minutes after the cessation of the struggle the person is observed to be in cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation is usually unsuccessful.Frequently an autopsy does not reveal anatomic evidence to show trauma or natural disease or toxicological findings sufficient to explain the death.Commonly, pathologists cite the symptoms of ExDS on the death certificate as contributing factors of the death. 2-4Deaths associated with ExDS were first reported in a case report in 1849 when psychiatrist Dr. Luther Bell at the McClean Asylum for the Insane in Massachusetts described the condition of 40 mentally ill patients who died from a fatal new disease. 5Common features observed in these patient's deaths included: fever, rapid pulse, increasing confusion, loss of appetite and sleep, mania, and violent behaviors.Patients condition deteriorated over several weeks before dying.The clinical condition was referred to as Bell's Mania or acute exhaustive mania and is considered the forerunner of the syndrome of ExDS. 1,2,4,6Other case reports described similar symptoms of Bell's Mania and were referred to as acute delirious mania, lethal catatonia, acute psychotic furors exhaustive syndrome, and typhoma.As new antipsychotic medications emerged through the 1950s, the incidence of deaths associated with Bell's Mania declined.By the mid-1980s a number of deaths associated with cocaine use were reported by Fishbain and Wetli and they described symptoms associated with chronic stimulant abuse as excited delirium. 7Common factors observed in these deaths included: acute drug intoxication, mental illness, agitation, hyperactivity, violence, bizarre and self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and elevated body temperature.For years there has been a controversy as to a standardized case definition of ExDS.Case report and post-mortem literature since the 1990s has shown that ExDS comprises several clinical features including: delirium with agitation, hyperthermia, violent agitation, acute psychotic behavior, bizarre behaviors, profuse sweating, incoherent speech, extraordinary strength and endurance, lack of response to painful stimuli, hyperactivity, respiratory arrest, and",

We also don’t know why some patients get better when they take the drugs and why others patients don’t see a positive effect. However, observing from a social perspective the phenomenon of mental illness, we can certainly affirm that it affects not only the patient but also the person close to him or her family. Psychological problems require the involvement of loved ones. They also require education concerning psychopathology. Sometimes, a situation set the family up in particularly difficult dilemma. Disturbing patient condition, aggressive behavior, hallucination cause that a patient can become dangerous for yourself or others. In this situation, it's very often necessary to take obligatory actions against an ill person. This person claims to be healthy.

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a disease that occurs frequently. However, people do not know much about this disease and many doctors find it difficult to diagnose such patients. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may not only include pain, but also sleep disorder, fatigue, melancholia, and other mood disorders. Pain is one of the major symptoms of many diseases and may greatly impede the quality and functionof an individual's life. Yet many clinicians have trouble treating chronic pain in part because they focus on the pain itself, which is merely one of the causes, and not on the evaluation and treatment of problems incidental to pain. It is noted that pain may be accompanied by not only physical suffering, but also emotional problems, such as melancholia and other secondary problems. The causes for fibromyalgia syndrome have not yet been clearly revealed but it is known that mental factors contribute to the occurrence and progress of the symptoms, and that the evaluation of or therapeutic interventions for the mental causes may be due to physical effects. Therefore, based on ad-equate psychiatric knowledge, clinicians should under-stand and treat the patients accordingly. It may be that more effective medical services are needed through in-tensive treatments in multidisciplinary teams for the patients. This article is aimed at investigating the psychological issues that fibromyalgia patients encounter. It also considers the psychiatric drugs and psychosocial treatment that are applied to the disease.",

      "abstract": "Summary More than a cosmetic nuisance, acne can produce anxiety, depression, and other psychological problems that affect patients' lives in ways comparable to life‐threatening or disabling diseases. Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy by itself may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychological comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if depressive‐anxious disorders are suspected, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also in disrupted compliance.Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist should have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be combined with systemic and topical treatment of acne in conjunction with basic psychosomatic treatment.",

Non-specific low back pain is the most common type, it makes 85% of all cases.

If serious pathology is suspected, patient should be reffered to a specialist. Radiological diagnostics and additional tests are not necessary in patients with non-specific low back pain and low back pain with radiculopathy in the first 4-6 weeks. The most common causes of non-specific low back pain are: muscle and ligament strain, degenerative changes, spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. The most common causes of back pain with radiculopathy are disc herniation and spinal stenosis. Back pain caused by other, specific causes is rare and potential causes are numerous. Psychogenic and psychosomatic back pain require multidisciplinary approach . Yellow flags and Waddell signs can help in diagnosis. Non-specific low back pain and back pain with radiculopathy are treated with NSAIDs or acetaminophen and muscle relaxants, along with other recommendations.

It is often stated that the pain is the most common symptom in clinical practice, a frequent cause of functional impairment of individual inability to function in a normal way, and the most common reason for seeking medical help. In patients who suffer from a long-term feeling of intense pain, efficiency and working ability are reduced and their emotional state is damaged as well. Due to long-term treatment and damaged everyday functioning, these patients often find themselves as social and financial issues. Knowledge about pain goes back far into the history of medical science and says that pain is a symptom of disease and will disappear when the underlying disease is cured. Nowadays, especially the chronic pain is identified as an independent health issue that can and must be treated. The pain is not only the transmission of impulses from the place of injury to the perception area of the brain but a phenomenon that is influenced by factors quantitative, qualitative and sensory, as well as cultural, social and economic. In addition to physical damage, the combination of psychological, social and spiritual component leads us to the concept of total pain definition. Therefore, it is necessary to act to all these causes for complete pain relief. Pain is an important public health issue worldwide. Despite the tremendous progress of science with new technological discoveries and pharmacological agents, pain is still a worldwide problem. It is a basic human right to live without pain, which means that the health care system is responsible to provide help to anyone who feels pain.",

      "abstract": "There is increased risk caused by social difficulties and/or childhood trauma for developing both general medical and mental health conditions, with overlap in similarity of magnitude of some increased risks, although intermediary mechanisms may differ. Social factors are the most important determinants of health status. Reducing social adversity and childhood trauma would improve the physical and mental health of the population. Life events and stresses/hassles are a more specific risk factor for mental health problems. Social factors are often inadequate to explain the nature and severity of people’s mental health problems without taking into account psychobiological factors. Given the greater effect of culture on how mental health conditions are expressed, there is some overlap between psychiatric and general medical diagnostic constructs rather than near total overlap. Mental health conditions do seem associated with greater stigma (some of this seems related to the categorical nature of diagnostic constructs) and also with greater use of coercion than for general medical conditions, but this also occurs for general medical conditions hence the conclusion of some overlap.",

      "title": "Post‐traumatic stress disorder as moderator of other mental health conditions",
      "abstract": "The comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a range of other mental disorders is common. This comorbidity is often attributed to either overlapping symptoms between PTSD and other disorders or to the variety of psychiatric conditions that can arise in the wake of exposure to a traumatic experience. However, this comorbidity may also be due to the fact that PTSD can moderate the onset or severity of other psychiatric symptoms or disorders. This is an important issue, because it has implications for how patients affected by the array of symptoms that can emerge after trauma may be most efficiently managed. Our knowledge of how PTSD can impact other disorders rests on longitudinal studies that have assessed PTSD and other conditions, and have typically conducted cross-lagged or time-series analyses. This approach allows us to determine the extent to which each condition impacts other disorders at later assessments. Convergent evidence indicates that PTSD can precede or exacerbate depression, anxiety disorders, suicidality, substance abuse, eating disorders, and psychosis1. Furthermore, PTSD can precede a range of physical and behavioral indicators, including chronic pain and tobacco use. There is also evidence from network analysis indicating how symptoms of PTSD may impact other psychiatric symptoms. Network analysis conceptualizes psychopathological states as resulting from causal paths between different symptoms – rather than emerging from an underlying disease state2, 3. For example, the PTSD symptom of nightmares may play a causal role in contributing to sleep disturbance, which in turn leads to concentration deficits and irritability. Numerous studies using network analysis have shown that specific PTSD symptoms can influence problems across other conditions, including depression and anx­iety disorders4. In explaining the role of PTSD as a mediator of the relationship between trauma exposure and onset of other psychiatric disorders, there are several mechanisms that can be considered, and these arguably function in an interactive manner. One key potential mechanism is the impact of PTSD on the capacity to down-regulate emotional distress. It is well documented that PTSD involves impaired emotion regulation, and it is possible that this impairment predisposes people to develop new psychiatric disorders or worsens others5. The capacity to regulate emotions in PTSD can be related to the well-documented deficits in executive functioning6. Deficient working memory and attentional capacity can limit the extent to which one can regulate emotions, which can result in greater risk for mental health problems. Moreover, avoidance is a key symptom of PTSD, and this can trigger a cascade of strategies that can be maladaptive. Avoidance can involve situations or thoughts and memories related to the traumatic experience. This tendency can generalize to more pervasive avoidance of social networks, emotional states, and activities that promote good mental health. This can lead to a worsening of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions. Another common form of avoidance for people with PTSD is self-medicating with prescription or non-prescription substances to numb the distress that is experienced along with traumatic memories. This behaviour can not only lead to substance abuse, which has been documented in longitudinal studies of PTSD, but also facilitate other psychiatric problems, because issues may not be addressed in a constructive manner. Avoidance tendencies can also result in not seeking help from mental health services, which can impede early intervention or adequate treatment for other psychiatric disorders. The DSM-5 explicitly recognizes the presence of harmful behaviors in PTSD, including such risk-taking behaviors as dangerous driving, severe alcohol use, and self-harm. These reactions are conceptualized as a result of the extreme arousal and the difficulties in impulse control that can be experienced by people with PTSD7. These behaviors can lead to a range of events and habits triggering repetitive cycles of exposure to trauma. This can compound the sensitization that has been reported in PTSD, in which the condition results in neural sensitivity to threats and stressors in one's environment, such that the person is more reactive to these events. One of the strongest transdiagnostic predictors of risk for mental health problems is represented by maladaptive or catastrophic appraisals about oneself or the environment8. A key feature of PTSD is the tendency to engage in catastrophic appraisals after the traumatic experience, and these appraisals can generalize to many aspects of a person's life, such as one's self-esteem, trust in others, fears of negative evaluations, germs, or self-blame. These cognitive tendencies are major risk factors for an array of psychiatric conditions, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Relatedly, the tendency to ruminate is well documented after trauma, and this habit of repeatedly thinking about negative events is a major risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. In considering these various mechanisms for how PTSD can moderate other psychiatric problems, it is worth noting that many of the risk factors reviewed here may be present prior to trauma exposure, and in fact predispose the person to developing PTSD. These elements can be intensified as PTSD develops, and then contribute to other psychiatric conditions which have a shared vulnerability. In this context, it is especially worth recognizing the emerging evidence on shared genetic vulnerabilities to a range of psychiatric disorders9. In the wake of trauma exposure and PTSD development, gene expression can predispose an individual to develop other psychiatric disorders by means of the shared genetic vulnerability. Overall, this evidence reflects the interactive multifactorial nature of the processes explaining how PTSD can lead to the onset or worsening of other psychiatric conditions. Understanding how PTSD can impact on other psychological problems is an important area of future research, because it has important treatment implications. Targeting PTSD may have downstream benefits for many problems beyond the specific domain of that disorder.",

      "abstract": "Non-organic voice disorders are characterised by an impaired voice sound, and/or reduced vocal capacity, and/or laryngeal sensory disturbances, all in the absence of causal organic laryngeal pathology. Psychogenic causes, a \"psychological disequilibrium\", and an increased tension of the laryngeal muscles are presumed to be one end of the spectrum of possible factors leading to the development of the disorder. In making a diagnosis, perceptive and acoustic methods for voice analysis are used in addition to the ENT-examination and the laryngostroboscopy. An assessment of the degree to which the patient feels him/herself subjectively affected by the voice disorder also plays an important role. If the history reveals any indication of psychosocial stress or conflict, the patient is offered psychological consultations. These conflicts seem less often to be deep rooted psychopathological problems but rather daily anxieties, failures, injuries, annoyances, disappointments regarding the sufferer him/herself and others, the non-fulfillment of desires, feelings of inadequacy and of lack of self-confidence. The patients may find it difficult to speak about conflicts and feelings, and they follow social conventions to an excessive extent. In frustrating situations patients tend to react aggressively towards themselves rather than towards others and are too quick in seeking a solution to any problem that may arise. The role of the voice as a \"barometer of emotion\", where a disorder may be regarded as a sign of emotional stress, has to be taken into consideration before starting a therapy: If the non-organic voice disorder is obviously due to vocal misuse and muscle tension, a more symptom-orientated voice therapy may be favoured. If psychosocial stress seems to play a greater role, additional counseling may be necessary. Only by using this approach can the patient be offered a therapy which goes into the causes and thereby addresses the whole person.",

Thus the causal relationship between back pain and work is far from clear, a difficulty compounded by the prevalence of back symptoms in all groups of the population. There are few epidemiologically established methods for identifying people who are susceptible to a first attack of back pain, though, once back pain has been reported, recurrence may be predicted. Selection of the preventive approach depends on reliable information about the prevalence of back pain/discomfort, the back injury rate, sickness absence, etc; about accidents, work stoppages, job turnover, or any other pointers to the design of the workplace or work practices; and about the resulting losses of productivity and the costs of the remedy.

      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

Reaction to pain cannot be easily generalized; group differences are postulated, based on sex, age, culture, psychiatric diagnosis and personality variables. Early developmental aspects of pain and discussed in animal studies and case reports but little systematic data exist. Experimental findings show the influence on pain response of cognitive and emotional factors. Clinically, the variables determining perception, reporting and reaction to pain are numerous and harder to study scientifically. Acute and chronic pain should be distinguished: the latter is more complicated, leading of ten to diagnostic problems and management stalemates. Discovering the relationship of pain to emotional phenomena, as cause or effect, is difficult, though essential to effective treatment. Various frames of reference apply: e.g., individual medical, familial, and \"workmen's compensation\" models. Reaction by family, lawyer, or work commission involves potential secondary gain and may reinforce or discourage pathological responses by the patient. The potential of pain for symbolic meaning and its acceptance as a \"legitimate\" medical symptom renders it ideal for both expression and masquerading of intrapsychic and interpersonal conflicts involving anger, punishment, control and dependency. Teaching about pain and its significance is best done in clinical settings such as obstetrical units and multidisciplinary pain clinics. Videotaped modular presentations with discussion provide a satisfactory though less desirable alternative.",

Such patients are ubiquitous in all medical care settings, pose difficult diagnostic and management problems, and overutilize health care thus contributing to its cost. Somatization may be transient or persistent, and may or may not be associated with a diagnosable medical or psychiatric disorder. The most common concurrence of somatization is with affective and anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, the somatoform disorders. Persistent somatization poses a serious clinical, social, and economic problem and hence early identification of potential chronic somatizers should be attempted to avoid its development.

There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition.

      "title": "Bodily Complaints and Other Symptoms of Depressive Reaction",
      "abstract": "Medical clinic patients with \"functional\" bodily complaints were commonly found to have a depressive reaction. This reaction consists of bodily symptoms and disturbances in relations, both interpersonal (withdrawl, irritability, and resentment) and intrapersonal (depressed mood, loss of pleasure in usual activities, helplessness, and injured self-esteem). The diagnosis is made on the history of a traumatic event which the patient perceives as a loss, rather than on symptoms alone. Diagnosis is important because the bodily symptoms are commonly used as a reason for coming to the doctor, because care of the patient demands recognition of all aspects of his illness, and because rational treatment depends on it. Treatment involves several roles of the doctor and his explicit or implicit use of some psychotherapeutic techniques in his medical practice. Four case histories illustrate these principles.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The placebo effect, or placebo response, is a psychobiological phenomenon that must not be confounded with other phenomena, such as spontaneous remission and statistical regression to the mean. The nocebo effect, or nocebo response, is a negative placebo effect, which goes in the opposite direction compared to the placebo effect. There are many placebo effects with different biological mechanisms and in different systems and apparatuses that are triggered by the psychosocial context around the patient and the therapy. Expectation of a future outcome plays a central role, and may act through different mechanisms, such as reduction in anxiety and activation of reward circuits. Learning plays a crucial role, and powerful placebo effects may be induced through a conditioning procedure. Placebo and placebo-related effects may be related to other self-regulatory processes and may have emerged during evolution as a defence mechanism of the body.",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

      "title": "Emotional deficiency and psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Aside from an antisocial life-style, the concept of psychopathy is based on character features which can be described in terms of specific patterns of interpersonal, behavioral, and, in particular, affective characteristics. Concluding from studies which have dealt with the affective domain in psychopaths, emotional deficiency may predispose to violence in several ways. (1) Poor conditioning implicates a failure to review the harmful consequences of one's actions leading to a deficit of avoidance behavior. (2) Emotional detachment prevents experiencing feelings, which naturally inhibit the acting out of violent impulses. (3) Emotional deficiency is closely associated with a general underarousal, leading to sensation seeking. Current data suggest that there may be a close association between difficulties in emotional processing and poor prefrontal functioning. From a psychosocial perspective, psychopaths were shown to have been exposed to severe familial and societal difficulties. Whether biological or environmental factors dominate in the etiology of this personality disorder, psychopathy does not per se justify the assumption of decreased legal responsibility.

The sociological plane introduces further complications. Impairment of cardiovascular function may not necessarily be equated with \"disability.\" Satisfactory and productive activity really expresses a state of relativity, as the ability (or disability) of an individual is a resultant of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. These are, on the one hand, the physiological capacity and the emotional integration of the individual; and on the other hand, the degree of family involvement, the nature of job requirements, and even the particular community attitudes and legal (compensation laws) outlook in regard to employment of the handicapped. Nevertheless, some estimate of a patient recovering from a cardiovascular breakdown is desirable for several reasons. In view of the lack of any information,",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

These patients have no apparent diagnosable dermatologic or medical condition that explains the cutaneous symptom, and typically have negative findings upon medical workup. Skin regions that normally have a greater density of epidermal innervation tend to be more susceptible to the development of CSD. CSDs can affect any body region but generally tend to be confined to the face, scalp and perineum, and have been referred to in the literature with region-specific terms such as burning mouth syndrome, glossodynia and vulvodynia. Symptoms such as pruritus with unexplained hyperhidrosis may occur during sleep, as a result of heightened sympathetic tone. Sleep deprivation and insomnia can play a moderating role in CSD. Somatization and dissociation can play a central role in the pathogenesis of CSDs. A review of the literature suggests that CSDs represent a complex, and often poorly understood interplay between neurobiological factors associated with neuropathic pain, neuropathic itch and neurologic/neuropsychiatric states (eg, radiculopathies, stroke, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). These neurologic/neuropsychiatric states can modulate pain and itch perception by potentially affecting the pain and itch pathways at a structural and/or functional level.",

Stress may also take the form of personal insult if dentists are regarded as incompetent when compared with their peers, or are seen as insensitive, inconsiderate and inferior to doctors. Attempting to stay on schedule in a busy dental practiceis a chronic source of stress. Not receiving commensurate payment for their services, anxiety about the future and long working hours may also act as stressors. Stress is not good for health! It is well known that stress and poor stress management increase susceptibility and vulnerability to ill health including cardiovascular disease, ulcers, colitis, hypertension, lower back pain, eye strain, maritaldis harmony, alcoholism, drug addiction, mental depression and even suicide. How does stress manifest in the practice? It may result in absenteeism, increased incident rate, inter-personal aggression, poor quality control, low productivity, high aggression, low productivity, high turnover, reduced morale, complaints and litigation.",

It is a challenge for psychiatrists and other physicians to accurately diagnose and treat the patient. There are patients who insist that they have a medical problem and whose claim is not confirmed by physical examination or laboratory testing. The psychological need to have a physical complaint is the psychiatric disorder for this group of patients. At the other end of this physical–psychiatric continuum are patients, without obvious physical discomfort to suggest a medical condition, who may be misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder because their presentation is atypical, or their complaints are primarily in the domain of how they feel or how they think. Physicians' understanding of the role of culture and cultural biases toward mental illness and of the physical components of mood and anxiety disorders results in a consideration of a psychiatric diagnosis. This process occurs even in the absence of the patient's complaint of psychological symptoms. Instances in which patients' physical complaints are parts of mood and anxiety disorders may cause diagnostic confusion for physicians who consider only medical diagnoses. When it comes to the diagnostic consideration of a psychiatric versus a medical condition we know that it is not either/or but it often is both.",

Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

CFS remains a poorly defined entity with an ill-defined etiological background. CFS is neither a novel diagnosis nor a new medical condition. From as early as the eighteenth century, a constellation of perplexing array of symptoms were observed that had descriptions resembling accompanying symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. During each time lapse, a certain concept was popularized. Commencing with febricula and ending with CFS, several terms were proposed including neurocirculatory asthenia, atypical poliomyelitis, Royal Free disease, effort syndrome, Akureyri disease, Tapanui disease, chronic Epstein–Barr virus syndrome, and myalgic encephalitis, among others. Moving to the modern era, it remains unclear whether CFS has an autoimmune component or is it a condition that precedes a full-blown autoimmune. Due to the various clinical presentations, accumulated evidence highlights the overlap with other conditions including postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS), autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), and Sjögren's syndrome, among others. It is postulated that an autoimmune disease would manifest early with ill-defined symptoms (e.g. typical of CFS), which when exposed to a secondary stimulus (e.g. antigen) might cause an acceleration of the natural course of the disease and, hence, a full-blown autoimmune disease. In this chapter, a historical background review of this disease and appraisal of our current rational regarding CFS are provided.",

Amongst the reasons for this are high rates of co-occurrence of different diagnostic constructs, which themselves are often polythetic in nature. People who meet criteria for a diagnostic construct may have little or even no clinical features in common. These diagnostic constructs rely on people meeting the diagnostic criteria having similar qualities to their condition such as similar likelihoods of outcomes/responses to treatments. These highly variable clinical pictures are seen even when clear disease is involved, such as the dementias. General medical diagnostic constructs can also display highly variable clinical pictures even when clear disease processes have been identified. Polythetic diagnostic criteria decided upon by expert committees are also used for general medical diagnostic constructs which can also result in people meeting the same diagnostic criteria having little in common in their clinical pictures. Co-occurrence is also common in general medicine. Psychological formulation does not have to address the issue of variable clinical pictures. Both symptom-based and dimensional classifications can depict variable clinical pictures more accurately than diagnostic constructs but there are pragmatic issues such as suitability for brief appointments or emergency work.",

      "title": "Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief",
      "abstract": "At first glance, acute grief would not seem to be a medical or psychiatric disorder in the strict sense of the word but rather a normal reaction to a distressing situation. However, the understanding of reactions to traumatic experiences whether or not they represent clear-cut neuroses has become of ever-increasing importance to the psychiatrist. Bereavement or the sudden cessation of social interaction seems to be of special interest because it is often cited among the alleged psychogenic factors in psychosomatic disorders. The enormous increase in grief reactions due to war casualties, furthermore, demands an evaluation of their probable effect on the mental and physical health of our population. The points to be made in this paper are as follows: i. Acute grief is a definite syndrome with psychological and somatic symptomatology. 2. This syndrome may appear immediately after a crisis; it may be delayed; it may be exaggerated or apparently al)sent. 3. In place of the typical syndrome there may appear distorted pictures, each of which represents one special aspect of the grief syndrome. 4. By appropriate techniques these distorted pictures can be successfully transformed into a normal grief reaction with resolution. Our observations comprise tot patients. Included are (i) psychoneurotic patients who lost a relative during the course of treatment, (2) relatives of patients who uied in the hospital, (3) bereaved disaster victims (Cocoanut Grove Fire) and their close relatives, ( ) relatives of members of the armed forces.",

      "abstract": "People react to illness in a manner that reflects a complex and evolving interaction of several factors. Most illnesses, except the very trivial, require a period of adjustment and a re-appraisal of lifestyle, ability to work and engagement in leisure activities. Potentially fatal and rapidly progressive disease might be expected to result in more severe psychological reactions, but the evidence indicates that there is surprisingly little correlation between psychiatric morbidity and disease severity when this has been measured in a standardized manner. Metabolic changes accentuate the emotional response to illness. Effective communication is an essential element of good clinical practice. Conversely, poor communication is a source of frustration for patients, leading to uncertainty, resentment, anxiety and depression. Depression resulting from the emotional impact of an illness follows an appraisal of the implications that the illness has on relationships, lifestyle, work prospects, long-term disability and mortality.",

The consequences of stress-related anxiety can be found in most of the body systems: cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal ailments, problems with the reproductive system, dermatologic disorders, and autoimmune disturbances--all have been shown to be greatly influenced by anxiety. In addition, studies of hostages and prisoners of war indicate that a person's reactions to extreme stress are predictive of his or her future physical and mental health.

When the individual refuses to accept medical opinion and attributes the pain to a physical illness and persistently seeks diagnosis and treatment, then there is a possibility of an unexplained somatic problem. Depression, anxiety or even a personality disorder may be causative factors. The lack of studies of this type of disorder in the prison environment makes it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of this phenomenon for primary health care consultation in prison, despite the fact that the number of presented unexplained somatic complaints may well be the same as in the community (around 15%). Management of this type of patient is always difficult, complex and emotionally demanding for the health care professional.",

Chronic pain is difficult to treat and often the interventions fail. This failure is, in part due to the fact that chronic pains usually result as a manifestation of some chronic degenerative, inflammatory or neoplastic process. As far as the choice of interventions is concerned, the indication for its use may not be well justified, and the choice itself may be determined by the type of specialist and not by the actual clinical picture. The various treatment interventions usually fail due to non- compliance of patients towards the untoward side effect of the systemically used drugs. The patient may not receive the treatment for appropriate time and dosage due to the side effects. Furthermore, indication of specific treatment modality depends upon the evidence of positive effects of the modality, as indicated in various control trials or the related literature2.",

      "abstract": "The recent plethora of lawsuits involving allegations of iatrogenically implanted memories of satanic ritual abuse and other traumas has highlighted the existence of a unique group of psychiatric patients. Although these patients are often successful at deceiving therapists (and sometimes juries), the case studies in this special issue reveal the chronic nature of their propensity to invent traumatic identities and past histories. The core clinical features of affect dysregulation, somatization, and impaired object relations, together with frequent histories of alcohol and substance abuse, parallel the psychiatric co-morbidity frequently found in genuine trauma victims. These case studies also point to early childhood problems in attachment, and sometimes to real childhood trauma, as possible etiologic factors. The current diagnostic system does not adequately capture the full range of these patients' psychopathology, which involves the creation of factitious identities and fictional traumatic personal histories. The particulars of these histories change over time as the patients incorporate, deliberately and/or “unconsciously,” details derived from outside sources. Although clearly susceptible to being influenced by authority figures of all kinds, it is evident from these case studies that the core psychopathology at work here is intrinsic to the patients and not the by-product of therapeutic misadventure.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

Conceiving of depression as a stand-alone diagnostic entity repeats the mistake of assuming a division between the mind and the body. Depression and anxiety frequently coexist, and generalized anxiety disorder may precede a major depression. Most mood disorders are dealt with at the level of primary care. The current understanding and clinical approach to them is dominated by a model derived from psychiatry, where there are significant differences in patient population and priorities from those in family practice. Family medicine has come under criticism for uncritically accepting this model and for failing to develop a model suitable for the family practice setting.",

      "title": "Analysis of Significant Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) Variations in Psychological Stress",
      "abstract": "Purpose: Mental stress and other psychosomatic disorders have been linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in population studies. There hasn't been a thorough examination as to whether emotional or physical stresses might cause sporadic ventricular arrhythmias in vulnerable patients. An outsized and mounting body of discovery shed light on the fact that internal health is interrelated to risk factors for heart complaint before an opinion of an internal health complaint and through treatment. These things can arise both directly, through natural pathways, and laterally, through parlous health actions. People who are passing through clinical depression, anxiety disorders, common and general stress syndromes, and indeed post-traumatic stress disorder commonly known as PTSD over an absolute period of your occasion may observe definite physiological alterations in the body, similarly, as a highly enlarged cardiac reactivity such as augmented vital signs and elevated blood pressure, deducted or condensed blood inflow directly to the center, and heightened or highly raised amount of an organic chemical compound called cortisol. Over time, these physiologic processes may generate calcium particle depositions or buildup within the normal organic pathways. It may also manifest events of body metabolic dysfunction as well as cardiac conduction problems. Substantiation shows that many physiological and psychiatric/psychological diseases -similar to chronic clinical depression, psychological stress, and PTSD can appear after any cardiac event regardless of its severity. Objective: The focal objective of this article is to identify psychological stress, its influence on cardiac problems such as cardiac arrhythmia, and its symptomatic manifestations on an electrocardiogram. Apart from that, this paper also focuses on the area of how ECG changes due to psychological distress. Another objective of this paper is to provide vivid information about psychological stress and its link with acute and chronic cardiac pathologies. Laymen should know the fact that the mind and the body are linked with each other and if the mind is distressed for a long time will affect the health condition of the physical body also. Design/Methodology/Approach: To build the paper, mostly secondary information has been used from various sources such as clinical literature, journals, websites, etc. Primary information has also been used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the paper. Primary data have been taken from neuropsychologists, cardiologists, clinical psychopathologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. Based on all these databases, systematic and scientific clinical analysis of information has been done to avoid any mistakes and errors. Findings/Result: In people with ICDs, stress and physical exercise might cause ventricular rhythm abnormalities. Future studies into medicines that prevent these stimuli' responses might reduce ventricular arrhythmias and upsets in some of these patients. People with type A personalities should try to control or adjust their innate personality and character to reduce the vulnerability to develop any kind of cardiac arrhythmia or any other cardiac pathologies. All ECG variations and arrhythmias are not related to psychological stress rather it needs differential diagnosis to rule out any other underlying problems. A thorough differential investigation is suggested to rule out whether the cardiac problem is due to psychological stress or not. Originality and value: A comprehensive analysis and interpretation have been made to cover the concerned topic of study and make information more reliable and valid. A new initiative is taken to provide information about the mind and heart link. Paper Type: Secondary clinical report analysis/interpretive paper",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Despite 50 years of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, schizophrenia remains one of the leading causes of disability. The inability to function in everyday settings includes deficits in performance of social, occupational, and independent living activities. Schizophrenia is also a life-shortening illness, caused mainly by poor physical health and its complications. Dysfunctional lifestyles including sedentary behavior and lack of physical activity prevail, while treatment with adipogenic psychotropic medication interacts with poor performance in screening, monitoring, and intervention that result in shortening of life expectancies by 25 to 30 years. Disability interferes with self-care and medical care, further worsening physical health to produce a vicious cycle of disability. Further, the neurobiological impact of obesity on brain functioning is substantial and relevant to schizophrenia. Simultaneous treatment of cognitive deficits and related deficits in functional skills, ubiquitous determinants of everyday functioning in schizophrenia, and targeted interventions aimed at poor physical health, especially obesity and associated comorbidities, may lead to additive or even interactive gains in everyday functioning in patients with schizophrenia not previously realized with other interventions.",

The dysfunction is determined by complex genetic, neurochemical and neurophysiological factors. Exacerbation of the symptoms may weaken the control over the disturbed impulses and compulsions, which in turn may lead to violation of law. Therefore, a forensic-psychiatric evaluation in cases related to patients suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorders has to include very complex relations between the type and the circumstances of the committed act or the undertaken actions and the type and intensity of these disorders.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

      "abstract": "Motion sickness typically is associated with motion of physical or virtual vehicles. However, the symptoms that are associated with motion sickness also occur in other situations. Under classical theories of motion sickness etiology, these other situations are interpreted as not inducing motion sickness; that is, the symptoms are attributed to different causal factors. In this article, I review situations that are characterized by motion sickness-like symptoms, and I suggest that they share a common etiological basis in unstable control of posture. The postural instability theory of motion sickness etiology argues that motion sickness symptoms are a consequence of instability in control of the body and its parts. Within this theory any circumstance that gives rise to unstable control of the body and/or its parts can give rise to motion sickness symptoms. I argue that postural instabililty may arise in physical and virtual vehicles but also in other situations. I suggest that the symptoms associated with these situations may be caused by postural instability and that, accordingly, they may constitute instances of motion sickness. For this reason it may be appropriate to classify motion sickness as a type of acute, transient movement disorder.",

The condition mimics psychotic hallucination, seizure, or other behavioral disorders, potentially causing management delay. We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

It can be caused by external factors like pathogens, or caused by internal malfunctions mainly the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity such as allergies and autoimmunity. Diseases are broadly classified to any abnormal condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person affected with similar problems. It includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviours, and atypical variations of structure and its function and for others these may be considered as distinguishable categories. Diseases can affect people not only physically and mentally, as living with a disease will alter the affected person's thinking ability. Death caused by disease are often natural.

In this concluding paper we review the historical and theoretical background, discuss the evidence and theoretical positions in the contributions, and draw some conclusions. Traditional psychosomatic models had less predictive value and less therapeutic importance than what was hoped for. The main problem with these models was the lack of a pathophysiological explanation for why psychological problems could be related to somatic disease. Sustained arousal or \"allostatic load\" offers more plausible and acceptable mechanisms for pathology, and, to some extent, for sensitization and illness. The combination of cognitive psychology and neurophysiology offers a model for somatic pathology, and, perhaps more important, also for the understanding of subjective complaints and illness.",

      "title": "Trauma as a life event and its impact on suicidal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "abstract": "Stiff person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder associated with episodic muscle spasms, which could resulting in falling down and restriction of movements. They are especially sensitive to sudden sounds, stimulation, stressful events, which all of them result in muscle spasm. We described a 40 year old educated man who was diagnosed as stiff person syndrome since 3 years ago when had fell down during an important meeting. He receives IVIG and 60 mg diazepam as a treatment regimen. He referred to psychiatric clinic due to his nocturnal panic episodes. Regarding the case we want to investigate psychological problems in this rare syndrome. Rarity of disease make discussion and researches difficult, its prevalence is one individual among one million, so the analysis of patients’ history may be the best way of study. Phobias may be the most important disorders in these patients, as any noxious stimuli could provoke sever spasms, so patient may consciously automatically avoid specific situations such as steps, street, toilet etc. Avoidance could make patient phobic of being alone and being dependent on others. Patient may also experience degree of frustration and then often aggression toward others especially relatives. Depression anxiety and panic are other problems could be raised. The patient may think, the do not understand the situation. Rare syndromes potentially are accompanied by variety of psychological problems which should be tried to be understood and solved.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive medical evaluation includes a thorough history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory, imaging and other studies. An important portion of the history in a primary care evaluation is the psychiatric history and the mental status examination. When evaluating a patient for mental or emotional disorders, history is truly everything. Often, the practitioner must ask specific questions to assess the presence of common mental disorders in order to supplement other information or because the patient does not recognize or does not volunteer the symptoms. Casting ones net for the symptoms of common mental disorders, including the category of anxiety disorders, is extremely helpful to fully assess a patient’s emotional and physical status. Disorders that comorbidly occur may further complicate matters, especially if common symptoms are shared. For example, shared symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder include worrying, poor concentration, insomnia, fatigue, irritability, and somatic concerns. An appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan can be instituted only after the clinical symptoms and signs are fully recognized and evaluated. The information in this book is applicable to evaluations of adult patients, age 18 years or older, although sections may be applicable to younger patients. The information is based on scholarly information supported by research and practical suggestions based on cumulative clinical experiences of the authors.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are thought to be one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in children/adolescents. Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.",

Solitary confinement and prolonged sleep deprivation are just two examples of these psychological torture methods. Even psychological methods which do not amount to ill-treatment when considered in isolation, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment or torture, when applied in conjunction with other techniques, cumulatively and/or over a long time. Often they are part and parcel of the whole torture process and constitute a “background environment” of harassment and duress. The “cumulation over time” factor must thus be considered as part of a system of psychological torture.",

The condition can manifest itself in several ways and can be triggered in different scenarios, facts that render it a peculiar and multifaceted clinical entity. Nosologically, insomnia can be understood as a symptom or as a disorder with its own characteristics and has a chronic course. Insomnia disorder is more common among women and older adults, as well as in social risk strata, and is usually associated with comorbidities, particularly mental disorders. The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder have changed as new perspectives emerge. The cause-based classification (e.g., secondary to clinical diseases; associated with poor sleep hygiene) was abandoned in the latest editions of clinical manuals, which combined the subdivisions into a single entity, insomnia disorder. There are varied pathophysiological mechanisms that involve physiological and psychological features. The chronification of insomnia is more easily understood based on psychosocial models, especially Spielman's model that explains the development and maintenance of insomnia based on predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The most recent challenge is to determine new clinical phenotypes that allow a more assertive approach and treatment.",

When any or all of these factors are disrupted by a progressive dementia it is unsurprising that sexual ‘problems’ are identified. Most sexual behaviour ‘problems’ relate to expressions of normal sexuality complicated by changes in relationships, care needs and cognitive function, and complex ethical and legal considerations emerge. Rarely, new and severe hypersexual or paraphilic behaviours arise de novo , usually due to damage to certain brain areas, and sometimes due to medication side-effects, psychiatric disorder or delirium. Evidence and approaches to assess and to manage sexual behaviour problems in dementia are discussed.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

      "title": "[LOW BACK PAIN AT NEW WORKING AMBIENT IN ERA OF NEW ECONOMY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL RISK FACTORS].",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is the second most common symptom-related reason for physician visits and the first reason of working disability. Low back pain is a ubiquitous complaint, with particularly high prevalence among people in their working years (67%). For many individuals, episodes of back pain are self-limited and resolve without specific therapy. For others, however, back pain is recurrent or chronic, causing significant pain that interferes with employment and quality of life. Many occupations have been anecdotally linked to certain low back pain syndrome. However, the relationship between the work environment and the patient's symptoms, though clearly perceived by the patient to be causative, may be less certain. The injury model of an occupational disorder proposes that specific work activities are the cause of the patient's pain. The injury model for low back pain; implicating a causal connection with specific work activities, is complex and controversial. Determining whether a patient's low back pain is a consequence of his or her occupational activity, and how best to treat symptoms to maximize functionality and potential for a return to full employment capacity, can be challenging. In this systematic review which included patients/employees with low back pain, the following databases were searched: Pub Med, Embase, Medline and Web of science. The role of occupational mechanical exposure e.g. lifting as a risk factors for low back surgery has been debated for several decades. Diagnostic uncertainty exists even for those with back symptoms and well-described findings on scan, as these findings are common even in subjects without back pain, and may be unrelated to the symptoms. As an example, herniated disks can be identified in significant numbers of CT or MRI low back studies in subjects with no back pain. In further analysis, lifestyle factors and occupational psychosocial exposures will be addressed. Many physicians, including those practicing in primary care settings where back pain is most often seen, lack training and confidence in addressing workplace issues. Occupational factors that have a significant influence on the development of low back pain disorders are not only mechanical and postural order but also organisational, social and psychological. Organisational changes and physical and psychological job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistant impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). There is some evidence that catastrophizing as a stress coping strategy might lead to delayed recovery. Long-term work (sick) absence can be estimated through evaluation and observation of LBP risks and characteristics of the each individual case. An early return at workplace and to activities of daily life is urgent. To reduce LBS and its consequences, employers need to adopt a multifaced approach: concentrate on improving physical conditions as well as the psychosocial and environmental aspects of working environment. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation and occupational rehabilitation interventions (occupational reintegration) should be provided.",

Although many of these patients will be satis ed with negative medical examination results, a signi cant subgroup will anxiously continue to worry about the possibility of su ering from a yet undiagnosed physical disease-a phenomenon known as somatization. Somatization denotes the presence of physical symptoms (e.g., chest pain) for which no demonstrable disease process or bodily oriented pathology can be identi ed as the cause. ese individuals are likely to continue to seek help for their physical symptoms, demand more physical examinations and specialist referrals, undergo costly laboratory tests, and in rare cases, even end up on an operating table (Harth & Hermes, 2007; Warwick & Salkovskis, 1990). At the extreme, such somatization behavior can interfere with life activities and goals, resulting in clinically signi cant impairment-a phenomenon typically classi ed as somatization disorder. Yet, somatization processes frequently occur in other \"somatic disorders,\" including hypochondriasis, pain disorder, conversion disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, as well as many other psychiatric conditions (e.g., panic disorder, major depressive disorder).",

      "abstract": "If an hysterical patient went to a physician in the late nineteenth century, chances were the diagnostic focus would be on the somatic symptomatology.The patient exhibiting hysterical blindness or paralysis was treated by an ophthalmologist or neurologist, who looked for pathological evidence of disease, deterioration, or damage.These procedures signaled a triumph over an earlier view that perceived hysteria as a largely female complaint in which a woman's uterus detached itself and floated about throughout her body.l With the work of Charcot, Janet, and especially Freud, hysteria came to be appreciated as an anxiety reaction whose pathological locus was emotional, not physiological, and was therefore not restricted to women.Today popular wisdom recognizes that certain cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms originate with severe psychological stress.Nevertheless, the attraction persists for accepting the manifest sign or symptom as the most accurate measure of mental and physical health.There is an obvious need to grapple with manifest behavior.But in some instances the more accurate interpretation of behavior is to be found in latent material.The word \"hysteria\" in ordinary usage denotes the loss of self-control and a diminished if not total incapacity for rational and logical thinking.Hysterical individuals therefore represent chaos, disorder, and a loss of reality testing.Yet the hysterical individual may also represent a complicated organization in which the overt symptoms of emotional collapse serve to conceal personality deficits and conflicts.Where the outward impression presented by the hysterical individual may seem disorderly, it may also signify a series of psychologically defensive maneuvers designed to maintain a distorted but nevertheless cohesive internal sense of order.In history the crowd has often been likened to the hysterical individual.In his celebrated nineteenth-century study, Gustave Le Bon included the following in his convictions about crowd behavior: \"It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of crowds there Mazon_3241.",

      "title": "Sopite syndrome: a sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness.",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

      "abstract": "Functional disorders are clinical entities corresponding to complaints mimicking diseases without a clearly identified organic substrate despite a rigorous history and clinical examination. Sometimes, complementary examinations are necessary to rule out an organic lesion that could explain the symptomatology. The notion of a diagnosis of exclusion is therefore very present. The physician must constantly re-evaluate the diagnosis of functional disorder in order not to «miss» a diagnosis with an organic cause.The treatment of these functional disorders is sometimes based on psychological treatment when a psychogenic dimension seems to be involved. This is not always the case. In such cases it is necessary to be able to consider a placebo approach with the hope that the placebo effect may improve the patient's condition. This article discusses the placebo effect in functional disorders without omitting to address ethical and philosophical considerations.Les troubles fonctionnels sont des entités cliniques correspondant à des plaintes mimant des maladies sans substrat organique clairement identifié, malgré une anamnèse et un examen clinique rigoureux.

Le praticien se doit de réévaluer sans cesse le diagnostic de trouble fonctionnel afin de ne pas «passer à côté» d’un diagnostic avec une cause organique. Le traitement de ces troubles fonctionnels repose parfois sur une prise en charge psychologique lorsqu’une dimension psychogène semble incriminée. Ce n’est pas toujours le cas.

      "abstract": "What is the evolution of hysteria, now that the spectacular crises of previous times tend to occur less frequently? Are hysterical manifestations disappearing or do they take other forms? This question raises semantic and phenomenological problems concerning hysteria. A review of the literature shows the complexity and precariousness of some definitions, the question raised by associated organic disorders and the compounding influences of other nosological entities, such as depression and psychosomatic disorders. Clinical histories from the records of a psychiatric hospital for the period 1910-1929 were compared with those for the period 1970-1980. The results of the study were surprising with respect to the similarity of epidemiological profiles. If it can be concluded that hysterical manifestations are not disappearing, then the study confirms the evolution of symptomatology which, especially in women, takes atypical forms of depressive, neurovegetative or psychosomatic disorders. In males, hysterical symptoms are of a more acute nature and frequently occur in dependent, immature or infantile personalities, whilst in the past they were more chronic and frequently associated with more serious personality disorders.",

      "title": "Psychodiagnostics as a mandatory element of patient protocols in dentistry",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The psycho-emotional status of patients requiring dental treatment is severely affected by constant stress.[1] Stress is associated with visible or perceived defects that disrupt the patient's image: difficulties in articulating words during chewing or communicating with other people. The severity of such a stressful condition depends on several factors. Among these are the type of nervous activity, characteristics of the patient's perception of their image, social environment and social reaction to the patient's appearance, patient's assessment of their own condition, and the dentist's attitude toward the patient's psycho-emotional state.[2] Many unsuccessful dental interventions occur primarily due to the negative emotional mood of patients; however, they also deal with the discomfort that they experience both during and after the dental procedure. That is exacerbated by increasing stress, anxiety, and psycho-emotional tension or exhaustion, diminishing the positive effect of dental treatment.[3] Further, numerous research works observed possible changes in the normal functioning of the patient's body, namely, in pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate values.[456] These are visible in the results of studies when the ECG was performed during dental surgery.[7] Such deviations might also have the opposite effect. Thus, psycho-emotional stress leads to a delay in the grafting process. Changes in the nervous and endocrine systems can cause certain disturbances in the hemostatic system.[8] High emotional tension is also known to cause a specific contraction of the skeletal musculature of the face, which results in a manifestation of a local vascular response.[9] Another psycho-emotional trait that characterizes patients with dental problems is the anticipation of pain far before the start of the surgery. Some particularly sensitive patients can experience serious emotional trauma, even during simple dental procedures such as dental extraction. Fear can occur at the anesthesia stage, and the patient's body is then characterized by an increase in energy expenditure, which exceeds energy production. Psycho-emotional stress results in a 17% increase in oxygen consumption on average, triggering anaerobic glycolysis. This process, in turn, is a precursor to acidosis, leading to tissue hypoxia and a delayed reparation process. Increased anxiety is the cause of maladaptation and the appearance of neuropsychic disorders, as well as a slower recovery rate after surgery.[10] Psychodiagnosis is, thus, a necessary element of dental treatment. The use of dental questionnaires contributes to the selection of appropriate tactics for interaction between the physician and the patient. In this case, the questionnaires both before and after patients' dental treatment appear necessary. Comparing the results of the pretreatment and posttreatment questionnaire provides good insights into the effectiveness of dental treatment. As there are relatively few studies of this type to date, it appears necessary and relevant to conduct them. In order to adequately assess patient satisfaction with the quality of dental care provided, specialized questionnaires may be helpful, in addition to traditional methods of psycho-emotional analysis.[11] They contain dental questions that are relevant to both the dentist and the patient.[12] Once these questionnaires have been analyzed, the right tactics for patient rehabilitation can be selected.[13] A logical construction of such an analysis is the study of changes in the values of indicators of the patient's psychological state both before and after dental intervention.[14] Such an analysis is a reliable measure of the effectiveness and quality of dental care provided.[1516] Further, these studies appear necessary as they may contribute to the improvement of dental service quality. This study aims at performing a comparative analysis of the psycho-emotional condition of patients both before and after dental surgery. The objectives of the study were: (a) to examine the psycho-emotional state of patients with removable constructions; (b) similarly, to examine the state of patients with fixed constructions. MATERIALS AND METHODS MATERIALS The study was conducted in the Russian Federation in 2019–2020; it addressed data on patients from three dental clinics (two clinics from the Moscow city [Dental Clinic No. 62 of the Moscow City Health Department and Dental Clinic No. 12 of the Moscow City Health Department] and one clinic from the Perm city [City Dental Clinic No. 1]). The study involved a total of 600 patients divided into three groups. The patients' age ranged from 22 to 63 years, with a mean age of 42.0 ± 5.5 years. The average age and the number of men and women in each group are shown in Table 1.Table 1: Gender composition and average age of patients in the three groupsThe number of men and women in each group was similar (P ≥ 0.05; Table 1). The age of patients within each group and between groups also had no significant differences. The first group consisted of 200 patients with fixed dentures (metal-ceramic, used up to 3 years); the second group included patients with removable devices (200 patients); and the control group comprised 200 patients with healthy teeth. The dental procedures were provided under local anesthesia. STUDY DESIGN The Fere method was applied to estimate the predominant activity of the hemispheres. A scheme included three components: a current source and its amplifier (15 mAm) + silver electrodes (S = 2 cm2) + ohmmeter. Parameters of this skin-galvanic reaction were taken from two fingers of the right and left hands. Parameters on different hands were measured separately, first on the left hand and then on the right hand. Low resistance values at the moment of data acquisition allowed concluding the right hemisphere dominance in the patient's mental and emotional spheres and the corresponding emotional manifestations, namely, aggression, negative emotions, and increased anxiety. On the left side, the same data indicated the dominance of the left hemisphere with the corresponding emotions—satisfaction and positive emotions. Afterward, a bilateral asymmetry of hemispheric activity was calculated, when the left-hand indicators were divided by the right-hand indicators. The index value equaling to one was considered to be a physiological norm. Thus, the activity of the hemispheres was balanced. This study was conducted following international ethical and moral standards (the Helsinki Declaration of 1975). When working with patients, their written consent to data processing was obtained. Anonymity and confidentiality of information were preserved. RESEARCH METHODS Levels of anxiety and pain were determined by using a questionnaire. For this purpose, a generally accepted scale of patients' self-assessment of anxiety by Spielberger and Hanin and a Universal Pain Assessment Tool were applied. This test adequately reflects personal and reactive anxiety, estimating it as a constant characteristic of a personality. The advantage of the test is its validity and informativeness in the self-assessment of anxiety levels. The test includes two blocks corresponding to the level of reactive (questions 1 to 20) and personal (questions 21 to 40) anxiety. Reactive anxiety was calculated following the formula P = (A1 − A2) + 50, where A1 is the sum of 3–4, 6–7, 9, 12–14, and 18 items of the anxiety level scale, and A2 is the sum of items 1–2, 5, 8, 10, 15, and 19–20. Similarly, the level of personal anxiety was calculated using the formula L = (A1 − A2) + 35, in which A1 corresponds to the sum of items from questions 22 to 25 inclusive, questions 28 and 29, 31 and 32, also questions 34 and 35, questions 37 to 39 inclusive, and A2 is the sum of items from the remaining questions. Pain level was interpreted on a scale from 0 to 10 or by monitoring the patient's behavior. Each patient also filled out a questionnaire designed to express their opinion about the quality of dental treatment received. The questionnaire included questions on the patient's assessment of their teeth condition and their opinion on how the treatment affected their health and various aspects of life. The list of questions also included social aspects of the patient's life and, from the patient's point of view, the necessity and obligation of visiting the dentist. RESEARCH ALGORITHM The study was performed in the following way. First, a testing of Fere's skin-galvanic reaction was performed. Then, each of the patients filled out a quality-of-life questionnaire developed by the authors. Pain assessment was performed during the dental procedure under local anesthesia. Afterward, the skin-galvanic reaction readings were taken again, and the Spielberger-Hanin Scale questionnaire was administered. The Anxiety Scale questionnaire was offered once since in case of repeated completion, the patient may deliberately change the answers following his/her momentum opinion that the wrong answer was chosen at the beginning. The aim was to capture the possible relationship between questions about dental health and changes in anxiety levels. The algorithm allows establishing a clear psychodiagnostic of the patient's psychic state after the dental procedure, in particular, to reveal any changes in anxiety scores after the received therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The data were processed using Statistica v. 6.0. A two-sample t-test for independent samples was used to detect the significance of differences. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05. The distribution of features corresponded to normal, allowing for the establishment of Pearson's correlations. Tables 1–3 show arithmetic mean values for each parameter and the error of the mean.Table 2: Psychodiagnostics results of patients with healthy teeth (control group) before and after the survey about the condition of teethTable 3: Characteristics of psycho-emotional condition in patients from Group 1 (fixed metal-ceramic dentures) before and after evaluation of dental statusRESULTS For the control group, the asymmetry hemispheric activity index in 81 patients was within unity, which corresponded to a state of equilibrium. For another 69 patients, this index was less than unity, which corresponded to positive mood and the dominance of the left hemisphere. Finally, in 60 patients, the coefficient exceeded unity, which corresponded to dominance of the right hemisphere and negative emotional mood [Table 2]. In the control group, significant differences were established only for female patients. In both groups, with equilibrium and negative hemispheric activity index, the differences between the values before and after treatment were significant toward a 1.1-fold increase [Table 2]. The other indicators, particularly in the male group, did not differ from those in the control one. A direct correlation was established between the score in the dental status questionnaire and the emotions with which the patient filled out the questionnaire. This correlation was more pronounced in women (0.72; P ≤ 0.05) compared with men, namely, 0.72 vs. 0.57 at P ≤ 0.05, respectively. Consequently, the emotional state of the patients can influence the answers in the dental status questionnaire. There was also a direct correlation between the score growth in the questionnaire and the values of the hemispheric activity index after the survey, namely, 0.75 (P ≤ 0.05) for women and 0.64 (P ≤ 0.05) for men. Thus, the questions of the survey itself can have a significant influence on the patients' emotional state. At the same time, no statistically significant correlation between anxiety scores and the results of the dental status questionnaire were recorded for the control group. For patients from the second group with removable dentures, the hemispheric activity index corresponded to unity in 83 patients, that is, was equilibrium; in 48 patients, it was less than unity, that is, the left hemisphere and positive emotions dominated; and in the remaining 69 patients, the index exceeded unity, that is, the right hemisphere and negative emotions dominated. However, after a survey about dental health, the following changes were observed: 55 patients reported a state of equilibrium, 37 patients had positive emotional disposition, and the remaining 108 had a negative empathy. Significant changes were also obtained for the hemispheric activity index after the dental status survey, namely a 1.3-fold in men with the positive emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), a 2.2-fold in women with the negative emotional disposition (P ≤ 0.01), and a 2.1-fold in men from the same group (P ≤ 0.01). Also, a direct correlation between the increase of patients' questionnaire scores and their emotional state was recorded: 0.70 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.79 for men (P ≤ 0.05). These results indicate the influence of the patient's emotional state on the questionnaire results. After the survey, however, this relationship intensified in Group 2, and the correlation between the scores and hemispheric activity factor was 0.88 for women (P ≤ 0.05) and 0.91 for men (P ≤ 0.05). In contrast to the control group, there was also a correlation between the anxiety level and score growth rates. Thus, for personal anxiety in men, the Pearson's correlation was 0.84 for both genders (P ≤ 0.05), whereas the reactive anxiety index amounted to 0.78 for women and 0.81 for men (P ≤ 0.05). The increasing level of anxiety indicates a negative influence of responses about dental treatment, which is also illustrated by the increasing number of patients with a negative emotional empathy in Group 2. Patients in Group 1 had a similar emotional state distribution compared with Group 2 before completing the dental status questionnaire. Thus, 87 had an equilibrium status with index values around unity, 68 were positive, and 43 were negative [Table 3]. After the patients answered the questions about dental health, the ratio of subgroups with different emotional moods changed in favor of the negative one. Hence, there were 80 people in an equilibrium state, 63 were positively inclined, and 57 had a negative emotional disposition [Table 3]. This indicates a tendency for the negative emotional mood to increase after the survey on dental status. Significant changes in the hemispheric activity coefficient both before and after treatment were noted for men with positive mood (a 1.1-fold increase, P ≤ 0.01), for women with negative mood (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05), and for men from the same group (a 1.2-fold increase, P ≤ 0.05). There was a direct correlation between the increased scores and emotional disposition among men and women in Group 1, namely 0.72 and 0.73, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Also, a correlation was established between the value of the hemispheric activity factor and the increased scores after the survey was recorded, namely, 0.82 for men and 0.81 for women (P ≤ 0.05). A correlation between an increase in the scores and the values of personal anxiety for men and women was 0.57 and 0.66, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). For reactive anxiety, these indices were 0.56 and 0.57 for men and women, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). As a result, patients in Groups 1 and 2 with removable and fixed dentures differ in anxiety levels. This confirms the hypothesis that the results of the dental health survey generally have a negative impact on the psycho-emotional status of the patient, especially when the local type of anesthesia is used. DISCUSSION This study showed that after the survey on dental status and quality of life was conducted, a significant increase in the hemispheric activity index values was noted among patients in the groups with removable and fixed dentures demonstrated. Hence, the emotional state of the patients changed toward the negative in both groups in general. These changes affected most patients with negative emotional mood prior to the administration of the questionnaire. There was also a dependence on the type of dentures. In Group 2 (with removable dentures), the increase in negative emotions was more pronounced, with the indices of anxiety varying more in male patients. Thus, the survey results can be used to perform a psychodiagnostic of the patient's emotional condition. If the patient scored up to 18 points on the survey, it can be stated that he or she is satisfied with the dental treatment provided. When the number of points ranges from 18.0 to 29.0, the patient can be considered as only partially satisfied with the quality of dental care provided. If a patient scores more than 29 points based on the test results, it can be assumed that they are not satisfied with the dental treatment performed. The behavioral response of patients under local anesthesia in the first group suggested a moderate level of pain. According to the results on the hemispheric activity index, the indicators of negative emotional mood worsened 1.2 times (P ≤ 0.05) for men and women in the group with fixed dentures; however, in the group with removable dentures, this tendency was stronger with 2.2 and 2.1 times, accordingly (P ≤ 0.01). These results are supported by the increased level of anxiety in patients with removable and fixed dentures. No emotional changes were found in any of the controls. The significance of differences between the groups according to the survey results was confirmed by statistical tests and established correlations between the emotional mood and the increase in scores. Among the study limitations, the factor of gender belonging (significant differences obtained for men and women) and the state of the patient's psyche should be particularly considered. In cases where the patient's mental condition may deviate from generally accepted norms (i.e., phobias), the test results may not adequately correspond to the patient's real psycho-emotional state. This was demonstrated in a study that evaluated the stress level of patients with epilepsy during dental procedures.[17] Data from questionnaires administered to 85 patients with epilepsy before elective dental surgery were considered. Dental anxiety was found in 17.6% of patients (n = 15). At the same time, dental anxiety did not correspond to factors such as age, level of education, type of epilepsy, frequency of attacks, use of antiepileptics, and many others. However, a significant correlation was found between gender (P < 0.01) and the type of oral surgery (removal of a retained third molar; P < 0.05) on the one hand and the level of dental anxiety on the other. Similar results were reported in other studies.[1819] A relationship to the gender factor was also established in this study. Results from this study are generally consistent with similar research. Thus, using data on 105 patients (aged 18–23 years) of dental clinics, it was found that different groups demonstrated various anxiety levels expressed in dentophobia and salivary pH changes.[20] Group 1 demonstrated a low level of anxiety and consisted of 33 patients (31.4%). Group 2 included 32 patients (30.5%) with moderate anxiety levels; however, in Group 2 with 40 patients (38.1%), a high anxiety level was recorded.[20] Of the 105 study participants, 85% showed low levels of dentophobia, 27% demonstrated low levels of anxiety, 29% showed moderate anxiety levels, and 28% showed high levels of anxiety. The mean salivary pH of all participants was 6.79 at rest and 6.43 in anxiety.[20] Thus, saliva pH may also be a factor worth considering in such studies. Another study showed that microcirculatory changes can indicate psycho-emotional stress development.[21] The study included 30 patients. The control group consisted of patients without psycho-emotional disorders but with postprosthetic complications after dental implantation. The results obtained showed that the capillary blood flow during stress changes at both oscillatory and nonoscillatory levels. At vasodilatation, an intensification of blood flow and disruption of venous flow was established. Analysis of high- and low-frequency oscillations by wavelet transformations revealed an increase in endothelium activity and a decrease in sympathetic adrenergic vasomotor and precapillary tone. Psycho-emotional stress is, therefore, mostly caused by a physiological factor. The patient's consciousness in dental clinic is a comprehensive relationship with the stimuli received from external and internal receptors. Through the interaction of these receptors, the consciousness forms a kind of emotional background, reflecting the patient's perception of the physical condition.[22232425] Besides, all of the patient's perceptions or experiences about their condition are reflected in the way they relate to their health.[26] In general, such patients can be divided into three groups: with a dismissive attitude, with an adequate attitude, and finally, the group with increased attention to their health.[16] Other data indicate that a negative emotional background is influenced by factors, such as the patient's intelligence, the intensity of pain, and the severity of the ongoing disease or upcoming dental procedure.[2728] Thus, research into the patient's emotional activity type plays an important role in subsequent dental treatment. The predominance of negative emotions, such as irritability, demandingness, and the frustration of their physical sensations, constitute a significant proportion among character traits, which also affect the patient's social life.[29] It is known that among the patients who have agreed to treatment, feelings of fear and pain may increase even before the dental treatment starts. Fear may take different, and often opposing, forms, such as worry, euphoria, and anxiety. Of the techniques used, two approaches are dominant.[22] The first approach is clinical, consisting of analytical conversations with the patient and observing behavioral patterns. The second approach is a laboratory one, which is less costly in time and resources and implies the use of questionnaires. The most commonly used questionnaires are the Eysenck questionnaire, the MMPI, and the MMPI 2. Further, the Eysenck questionnaire links types of temperament, extraversion and introversion, as well as stability and instability. However, most of the questionnaires show different deficiencies. Some of them diagnose a small number of psychoypes, others are too cumbersome, and many do not include psychometric properties. CONCLUSION This study showed that changes in the hemispheric activity index and indicators of personal and reactive anxiety are related to the survey results on the dental status and the type of dental service provided. By the quality-of-life criteria, the values obtained were different according to the emotional mood of the patient. It follows that obtaining reliable information about the patient's satisfaction with the dental care provided, questionnaires on the patient's dental health status are required in addition to the standard psychodiagnostic techniques. The study and analysis of the data obtained allow for the right choice to restore the patient's physical and mental health after receiving dental care. Such a multicomponent approach can greatly enhance the quality of dental treatments and establish the most efficient methods. These results are confirmed by the heightened level of anxiety in patients in groups with removable and fixed prostheses. No change of emotional mood was noted in controls.

      "title": "CHRONIC PAIN IN SURVIVORS OF TORTURE – Psyche or Soma?",
      "abstract": "Persistent pain related to the musculo-skeletal system is the most frequent reported physical complaint in survivors of torture. In spite of a long-standing tradition of multidisciplinary rehabilitation, however, there is no consensus on how chronic pain and pain-related disability are best addressed within this clinical practice. Are pain problems in torture survivors to be viewed as a somatic problem and intensively investigated and managed as such, or assumed to be the presentation/concomitant of psychological disturbance such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other trauma-related problem? The current paper is intended as an overview of chronic pain in torture survivors viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate theoretical models of pain. According to these models pain should be viewed not as the result of either solely physical or solely psychological causes, but rather as a set of bio-physiological, psychosocial and behavioural factors contributing to the total experience of pain. Consequently, appropriate assessment of chronic pain requires assessment of more than just the direct components of pain. Given the complexity inherent in the construct of subjective pain, there is a need to obtain a diversity of assessment information that must then be integrated to understand the individuals’ pain and to contribute to treatment decision-making. Overemphasising the importance of psychological aspects, however, may result in insufficient somatic pain diagnoses and reduced treatment efficacy. Basic knowledge of the physiology of pain is therefore a prerequisite when assessing, diagnosing, and managing individuals suffering from chronic pain conditions. A brief introduction to the physiology of pain has therefore been enclosed in this paper, focusing on chronic, persistent pain and the pain signalling system under abnormal conditions. Possible pain generating mechanisms in chronic post-torture pain are highlighted and how to use clinical information and an understanding of pain classification to identify these mechanisms. Clinically, a failure to appreciate the intricacies of the relation and co-occurrence of trauma-related problems and chronic pain carries a risk of poor clinical decision-making, selection for treatment, and design of therapeutic intervention. It is advocated that chronic post-torture pain should be viewed from the perspectives offered by the interactive and multivariate models of pain and stress, and that knowledge-based clinical guidelines for the assessment and interdisciplinary management emphasising biomedical, behavioural, and cognitive aspects of chronic pain and pain-associated disability in torture survivors should be developed based on these models.",

      "abstract": "A variety of subjective illnesses with few or no objective findings have appeared at regular intervals as epidemics in our society under different labels. There are few or no objective findings that might explain the \"disease\" or the complaints go beyond what is regarded as \"reasonable\" by the physician. Muscle pain and other types of subjective health complaints are among the most frequent reason for encounters with general practitioners, and one of the major causes for sickness absence. The prevalence of subjective health complaints is very high, with at least 75% of the population reporting one or more subjective health complaints the past 30 days. From a statistical point of view, it is \"normal\" to have complaints. It is when they become intolerable that assistance is required. The difficult thing is that this threshold is individual and subjective. The psychiatric definitions of these complaints, therefore, refer only to the tip of an iceberg.",

      "title": "Issues of occupational fatigue",
      "abstract": "Purpose: The paper deals with the issues of occupational fatigue. One of the features of the work model adopted in recent years is that employees work more than forty hours a week. This results in greater fatigue, which over time may turn into severe fatigue. Then we cannot cope with our work tasks and we are also mentally less resistant to various types of stressful situations, which deepens the feeling of fatigue and exhaustion. Chronically tired people usually suffer from insomnia, which deepens problems with the already disturbed circadian rhythm and does not allow us to have a sufficient rest. Strong and constant fatigue, described as exhaustion, is a signal that your body needs some rest. Chronic fatigue may also indicate the presence of a disease. The purpose of this paper is to highlight this very important problem. Design/methodology/approach: Literature research of the subject was carried out. Findings: They fatigue also increase the risk of accidents, defects or mistakes at work. Fatigue itself is not a disease, but only a symptom. According to general practitioners, chronic fatigue, which persists for no apparent reason, is currently one of the most common health problems reported by their patients. Unfortunately, diagnosing and treating this condition is not easy due to the large number of possible causes and risk factors. Practical implications: The issues discussed in this paper significantly affect the improvement of methods related to work environment management and the desired shaping of employees’ attitudes and behavior regarding the approach to the problem of being tired at work, a problem related to work environment that has been downplayed so far. Originality/value: A holistic approach to the issues of occupational fatigue. Defining it as an interdisciplinary problem. It should be dealt with by doctors of various specialties, especially in occupational medicine, of course, but also general practitioners, neurologists, gastroenterologists, and cardiologists. It also requires the attention of non-medical specialists, including psychologists and physiologists. Keywords: company management, occupational fatigue, human factor.

      "title": "Double diagnosis and forensic psychiatric opinion",
      "abstract": "Addiction to alcohol or any other psychoactive substance can run parallel with other diseases or mental disorders. One can then observe co-occurrence and mutual interaction of dysfunctions typical of addiction and of other mental disorders that accompany addiction. That is why, clinical pictures of such states (double diagnosis) are usually less unique, have an unusual course and cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty. The problem of forensic psychiatric opinion and treatment of people with a double diagnosis is another aspect of these difficulties. It is caused by the fact that forensic psychiatric assessment of the mental state of such people requires taking into consideration a very complex clinical and legal situation triggered by the interference of various ethiopathogenetic and clinical disorders. It leads to the need for complex evaluation and reference to sanity or other signs of functioning within the current law should result, first of all, from the analyses directly pertaining to the influence of the diagnosed disorders on the state of patients with double diagnosis. The forensic psychiatric aspect of disorders connected with double diagnosis is particularly significant as there is a relatively high risk of behaviours posing a threat to public order in this group of patients.",

A chronic illness has a lengthy duration, uncertain outcome, and unpredictable episodes, often with intrusive symptoms and intermittent or progressive disability. Having a chronic illness poses life problems such as following a medical regimen, managing ordinary responsibilities, and experiencing stigma and discrimination. A disease, in contrast, may remain silent for years without eliciting a diagnosis or causing noticeable symptoms and life disruptions. Experiencing chronic illness makes disease real. Sociological definitions of chronic illness start with the experience of disruption and impairment. Social definitions of disability start from the lack of societal accommodation to certain individuals’ needs, thereby disadvantaging them and discriminating against them. Such definitions of disability tend to presuppose that the people involved have static, visible conditions with predictable and sustained needs.",

It can also lead to ‘somatic fixation’: an overemphasis on physical symptoms and investigations while avoiding personal and psychological issues.6\n\nSomatisation can often be a positive diagnosis, rather than by exclusion.5 Diagnosis at the first consultation is possible by asking specific questions to identify common patterns of somatising illness.

The\r\n traumatic event for every man is sudden, unexpected, embarrassing, and in such events the\r\n person is never ready. Every hour, someone becomes a victim of violence, a victim of a\r\n psychological trauma, either directly or as a witness.

If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis. The quality of life and health is\r\n impaired. The person is no longer the same as before or before the trauma. It best recognizes and\r\n finds his family suffering the most. Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs.

      "title": "Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: Symptomatology in Drug Induced Psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) is a severely under-studied mental disorder, regardless of being relatively as prevalent as other serious mental illnesses (SMI) to the general population, such as schizophrenia and obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD). Due to the nature of the current body of work on the disorder, it's clear there is a need for further research, as there are only a few small scale studies that approach the contradistinction in symptomatology between varying onset triggers. This paper proposes an investigation into whether there is a distinction in severity, duration, and persistence of symptoms between individuals with DPDR triggered by drugs versus non-drug induced cases. The proposed study hypothesizes that symptoms in drug induced individuals will be significantly different from cases induced by other triggers. The outcome of symptoms may depend on many factors, a few such as whether or not an individual continues to experiment with drugs following the development of DPDR, running the risk of re-exposing themselves to a severe episode, whether or not symptoms rooted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) retrigger dissociative episodes, and the potential of co-occurring hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) causing symptoms of perceptual disturbances. The proposed study will use a survey design to collect data from 175 participants, targeting individuals who are currently experiencing DPDR or DPDR-like symptoms, or have recovered from the disorder. Given that significant evidence of distinction is uncovered, this study may be the stepping stone to addressing and developing treatment options for DPDR sufferers in the future.",

The findings suggest that burnout can take place among representatives of older age and more it is continued, provided professional activities. The cessation of the work activities leads to stress, often with the subsequent development post-traumatic stress disorder and stress-induced diseases. However in this case the clinical symptoms of the syndrome of emotional burnout, does not disappear, but only happens their clinical transformation attach various psychosomatic disorders. Thus, the elderly, suffering the syndrome of emotional burnout, are at high risk group with regard to the formation and development of diseases, associated with stress and require close monitoring in the framework of the compulsory program of medical examination.В статье представлены результаты сравнительного исследования клинических проявлений синдрома эмоционального выгорания у 84 работающих по специальности врачей-терапевтов женщин пожилого возраста и 48 официально прекративших работу по данной специальности. Полученные данные указывают на то, что синдром эмоционального выгорания может иметь место у лиц пожилого возраста, и он более всего связан с продолжающейся профессиональной деятельностью. Прекращение данной трудовой деятельности приводит к стрессу, нередко с последующим развитием посттравматического стрессового расстройства и стресс-индуцированных заболеваний. При этом клинические проявления самого синдрома эмоционального выгорания не исчезают, а лишь трансформируются с присоединением различных психосоматических нарушений. Таким образом, пожилые, страдающие синдромом эмоционального выгорания, являются группой риска в отношении формирования и развития заболеваний, связанных со стрессом, и нуждаются в пристальном наблюдении в рамках обязательной программы диспансеризации.",

However, symptoms do not have a medical explanation but these are very real and not feigning the symptoms. It produces severe detrimental effects on patients’ daily functioning and social and occupational life like other mental illnesses. Severe distress and traumatic life circumstances are identified as the main causes of this illness, which are converted into symptoms in individuals. Patients showed ignorance of his symptoms even though these were severe and distressful which was called La-belle indifference. However, it was not shown by many patients, so it was removed from the diagnostic criteria of this illness. Dissociative conversion disorder is associated with many other mental health conditions like anxiety disorder and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy and psychoanalysis therapy are helpful in the treatment of this disorder.",

It can be seen in the elderly, arthritis, drug interaction checker, fibromyalgia, living healthy, lupus osteoarthritis, pill identifier, rheumatoid arthritis, sports injuries, etc. Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most common problems in sport injuries resulting loss of mobility and physical independence. Homoeopathic treatment schedule considers disease as a dynamic unit and the derangement of the whole man, expressed through the particular organs of the body, i.e. the ‘whole man’ is primarily diseased and individual organs/parts are only secondarily affected. It distinguishes each entity suffering from various or same diseases as different from others, because individuals are inimitable by virtue of their particular and peculiar mental and physical states, and characteristics. Concisely, it lays emphasis on, the ‘person diagnosis’, instead of the ‘disease diagnosis’. Therefore,” every diseases has a cure” is the believe of homoeopathy. Under this flow of homeopathy principle, the aim of this article is to present some of the most frequent musculoskeletal disorders in sports Injuries and their homoeopathic treatment schedule .Sports is an essential part of each nation. There are many ways to classify sports injuries based on the time taken for the tissues to become injured, tissue type affected, severity of the injury, and type of the injury occurred in the individual. Therefore, different homeopathic treatments are required to tackle different category of injury especially the outcomes of sport activities.

It is suggested that the extent of such injury is unrelated to the magnitude of shock current and that the timing of the ldquodiffuse electrical injuryrdquo may be indefinitely delayed with respect to the time of the sustained shock.

The typical course of a psychogenic epidemic at a workplace progresses from sudden onset, often with dramatic symptoms, to a rapidly attained peak that draws much publicity and is followed by quick disappearance of the symptoms. Over 90% of the affected persons are women, and the symptoms range from dizziness, vomiting, nausea, and fainting to epileptic-type seizures, hyperventilation, and skin disorders. The background mechanisms are thought to be generalized beliefs and triggering events which create a sense of threat that leads to a physiological state of arousal. This state, in turn, creates new beliefs which give meaning to the sense of arousal. The new belief spreads through sociometric channels. Predisposing factors include boredom, pressure to produce, physical stressors, poor labor-management relations, and impaired interpersonal communications, and lack of social support. It is important that a thorough investigation be carried out in all instances. Investigation is not only necessary for diagnosis, but it also reassures the management, the employees, and the press that physical factors are unlikely to be responsible for the disease.",

Die Ursachen liegen darin, dass psychiatrische Diagnosen auf Verhaltensbeobachtung und Beschwerdeschilderung gruenden, sie sind deswegen mitunter kaum zu objektivieren. Wegen den Schwierigkeiten in der Diagnosestellung ist fuer die Beurteilung von Schaedigungsfolgen weniger die Diagnose, als vielmehr der gesicherte Nachweis konkreter Funktionsstoerungen geeignet. Bei der Untersuchung ist der Gutachter weitgehend auf die Mitwirkung des Untersuchten angewiesen. Eingeschraenkte Kooperativitaet ist daher ein Problem erstrangiger Bedeutung. Aus einer Diagnose folgt nicht, dass ein bestimmtes Ausmass an Beeintraechtigung vorliegt. Deshalb ist es unumgaenglich, die Beeintraechtigungen als Befund konkret nachzuweisen, zu bezeichnen und ihre Auswirkungen auf den Einzelfall darzulegen. Psychische Folgeschaeden von Unfaellen setzen einen psychischen Erstschadensbefund voraus. Deren Vorliegen kann aus den Berichten der Erstbehandler, aus den Polizeiberichten oder aus Augenzeugenaussagen hervorgehen.

      "title": "Mental health disorders: prevalent but widely ignored in academia?",
      "abstract": "Considering that up to one in six persons worldwide has experienced a mental disorder within the past 12 months, and bearing in mind that about one-third of adults suffer from a clinically manifest mental disorder during their lifetime (Steel et al. 2014), every one of us is likely to regularly be in contact with people who have mental health problems. Does the same hold true for the academic population? Is it possible that mental disorders such as anxiety, depressive or substance use related disorders are even more common among scientists than in the general population, but still widely ignored? And if the answer to these questions is ‘Yes’, what implications should be taken into consideration? A mental disorder is a behavioural or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual, characterized by the following facts: it causes clinically significant distress and/or impairments in one or more important areas of functioning; is not merely an expectable response to common stressors and losses; reflects an underlying psychobiological dysfunction; is not solely a result of social deviance or conflicts with society; has diagnostic validity using one or more sets of diagnostic validators; and has clinical utility (Stein et al. 2010; APA, 2013; WHO, 2019). World Mental Health (WMH) representative community surveys provide information regarding the prevalence of common mental disorders. Those surveys are carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO) in many countries throughout the world, using the same fully-structured research diagnostic interview to generate diagnoses of mental disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (WHO, 2019) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (APA, 2013). According to those surveys, in the general population the most frequent mental disorders are anxiety and mood disorders (such as depression), with lifetime prevalence rates averaging approximately 16% (12-months prevalence 11%) for anxiety disorders, and 12% (12-months prevalence 6%) for mood disorders (Kessler et al. 2009). A meta-analysis suggests population-based lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates for having at least one mental disorder of 29% and 18%, respectively (Steel et al. 2014). Some authors argue that mental health problems in academia are widespread and constitute an ‘invisible crisis’ (Price et al. 2017; Bira et al. 2019). This point of view may reflect anecdotal evidence of life experiences, but to our knowledge there is limited systematic empirical research concerning mental health issues in postdoctoral researchers, research and teaching fellows, or professors. However, studies involving college, university or graduate students have brought heightened awareness of and attention to the topic (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005). Findings from large-scale WMH surveys with 1572 college students across 21 countries indicated that one-fifth of the sample suffered from at least one mental disorder during the year prior to assessment (assessed were mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, disruptive behaviour disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance use disorders) (Auerbach et al. 2016). It is noteworthy that these prevalence rates did not exceed those reported in two control groups of non-students in the same age range, specifically in participants who recently left college without graduating (n = 702; prevalence 25.0%) and in other non-students (n = 3476; prevalence 21.4%) (Auerbach et al. 2016). Across all groups, anxiety disorders were the most prevalent mental illnesses, followed by mood and substance use disorders. Findings from the WMH International College Student project indicate somewhat higher prevalence estimates among first year students (n = 13,984) from 19 colleges across eight countries. One-third screened positive for at least one 12-month mental disorder, most commonly depression, which was found in 18.5% of participants (Auerbach et al. 2018). Depression is characterized by a variety of symptoms that reduce the ability to meet study or work commitments, involving feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, or worthlessness; lack of interest in activities once enjoyed; fatigue; diminished ability to think or concentrate; and/or indecisiveness (APA, 2013). According to the WMH College Student project, only one in three students with depression received mental health treatment (Bruffaerts et al. 2019). This is worrisome, given that – apart from the symptoms mentioned above – thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are common during episodes of depression (APA, 2013). In terms of university students and junior researchers, there is accumulating evidence for a relatively high prevalence of mental disorders in this population, including medical students (Rosenthal & Okie, 2005; Levecque et al. 2017; Pacheco et al. 2017; Zeng et al. 2019). A Flemish study investigated 3659 graduate students enrolled in a PhD programme, using validated self-rating questionnaires. Roughly one-third of participants were identified as being at risk of having or developing a mental disorder, especially depression (Levecque et al. 2017). This estimate was 2.4 times higher in PhD students compared to highly educated individuals in the general population, 2.8 times higher compared to highly educated employees, and 1.8 times higher compared to higher education students (Levecque et al. 2017). A recent questionnaire-based online survey of 2279 graduate students (90% PhD students, 10% Master's students) from 26 countries and 234 institutions suggests an increased propensity towards anxiety (41%) and depressive disorders (39%) in the graduate trainee community that would be higher than in the general population (Evans et al. 2018). The study further showed that those participants who scored above the questionnaire thresholds for anxiety and/or depressive disorder more often disagreed with such statements as ‘I have a good work–life balance’ or evaluated their relationship with and support by their principal investigators or supervisors more harshly than participants with low anxiety/depression scores (Evans et al. 2018). It is worth noting that the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the convenience (non-representative) sample, the potential selection bias, the lack of a control group, and the use of self-ratings instead of structured clinical interviews conducted by mental health experts (Duffy et al. 2019). The findings reported above point to the need for a better understanding of mental health problems among academics. The usually high workload, often associated with externally prescribed deadlines, competition for research resources, and uncertain job prospects can have an adverse impact on mental health. Problems may be aggravated by poor management practice as well as insufficient recognition and reward (Gillespie et al. 2001). Besides possibly disadvantageous academic conditions, other variables might contribute to mental health problems among certain sub-populations. For example, we cannot exclude the possibility that people who seek an academic career are particularly vulnerable to developing mental health problems. Vice versa, scientists may possess certain personality features (e.g. openness, self-directedness) that may increase their resilience and protect them from mental health conditions (Sato, 2016). Unfortunately, there is a relative dearth of research on mental health among senior researchers. Knowing that graduate students appear to be at increased risk for poor mental health, one could assume that senior researchers are affected in a similar manner. However, it could also be that scientists at later career stages are less affected than junior researchers, due to the benefits of their positions such as a higher level of independence, job security, etc. Maybe the more resilient one is, the more likely one is to reach the level of senior researcher. However, such reasoning remains speculative, due to the lack of empirical data. The relationships between mental health and both favourable and unfavourable academic conditions are still understudied. A major problem is that most people with mental disorders suffer in silence. They may conceal or hide their mental health problems from others because of anticipated stigma, discrimination, potential damage of their careers, and concerns about confidentiality. This is a consequence of persisting negative attitudes towards persons with mental disorders, including inappropriate beliefs about the causes of mental illnesses (Wynaden et al. 2014). Negative attitudes are often related to insufficient literacy in a topic. Thanks to greater public awareness, the stigma surrounding mental disorders such as depression has been gradually decreasing in recent decades. Despite that progress, mental health problems are still frequently seen as a ‘weakness’ or ‘lack of willpower’, rather than as what they are: an illness. It is odd that mental disorders are not regarded in the same manner as somatic disorders, and that it would appear to be easier to openly talk about cancer than about depression. For the person afflicted, self-stigma hampers early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, which can result in terrible consequences. It is essential that we become more open and reflect more honestly about ourselves, regardless of whether we self-identify as being affected by mental health problems, or not. We should combat the stigma around psychiatric disorders in academic settings by paying more attention to possible mental health problems. There might be several reasons for the uncharacteristically poor work performance of a student or colleague, his or her cyclic lack in responses to emails, unexplained non-attendance, sudden indecisiveness and unreliability, etc. Mental health problems may constitute a potential reason, and while they should not be overestimated, they should be taken into account. Perpetuating negative attitudes towards poor mental health by making derogatory comments, spreading rumours about suspected mental issues of a colleague, or by maintaining a ‘don't ask, don't tell’ culture, are not appropriate. Instead, we should raise awareness, increase our mental health literacy, listen, speak out, seek or offer/point out help, and reduce attitudinal barriers on campus to better recognize and deal with mental health problems in academics.",

Each family of disorders is distinctive in presentation and requires diagnosis‐specific interventions. Because of the complex nature of these disorders, management approaches may not always eliminate symptoms and or completely restore patient function to a level found prior to symptom onset. As a consequence, ergonomic measures should be implemented to reduce the overload on tissue and contribute to patient recovery. However, functional limits may persist and the clinician must make further decisions regarding a person's functional status in the chronic stages of the patient's care.",

Prolonged coma calls for repeated clinical and laboratory examination. Combinations of causes, e.g. organ disease plus intoxication should be considered.",

Sometimes the cause of the patient's anxiety is obvious; often it is not. A patient with a fracture or one who has noticed gross blood in the stool is understandably disturbed. His anxiety often results in symptoms which are in addition to those of the underlying pathological process. Such anxieties, however, present little difficulty to the clinician. The symptoms are recognized for what they are and respond rapidly to reassurance, mild sedation, and effective treatment of the obvious disease or injury. On the other hand, many patients come with anxiety of more obscure cause. It may manifest itself as fatigue, nervousness, tenseness, headache, insomnia, indigestion, or a host of other symptoms. It is with this group that this paper is particularly concerned. Such patients are frequently seen by physicians engaged in the practice",

They may be mainly physical, and the patient may present with one or more of a bewildering number of somatic complaints, often blaming those for his change in mood (Watts, 1957). Pain is a common and diagnostically puzzling presenting symptom of depression and other psychiatric disorders (Walters, 1961). It may take the form of generalized or poorly localized aches and pains, often associated with a feeling of tension, or it may be sharply delimited (Critchley, 1935). This form of localized pain may so dominate the symptomatology that the patient is referred by his general practitioner to a variety of specialists, who may perform a series of special investigations or even exploratory operations. Clearly, every effort must be made to exclude organic disease, even if positive signs of psychiatric illness are recognized, as an organic disease can obviously co-exist with a psychiatric one.

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

The same and other similar situations are everyday experiences for modern humans (1), whose various responses may be psychological and/or physical. Since stress can be caused by environmental as well as psychological factors, it is easy to perceive that there is a relationship between everyday stress and defense mechanisms and disease susceptibility and that the physical and psychological spheres are often both involved in the process. The result is a unitary concept of human pathology, and the problem is to determine the entity of the emotional component in any disease.

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

L'apparition des symptomes ulcereux, les rechutes dans la maladie, a un moment precis de l'histoire du malade ne sont pas aleatoires. Elles correspondent souvent a la survenue d'evenements nouveaux, vecus comme traumatisants. Le deuil, les separations. . . , autant de situations stressantes induisant un malaise que le malade ne peut surmonter. Notons aussi cette problematique relationnelle, avec tout ce qu'elle connote comme ambivalence et tiraillement chez le malade qui n'arrive pas a trouver un compromis, lui permettant de surmonter ses conflits sans crainte de la perte ou de la rupture. La decharge emotionnelle etant barree, l'agressivite si elle existe, demeure retournee sur le malade lui-meme. Le malaise familial que vivent les patients se laisse voir a travers leurs difficultes relationnelles avec l'entourage et la situation embarassante dans laquelle ils se trouvent, sans aucune mediation possible par le langage concernant leurs problemes. Le discours parental culpabilisant fait vivre au patient un sentiment de rejet mal tolere. Il s'ajoute a cela la menace et la malediction qui suscitent l'angoisse. L'angoisse est aussi particulierement aigue devant la mort ou l'atteinte de la personne. Elle s'exprime dans la somatisation, faute de pouvoir etre symbolisee, elaboree dans la relation a l'autre. Le patient semble se retrancher a l'interieur de son propre corps ou moi, sans contact possible avec l'autre trop menacant et il est comme coupe de l'interieur. Il joue sa vie a travers la maladie, faute de pouvoir assumer la marque de l'autre en lui (le manque en lui-meme).",

The pathogenesis is multifactorial but is probably often due to changes in the autonomic nervous system, as well as to age-related changes in the cardiovascular and endocrine systems. In addition, the presence of multiple diseases and medications are common contributing factors. Standardized measurement of postural blood pressure and recording of heart rate and assessment of associated symptoms are essential for the clinical diagnosis. Evaluation and management depend on an initial thorough clinical review of problems. Usually elimination of offending medications and treatment of contributing medical disorders are adequate. Occasionally, use of volume expanders and newer experimental agents is indicated. Postural hypotension can be seen as a prototypical clinical disorder of the elderly. It reflects impaired homeostasis; its etiology is multifactorial and due to the effects of both age and disease; it is clinically protean; and it can result in falls, injury, and progressive decline if not recognized and treated early.",

Hypochondriacal patients misunderstand the nature and significance of these symptoms and believe that they are evidence of serious disease. Hypochondriasis can be a part of another syndrome, usually an affective one, or it can be a primary disorder. The prevalence differs between cultures and social classes. Constitutional factors, disease in the family in childhood, and previous disease predispose to hypochondriasis. Various stressors can be precipitating events. Selective perception of symptoms, motivated by fear of disease, and subsequent increase in anxiety with more somatic symptoms appear to be links in the vicious cycle of the hypochondriacal reaction. Psychotherapy as well as psychotropic drugs are effective in the treatment of functional somatic symptoms. There are no adequate controlled studies of psychotherapy in hypochondriasis, and the recommended treatments are based on studies with similar disorders. The prognosis of treated hypochondriasis is good in a substantial proportion of patients.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy by itself may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychological comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if depressive-anxious disorders are suspected, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also in disrupted compliance. Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist should have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be combined with systemic and topical treatment of acne in conjunction with basic psychosomatic treatment.",

For example, a meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of depression among fathers was 9.76% during the prenatal period and 8.75% during the postpartum year.1 Paternal perinatal depression can deteriorate the marital relationship and generate psychosocial and behavioral problems in the offspring (Ramchandani et al., 2021).2 However, paternal perinatal depression has received comparatively little clinical attention. A review of the literature on this subject will list the biological, psychological and social risk factors for this condition, which include a history of depression or anxiety disorders, lack of social support, conflicts in the couple's relationship, economic and labor problems. The clinical characteristics of depression share similarities with depressions in other periods of life, and there are differential clinical features, such as anger, aggressiveness, somatic symptoms and greater comorbidity with substance abuse disorder. Early detection with scales such as the Edinburgh, Gotland and PAPA and the appropriate approach are fundamental to mitigate the effects of paternal perinatal depression. Psychotherapeutic support, psychoeducation of the disorder, and self-care tools can be part of a comprehensive approach to help parents experiencing this condition. In conclusion, the proposal to include this disorder within the parental perinatal affective disorders, as proposed by the author Baldoni,3 given the level of overlap that it usually has with other comorbid conditions (anxiety, alcohol abuse, impulse control disorders) and high frequency of masked symptoms, goes in the direction to give the attention it deserves for early detection and provide adequate support and treatment.",

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

Endocrine responses to stressful experience vary widely among individuals, and may account for some of the individual variability in vulnerability to development of psychosomatic symptoms under stress. Endocrine stress responsiveness probably has a large genetic component, but is also known to be modifiable by prolonged and/or profound stressful experience. Social and cognitive factors influence the pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and sex differences may also be significant. It may be possible to develop specific tests of endocrine responsiveness, perhaps incorporating psychological and pharmacological challenges, that may serve as markers of chronic stress experience or of vulnerability to psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A hiccup is a sudden contraction of the inspiratory and diaphragmatic muscles followed by an abrupt closure of the glottis; that produces a characteristic noise resulting from vibrations of the vocal cords. Brief episodes of hiccups are common in humans at all stages of life and are usually benign. Prolonged attacks that last for days or weeks are considered a more serious phenomenon and may indicate an underlying disorder warranting a comprehensive medical evaluation. These attacks have been associated with significant burden and morbidity. The most common triggers for acute hiccups are linked with gastro-intestinal causes, such as the gastric distension that occurs after an abundant meal, or with gastroesophageal disease. Sudden changes in temperature, excessive alcohol consumption, as well as excitement or emotional stress, may also set off acute hiccups. Certain drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and many others, have been reported to induce hiccups. Drug-induced hiccups are diagnosed by exclusion of other causes and represent a very unusual side-effect of drugs like corticosteroids. We present a case of hiccups associated with intra-articular Diprospan (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate) administration.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent one of the leading problems of the public health community in the modern world today, especially because their incidence is steadily increasing and they are one of the main reasons for the overall disease burden in Europe. One of the most frequently diagnosed, yet under recognized diseases, is depression. Depression, whether a symptom, part of a syndrome or an independent diagnosis, is characterized by feelings of sadness, loss of interest and pleasure in activities that normally bring joy to a person, and can affect how a person feels, thinks and behaves. It affects all age and social groups, as well as both sexes, it is often comorbid with other physical diseases, and increases the risk of developing other physical diseases. There are certain differences between the sexes in the prevalence, the way a certain sex group deals with problems caused by depression, and the possible causes of these differences, which we present in more detail in this paper. Differences are observed in all cultures, environments and across different age groups. Patients suffering from depression have a particularly high risk of committing suicide. Suicide is a psychopathological phenomenon of multifactorial aetiology that is most often associated with psychiatry and mental disorders and is not a diagnosis in itself, but a complication of many psychiatric disorders. here are many differences in the rate of suicide by age and sex, as well as in the method of suicide, which we also present in more detail in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Prejudicial beliefs, emotions, and behaviours cause discrimination against people labeled as mentally ill. This stigmatization is sometimes internalized by the patients, leading to self-stigmatization. Specific features and impacts of stigmatization and self-stigmatization in patients with bipolar illness are the subjects of this review.Studies were identified through PUBMED, Web of Science and Scopus databases as well as existing reviews. The search terms included \"bipolar disorder\", \"stigma\", \"self-stigma\" psychoeducation\", \"psychotherapy\", \"psychosocial treatment\". Key articles listed in reference lists were searched.Considerable recent evidence indicates that bipolar patients and their families are stigmatized, and that this stigmatization affects their quality of life as well as social functioning. The severity of stigmatization in bipolar disorder is greater than that in people with depression. There is also evidence of self-stigmatization which further decreases the quality of life. Stigmatization and self-stigmatization were shown to be one of the barriers that delay or prevent effective treatment, and thus exert adverse effects on the outcomes of bipolar disorder.Stigma affects the experience of illness as well as social functioning in patients with bipolar disorder. The impact of stigma on the lives and treatment outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder mandates intensive effort of mental health research and policy to address this problem. Much has been done against the stigmatization of the mentally ill. But the fight against stigma remains a fundamental objective of health programs for mental health.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depressive illness in the elderly may be the result of a physical illness, the cause of secondary physical problems, coincidental tophysical illness or the result of an aetiological factor common to both conditions. Analysis of a cross‐sectional community sample of 396 elderly people showed depression to be significantly linked to presence of headaches, dyspnoea, and malignant disease known to the patient. It was not linked with heart disease nor arthritis per se , although those on anti‐arthritic or analgesic medication were significantly more depressed. The subjective description of physical health given by the patient also correlated strongly with depression. Depressive illness is sometimes unrecognized and frequently untreated with a consequent reduction in quality of life for many patients. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility that depression may coexist with physical illness, and that both conditions may need appropriate treatment. Further analysis of the above sample, controlling for physical illness and the additive effect of the variables concerned, showed depression to be positively correlated with adverse social factors such as not going out because of physical disability, feeling lonely, having a shopper and having hearing difficulties. The home help service was identified as a probable protective factor, implying the importance of this service in supporting the emotional as well as the physical needs of its clients.",

It has long been recognized that physiological arousal is a basic and important factor in health and behavior. Stress has been extensively studied with regard to the increases in arousal that it produces and the adverse effects on health that it can have. In addition, a substantial literature identifies and studies drugs that contribute to arousal. In particular, these include caffeine, which is arguably the single most common source of increments in arousal. Heightened arousal has widespread physiological and behavioral consequences. Increments in arousal are associated with elevations in anxiety, hostility, and irritability; chronically high arousal may contribute to anxiety, somatoform, and depressive disorders, among others.

The complications of occupational exposure to neurotoxins and putative neurotoxins are also covered in so far as they relate to the fitness of an exposed employee to continue working. In addition to a few well-known and common conditions, many uncommon but distinct neurological disorders may present at work or affect work capacity. Fitness for work in these disorders will be determined by the person’s functional abilities, any co-morbid illness, the efficacy or side effects of the treatment, and psychological and social factors, rather than by the precise diagnosis. This will also need to be put into the context of the job in question, as the basic requirements for a manual labouring job may be completely different from something more intellectually demanding. Indeed, even an apparently precise diagnostic label such as multiple sclerosis can encompass a complete spectrum of disability, from someone who is entirely asymptomatic to another who is totally incapacitated. Furthermore, reports by general practitioners, neurologists, or neurosurgeons may describe the symptoms, signs, and investigations in detail, but without analysing functional abilities. These colleagues may also fail to appreciate the workplace hazards, the responsibilities of the employer, or what scope exists for adaptations to the job or workplace.",

Body dysmorphic disorder is an increasingly recognized somatoform disorder, clinically distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and depression. Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with an imagined deficit in the appearance of one or more body parts, causing clinically significant stress, impairment, and dysfunction. The preoccupation is not explained by any other psychiatric disorder. Patients present to family physicians for primary care reasons and aesthetic or cosmetic procedures. Cosmetic correction of perceived physical deficits is rarely an effective treatment. Pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and non-pharmacologic treatment with cognitive behavior therapy are effective. Body dysmorphic disorder is not uncommon, but is often misdiagnosed. Recognition and treatment are important because this disorder can lead to disability, depression, and suicide. Psychiatric social work assessment and intervention was provided to the person with Body dysmorphic disorder, focusing on to building for change in misbelieve and strengthening commitment to change. The psycho social intervention was provided to the patients and his family members. Sessions on Admission counseling, Family intervention, Supportive therapy, Psycho education, role play, reminiscence, Pre discharge counseling, Discharge Counseling and Social Group Work was conducted. At the end of the therapy, the client knowledge about the illness and coping skills has improved.",

Based on clinical experience and review of the clinical and legal research literature, the author proposes that a cluster of six clinical findings is a potential indicator of internal corroboration that trauma occurred, especially child sexual abuse. These six clinical findings include: the presence of a high-risk disorder or illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; age regression, flashbacks, abreactions, or other re-experiencing of the trauma; repetitions, repetition compulsions, or reenactments; characteristics of the memories themselves; and other patterns, dynamics, and connections. This framework can serve as a useful and clinical paradigm for all illnesses, including the addictive disorders.",

Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is becoming increasingly common in modern society and leads to significant issues for people’s health and well-being. Sex differences in sleep begin at an early age and continue throughout life. At the same time, women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than men. Some studies show that men and women differ in their neurohormonal secretion, biological processes, and brain morphology. A significant number of women experience sleep difficulties in the approach to menopause and beyond, with the most common symptoms being difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality. The aetiology of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women isn’t yet still clear and seems to be different according to the specific symptoms of sleep disorder. However, potential factors include menopause itself, ageing, vasomotor symptoms, depression, anxiety, and many other diseases such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and psychosocial factors. Insomnia may occur alone or with other medical or mental health conditions. If left untreated, it may increase the risk for developing and worsening any of these conditions. Menopause is often associated with elevated risks of cardiovascular diseases. Insomnia is considered as an established risk factor for myocardial infarction, including in women. Sex differences have been detected in studies of sleep problems, with significant associations in women with regard to hypertension, the prevalence of dyslipidaemia, obesity, and diabetes. Diagnosis of insomnia is largely based on skilled history taking. Insomnia treatment is based on two strategies that may be used isolatedly or in combination: cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and pharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "by evidence of early histological damage, functional alterations, and signs and symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are prominent features of the radiation syndrome. In considering the nature of the altered physiology of the gastrointestinal tract produced by radiation, one is dealing with a very complicated system of the body. Digestion and absorption of food are complex and poorly understood. Symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract are reflected via a complex system of nervous control through the autonomic sympathetics and parasympathetics. To complicate matters further, the gut has an enteric nervous system of its own which allows for autonomous movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms may stem from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract itself, from diseases of other parts of the body via complex nerve pathways, from impulses arising in the central nervous system, or from a combination of these sources. Gastrointestinal symptoms of central origin are frequent and complex in character. Such complexity is exemplified in the phenomenon of vomiting which may be produced by the sight of blood, extreme fear, or a shocking experience. Other gastrointestinal functional disturbances of a more chronic nature may result from psychic imbalance. It is often difficult to distinguish between organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and functional disturbances which are purely psychic in origin. In addition, disturbances of central origin are said to be produced by toxins affecting the vomiting and other higher centers. Many acute infectious diseases are ushered in with gastrointestinal symptoms which are believed to be due to central toxic as well as local effects. Disease or trauma of other viscera or parts of the body may produce gastrointestinal symptoms by reflex mechanisms through the central nervous system. Very little is yet known about the part the afferent and efferent nervous elements play in the symptomatology related to radiation injury of the gastrointestinal tract.",

The consequences of advanced disease can comprise emotional states such as anxiety, distress and depressive episodes, fear of being a burden to others, loss of control, anger, loss of sense of dignity, uncertainty, and changes in close relationships and social roles. Adjustment disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and the demoralization syndrome represent common disorders and phenomena among patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, uncontrollable pain and high unrelieved physical symptom burden, depression, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, delirium, and low family support are major factors in the desire for thoughts of suicide and the desire for hastened death. Caregivers play an important and challenging role, providing emotional and social support for the patient, helping with medical needs, and meeting increasingly complex instrumental needs such as running the household and work.",

Sympathetically maintained pain is a frequent but variable component of these syndromes, as the sympathetic and somatosensory pathways are no longer functionally distinct. Pain is the cardinal feature of CRPS, but the constellation of symptoms and signs may also include sensory changes, autonomic dysfunction, trophic changes, motor impairment and psychological changes. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, with additional information regarding the presence of sympathetically maintained pain or autonomic dysfunction being provided by carefully performed and interpreted supplemental tests. Clinical experience supports early intervention with sympatholytic procedures (pharmacological or nerve block techniques), but further scientific data is required to confirm the appropriate timing and relative efficacy of different procedures. Patients with recurrent or refractory symptoms are best managed in a multi-disciplinary pain clinic as more invasive and intensive treatment will be required to minimize ongoing pain and disability.",

At any one time, around 1 in 5 adults will report symptoms of low back pain, rising to 40% when asked if they have experienced symptoms during the previous month. The majority of people who experience an episode of low back pain will improve over time. However a sizeable proportion experience repeated episodes or recurrences, and some report continuous symptoms for many years. A wide range of factors are linked to both the onset and persistence of low back pain. Some studies have related age and gender to low back pain, but the link overall is equivocal. Work-related factors such as heavy lifting, and socio-demographic factors such as smoking and obesity have been linked with the onset of low back pain. High levels of functional impairment and the presence of pain radiating to the leg have been cited as factors associated with a poor prognosis among primary care consulters with low back pain. Other characteristics associated with both the development and the persistence of low back pain include psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and workplace factors such as job satisfaction. Low back pain places large demands on health, social and welfare systems. Further research is needed to identify practical interventions to reduce this burden from low back pain.",

Speculation concerning possible relationship between cause and effect in such instances has resulted principally from clinical analysis of these disorders, particularly from the results of therapeutic attack on the autonomic nervous system in patients suffering from them.

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Naturally, chronic pain can present occasions when patients feel misunderstood or mistreated, feel threatened by poor health, experience interference with normal daily functioning, take medications that can produce side effects, and experience depression and anxiety. When chronic pain leads to painful emotions, memories, and other unwanted experiences, the pain sufferer will naturally attempt to avoid these as well. On the level of human experience, chronic pain brings loss, threats, uncertainty, restraint, apparent mistreatment, and failure into the lives of those who suffer with it. Chronic pain is possibly not best understood as a symptom or condition of the body that results in effects on the person and their functioning. The behavior of the individual pain sufferer, interacting with and in a broader psychological context, is an indivisible whole.",

In this case, alternative approaches are needed to prevent and treat depression. Our literature review shows that high levels of physical activity and exercise have protective effects on depression cases. In combination with other treatment modalities, exercise and physical activity may lead to a more rapid improvement of the clinical picture.

Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

We aimed to review the prevalence, natural course, potential predisposing factors (physiological, psychocognitive, and organic), and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of poststroke fatigue. Using PubMed CINAHL and PsycINFO, we reviewed all the available literature on poststroke fatigue and related issues. The prevalence of poststroke fatigue ranges from 23% to 75%, depending on the definition of fatigue and the characteristics of the patients included. Post-stroke fatigue seems to be of complex etiology. Predisposing factors were physiological ones including functional disability, prestroke fatigue, medical comorbidities, medication, sleep disturbances, and nutritional problems; psychocognitive ones including depression and cognitive dysfunction; and organic ones including damage to particular brain areas with consequent neurochemical alterations, perfusion deficit, and neuroinflammation. Poststroke fatigue is a persistent and debilitating symptom in some patients, and can have adverse affects on patient's neurological recovery, quality of life, and mortality. Few therapeutic trials have been reported, and the therapy was rarely successful, possibly because of the complex nature of poststroke fatigue. Poststroke fatigue is a common and frequently disabling problem of complex etiology. Further studies are urgently needed to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of post-stroke fatigue and to develop better treatments for this condition.",

Although most acute episodes of LBP are self-limiting, recurrent pain occurs in about 50–75% of individuals within 1 year. For the majority of patients, LBP is a chronic-recurrent problem and thus initial treatment recommendations should focus on long-term active approaches to health and well-being. Psychosocial and affective factors are the best predictors of an episode of acute LBP transitioning to a chronic pain state. These include depression, anxiety, trauma, social marginalization, passive coping, and fear. Exercise is generally the best supported treatment for LBP, although there are no real data to suggest that any one particular approach is uniquely beneficial. Excessive rest, unnecessary imaging, negative language, inaccurate and unhelpful diagnoses, excessive activity restrictions, and reliance on generally unhelpful or overtly harmful medications lead to iatrogenic disability and worse outcomes.",

Prevalence rates for the assorted conditions vary considerably but the most reliable estimates are greater than 50% for strokes involving the somatosensory system, brachial plexus avulsions, spinal cord injury, and limb amputation, with controversy surrounding the mechanistic contributions of deafferentation to ensuing neuropathic pain syndromes. Deafferentation pain has also been described for loss of other body parts (e.g., eyes and breasts) and may contribute to between 10% and upwards of 30% of neuropathic symptoms in peripheral neuropathies. There is no pathognomonic test or sign to identify deafferentation pain, and part of the controversy surrounding it stems from the prodigious challenges in differentiating cause and effect. For example, it is unknown whether cortical reorganization causes pain or is a byproduct of pathoanatomical changes accompanying injury, including pain. Similarly, ascertaining whether deafferentation contributes to neuropathic pain, or whether concomitant injury to nerve fibers transmitting pain and touch sensation leads to a deafferentation-like phenotype can be clinically difficult, although a detailed neurologic examination, functional imaging, and psychophysical tests may provide clues. Due in part to the concurrent morbidities, the physical, psychologic, and by extension socioeconomic costs of disorders associated with deafferentation are higher than for other chronic pain conditions. Treatment is symptom-based, with evidence supporting first-line antineuropathic medications such as gabapentinoids and antidepressants. Studies examining noninvasive neuromodulation and virtual reality have yielded mixed results.",

The aim is to refute the hypothesis of the need to identify this clinical condition in a new descriptive framework. Materials and methods: Pubmed checklist, clinical interview, and psychometric tests. Results: In the entirety of the selected population, it emerges that the primary disorder is schizoid personality disorder; this is followed by depressive disorder, narcissistic covert disorder, bipolar disorder with depressive prevalence, obsessive disorder, avoidant disorder, and somatic disorder as secondary dysfunctional personality traits. Childhood and/or family trauma, capable of impacting the sexual and affective sphere, is present in almost the entire population. Conclusion: The syndrome should be framed as a specific phenomenon and not as a new psychopathological disorder, as the symptomatological descriptions are similar to the already known schizoid personality disorder; the symptomatological differences among patients should be framed according to a logic of correctives determined by the presence of one or more secondary psychopathological traits that draw a more complex personality picture than the simple nosographic diagnosis of the DSM-V.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

      "abstract": "Primary headaches can be considered simultane- ously as symptom and disease itself, while secondary headaches are expressions of a pathological process that can be systemic or locoregional. Because of its subjective features, headache is often difficult to assess and quantify by severity, frequency and invalidity rate, and for these reasons it has often been implicated in legal controversies. Headache has seldom been considered in the criminal law, except when it represents a typical symptom of a disease whose existence can be objectively assessed (i.e. raised intracranial pressure). Therefore, in civil legislation it is not yet coded to start claiming for invalidity compensation. In particular, one of the most debated medical-legal ques- tions is represented by headaches occurring after head injury. Headache is often the principal symptom at the beginning of several toxic chronic syndromes, with many implications, especially in working claims, and, more recently, it may be referred to as one of the most frequent symptoms by victims of mobbing (i.e. psychological harassment in the workplace). The National Institute for Industrial Accident Insurance (INAIL) scales (instituted by the law 38/2000) mention the Subjective cranial trauma syndrome and give an invalidity rate evaluation. With ref- erence to other headache forms, no legislation really exists at the present time, and headache is only considered as a symptom of a certain coded disease. Requests for invalid- ity social pension and the question of off-label prescrip- tions (drug prescription for a disease, without formal indi- cation for it) are other controversial matters.",

      "title": "Clinical and Pathophysiological Aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychological symptoms, then a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS] should be considered, according to the Centers for Disease Control case definition [1994]. Actually, the diagnosis of CFS is only a clinical diagnosis, since laboratory tests are only useful to identify and/or exclude alternative diseases with a well defined etiology, which may explain the same symptoms. The CFS onset is explained by different etiopathogenetic hypotheses: toxic exposure well documented in some cases [e.g., ciguatera poisoning, workers exposure to solvents and other chemicals], infectious agents [e.g., Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses, coxsackievirus, etc.], immunologic factors [CFS = Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome-CFIDS], neuroendocrine alterations [significant dysfunction of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis has been observed in CFS patients]. Also the psychiatric hypothesis is still credited by CFS researchers. However, a concurrent diagnosis of major depression should exclude a diagnosis of CFS according to the last case definition. Furthermore the depressive syndrome often observed in CFS patients is often secondary to the malaise and disability. Although the various pathogenetic hypotheses are not necessarily in contrast, it seems more likely that CFS is a heterogeneous disease, probably multifactorial, or that CFS includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. Among the several questions which are still unexplained there is one of remarkable importance about the pathogenetic substrate of CFS symptoms and particularly of “fatigue.” Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the fatigue or the other neuromuscular symptoms [e.g., myalgia] have a central or a peripheral origin. Most of the alterations described so far in CFS point out a clinical and a functional impairment of the central nervous system. However, our own observations at the Reference Center for CFS Study of Chieti University indicate the existence of peripheral alterations [neuromuscular] and this supports the theory about a heterogeneity of the CFSs.",

      "title": "The assessment of pain in cattle: a review.",
      "abstract": "Abstract The assessment of pain in cattle is hindered by the difficulty of communication between species and the possibility that prey species, such as cattle, limit behaviour indicative of pain due to the danger of predation. To identify behavioural and physiological responses caused by the pain of any surgical procedure, injury or disease, it is necessary to compare the responses of animals that have received or not received effective local anaesthesia or analgesia. Few such studies have been carried out. The responses of animals to any injury may be due to irritation, dysfunction or be part of the convalescence process and may not be caused by pain per se . Specific behaviours may indicate pain following specific injuries. The pain caused by different injuries may evoke specific behaviours so many sets of observations are required to define the behaviours evoked by pain. Head and tail shaking and the lack of grooming and rumination are useful indicators of pain after dehorning but there is a need to quantify whether these behaviours are useful indicators of pain following other injuries by further behavioural observational studies. Generally, behaviour is most useful in a clinical situation. However, physiological responses to different procedures, such as the plasma cortisol response, can be used to compare the relative painfulness of different experiences under experimental conditions and the results of this type of research can then be used clinically. Changes in productivity and immunocompetence during and following a painful experience are probably not useful tools to measure pain. Behaviour and physiological responses are useful ways to assess acute pain but there are problems with the assessment of chronic pain. The response of cattle to specific stimuli (mechanical, pressure and thermal) may be useful to measure chronic pain. Much work is required to confirm that specific behaviours or the absence of them are useful general indicators of pain in cattle and to identify those behaviours which may be useful indicators of pain after specific injuries.",

Most of the patients who use the services of the Kainuu Central hospital pain clinic suffer from low back pain. IASP (International Association of the study of Pain) defines pain as unpleasant sensory or emotional experience with possible or clear tissue damage, or which is described at the same way. Acute and chronic pain differ from each other clearly. Acute pain warns about danger that is threatening the human body. This starts us to evaluate the situation and to act upon the danger. Behind an acute pain is always some somatic disturbance or disease. Acute pain causes also many changes in the autonomic nervous system; blood pressure, muscle tension and heart rate raise when the body is in the alarm position. Chronic pain doesn't warn the body about threatening danger because clear pathology doesn't always exist. Chronic pain reduces human life. It causes zest for life, tiring and reluctance. The chronic pain brings also following symptoms: sleeping disturbances, depression, social isolation, unemployment and loss of control of life.",

It is important to distinguish these from the symptoms of an ongoing or latent medical or psychiatric condition that are magnified in the premenstrual period. A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness. The complex downstream effects of cycling estrogen and progesterone are believed to account for the multitude of possible manifestations of these disorders as well as for the exacerbation of certain medical and psychiatric conditions in relation to the menstrual cycle.",

      "abstract": "Mental disorders are characterized by disturbances of thought, perception, affect and behavior, which occur as a result of brain damage. Recognizing and treating these conditions is necessary not only for psychiatrists but for all physicians. Disorder of mental function is one of the most common associated conditions in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, disturbances of mental function often remain unrecognized. In ICU patients, different types of mental function disorders may develop. They range from sleep disorders, severe depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to cognitive disorders including delirium. The causes of mental dysfunction in ICU patients can be divided into environmental and medical. Cognitive disorders are related to mental processes such as learning ability, memory, perception and problem solving. Cognitive disorders are usually not prominent in the early postoperative period and in many cases are discovered after hospital discharge because of difficulties in performing everyday activities at home or at work. The etiology of postoperative cognitive impairment is unclear. Older age, previous presence of cognitive dysfunction, severity of disease, and polypharmacy with more than four drugs are some of the risk factors identified. Delirium is a multifactorial disorder. It is an acute confusional state characterized by alteration of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention. It is considered as the most common form of mental distress in ICU patients. Nearly 30% of all hospitalized patients pass through deliriant phase during their hospital stay. Delirium can last for several days to several weeks. Almost always it ends with complete withdrawal of psychopathological symptoms. Sometimes it can evolve into a chronic brain syndrome (dementia). The causes are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease the symptoms. Delirious patient is at risk of complications of immobility and confusion, leading to a high prevalence of irreversible functional decline. An interdisciplinary approach to delirium should also include family or other caregivers. In the diagnosis of delirium, several tests are used to complement clinical assessment. Among the most commonly used are the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test. Depression is a common disorder among patients treated at ICU and occurs due to the impact of the disease on the body and the quality of life, independence, employment and other aspects of life. Depression can interfere with the speed of recovery, affects the postoperative quality of life, and in a certain number of patients may lead to suicidal thoughts and intentions. Phobias and generalized anxiety are the most common anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by strong, excessive anxiety and worry about everyday life events. PTSD is delayed and/or protracted response to a stressful event or situation, extremely threatening or catastrophic nature, which is outside the common experience of people and would hit or traumatize almost all people. Treatment of delirium and other disorders is causal. The causes of psychosis are often multifactorial and require a number of measures to ease symptoms. The primary objective of prevention is appropriate therapy and correction of potential imbalances possibly underlying disturbances, stabilization of vital functions as well as early return to daily activities. Doctors and other medical staff must be aware of the importance and consequences of behavioral and emotional disorders in critically ill patients. Additional research is needed to discover the ways to prevent and/ or reduce the frequency and severity of the consequences and treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are particularly common presentations in primary care settings. They lie on a severity spectrum, with significant overlaps with other functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses like depression and anxiety, and general medical conditions. Typically, symptoms present with either no identifiable medical aetiology, or are disproportionate to the cause, with associated distress and preoccupations, health-related anxiety, and help-seeking behaviours. Cultural factors are known to shape shared mental representations about interpreting such symptom experiences and are therefore vital determinants of health and illness reporting. The nosology of MUS has been debated, deliberated, and transformed several times over the last century. Several models have been proposed to understand the pathogenesis of MUS based on the complex interaction of developmental, personality, cognitive–perceptual, cultural, and emotional processes within a bio-psycho-socio-cultural framework. Effective and sensitive communication of socio-culturally grounded and individualized illness formulations that link the individual’s belief systems, diagnosis, and treatment options are key to managing MUS. Medications are used to treat severe symptoms or comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. Psychotherapy that targets coping, help-seeking behaviours, and real-world functioning is also effective.",

This condition could be the suppression of projection and externalization of negative mental contents under a given stress. The author would like to call this form of stress `dissociogenic stress.' Whether or not an individual develops a dissociative disorder as a result of dissociogenic stress also depends on the individual's constitutionally based dissociative and hypnotic tendency.",

Depressive conditions are major clinical problems that occur throughout life and often require a specialized treatment, but the use of the antidepressant compounds is often endangered by the risk of formidable side effects, requiring to stop the treatment or to use medicine doses that cannot determine the desired therapeutic results. These are reasons for the impressive expansion of the research on the depression types, with emphasize on etiological and etiopathogenetical studies, allowing the discovery of compounds with good therapeutic potential and an appropriate pharmacological profile to reduce the side effects. Diabetes (diabetes mellitus) is a major public health problem, with increasing costs and frequency in recent years. Late diagnosis, inadequate treatment, lack of ongoing monitoring or ignorance of the disease can have serious consequences for the health of that individual, his family and his community. The mental state of a patient with diabetes is different from one moment to the next and varies with the stage of the disease and the appearance of various complications. The stress of chronic illness, the pressure to have a lifestyle and a diet according to medical recommendations, sadness, anger and even denial of the disease, are feelings experienced by patients with diabetes at least once in their lives.",

Mobbing, defined as repeated psychological harassment in the workplace, is a prolonged process rather than a single incident. Those subjected to mobbing often exhibit various physical and psychological symptoms. Numerous studies in the literature indicate that mobbing can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma, characterized by its sudden onset and life-threatening impact, significantly harms individuals. This review focuses on the psychological issues arising from PTSD due to mobbing, highlighting conditions such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders, and PTSD itself. The loss of self-confidence and self-esteem observed in mobbing victims can exacerbate these issues, potentially leading to suicidal tendencies. Research findings indicate alarmingly high rates of these outcomes, underscoring the severe impact of mobbing on mental health.",

The compartment syndrome is mainly associated with contact or endurance sports and its classification is according to the time of appearance, in acute and chronic by overexertion or according to the body site. In order to detect it in an acute presentation, its signs and symptoms can be classically defined in the 5 P's; however, the chronic compartment syndrome could appear with other associated findings, depending on the committed site, making it easily confused with other processes. This entity should be suspected in every sportsman or woman when pain appears that is exaggerated in the affected extremity or body compartment, compared to the mechanism of the injury and when there are signs in the affected extremity to complete the 5 P's, associated or not to the causes that originate it, and the associated risk factors. If the compartment syndrome is suspected, the intra-compartment pressures of an invasive type must be checked by the attending medical professional and, in order to rule it out from other entities, it is useful to send serum para-clinical tests to check for associated muscle necrosis, together with the taking of imaging tests, if technological care allows it. Always when faced with a compartment syndrome, the associated complications must be considered. Early fasciotomy is the treatment of choice and it is up to the specialist to practice it in the acute compartment syndrome. In relation to the chronic compartment syndrome the activity that is being carried out must be suspended, to treat the patient with other measures that could diminish the process, including powerful analgesia, handling of footwear or of surface to avoid to increase it, analgesics under scales of pain of medical type and until drugs like the botulinum toxin A by expert personnel, but always the handling must be expectant and to watch it by a specialist because it could need surgical handling of definitive form. Specialized evaluation and appropriate decision making by sports training staff in a timely manner can avoid temporary or permanent complications in the affected individual. We hope that this review can raise awareness among all sports practitioners, their counselors, and medical and non-medical personnel for better detection of this complication of sports injuries.",

Despite the fact that infertility is not a life-threatening condition, it is still a stressful life event for couples or people owing to the high value placed on having a child by individuals or society in general. Infertile couples are dealing with a variety of emotional issues in addition to a medical ailment. Infertile couples’ emotions, feelings, and beliefs frequently alter as a result of their infertility diagnosis. Due to the extreme seclusion of the subject, infertile couples may resort to hiding the problem if they are under a lot of societal pressure. The inability to conceive has been regarded as a stressful situation for both the person and the couple. The news of infertility elicits the same emotional responses as a death or catastrophic sickness. The medical treatment of infertility causes anxiety and pain, and this suffering and anxiety can have an impact on the treatment’s outcomes. Failed attempts result in major narcissistic injuries, which are frequently compounded by sexuality issues and relationship difficulties.",

Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by relapsing and remitting symptoms. Treatment strategies should focus on alleviating the most bothersome symptom and can be based on the proposed underlying pathophysiology. The effect of gender on mechanisms of disease, symptom presentation, and treatment response is an area of increasing interest and study. As with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, there appear to be some gender-specific features of functional dyspepsia. Specifically, gender-related differences have been observed in some studies of both the prevalence of individual dyspepsia symptoms, and in gastric emptying and proximal gastric motor function. There also appear to be gender differences in the psychosocial realm, with dyspeptic women experiencing a lesser sense of well-being than dyspeptic men, as well as an association of an abuse history with functional dyspepsia. This review will highlight specific gender differences related to the symptom presentation, pathophysiology, and approach to treatment of functional dyspepsia, while noting where differences have not been found and where further investigation is warranted.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "title": "Similarities between explaining dizziness and explaining pain? Exploring common patient experiences, theoretical models, treatment approaches and potential therapeutic narratives for persistent dizziness or pain",
      "abstract": "Pain and dizziness are common experiences throughout the lifespan. However, nearly a quarter of those with acute pain or dizziness experience persistence, which is associated with disability, social isolation, psychological distress, decreased independence, and poorer quality of life. Thus, persistent pain or dizziness impacts peoples’ lives in similarly negative ways. Conceptual models of pain and dizziness also have many similarities. Many of these models are more expansive than explaining mere symptoms; rather they describe pain or dizziness as holistic experiences that are influenced by biopsychosocial and contextual factors. These experiences also appear to be associated with multi-modal bodily responses related to evaluation of safety, threat detection and anticipation, as influenced by expectations, and predictions anticipation, not simply a reflection of tissue injury or pathology. Conceptual models also characterize the body as adaptable and therefore capable of recovery. These concepts may provide useful therapeutic narratives to facilitate understanding, dethreaten the experience, and provide hope for patients. In addition, therapeutic alliance, promoting an active movement-based approach, building self-efficacy, and condition-specific approaches can help optimize outcomes. In conclusion, there are significant overlaps in the patient experience, theoretical models and potential therapeutic narratives that guide care for people suffering with persistent pain or dizziness.",

      "abstract": "Wajaul Mafasil (Rheumatoid arthritis) has become one of the most pressing global public health problems. In India alone an estimated 1% population is suffering from W M. Wajaul Mafasil which is a future threat to the physical, psychological, social and economic well being of the human beings. It often deprives people of their freedom and independence and can disrupt the lives of family members and other care givers. Physical symptoms of arthritis, pain, loss of joint movement and fatigue puts individuals at higher risk for a variety of other diseases, including premature death, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, colon cancer, overweight, depression and anxiety. In fact, in its severe forms WM can shorten life expectancy. Psychological stress depression, anger and anxiety often accompany WM. People with WM may experience difficulty in coping with pain and disability which in turn can lead to a feeling of helplessness, lack of self-control and changes in self esteem and self image. Social well-being is also affected by decreased community involvement, difficulties in their work place and in sexual activities. These social problems are often aggravated by lack of understanding and empathy among family members, co-workers, employers, etc. Based on the references available in the Unani Classics the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine formulated some simple new combination of drugs and subjected them to multicentric trials at Council's institutes. Prior to multicentric trial, preliminary screening was performed at the Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Chennai in the year 1979 in which significant effects and clinical safety was observed. Later, the formulations were modified and multicentric study was undertaken along with some other combinations at Councils centres at Lucknow, Bhadrak, Mumbai, New Delhi, Srinagar and Bangalore. Multidimensional studies covering clinical, pathological, biochemical, physiological, herido-familial aspects in WM patients were studied besides Munzij and Mushil therapy and Hajamat (cupping). Since 1979, 40,000 patients were registered and treated at different centres of the Council. Out of these 8,000 patients fulfilling the research criteria were registered for study. Seven thousand five hundred and twenty-nine patients completed the study in different treatment groups. The cases were diagnosed on the basis of the sign and symptoms as per Unani classification taking in to consideration the involvement different humors, and the stage of the disease etc and correlated with the modern parameters 1987 revised ARA/ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. The cases were classified as per standard criteria of possible, probable, definite and classical stages.",

Objectively verifiable pathology may explain a patient's symptoms, but complaints themselves are never objective but rather, by definition, subjective. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment ( AMA Guides ), Sixth Edition, defines the terminology: Subjective information is more open to interpretation, but objective data are factual, reproducible, and often measurable or quantifiable. Objective findings generally have much higher inter-examiner reliability than subjective findings. Symptoms and most findings on physical (particularly neuromusculoskeletal) examination are subjective. Diagnostic study results and a minority of physical findings are objective. Some physical findings, such as strength and range of motion measurements, are both subjective and objective. Repeat testing, assessment of plausibility, and use of confirmatory physical findings can be used to validate or “objectify” subjective findings (eg, by determining if a weakness is corroborated by other neurologic or physical findings, imaging study results, and/or electrodiagnostic testing). The use of objective, or at least less subjective, findings in impairment rating should improve interrater reliability. Thus, evaluating physicians should not regard subjective complaints and findings, and they should lend greater weight to objective findings.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

When this responsibility is questioned as a result of some change in mental state, a clear cut and absolute statement of presence or absence of mental capacity seems to be expected. This is not necessarily a helpful approach or consistent with clinical observations. Where the individual is impaired due to alcohol, narcotics, barbituates and other drugs this limitation of mental capacity is rarely total. The situation is similar in states of fatigue, hunger or chronic illness, or even of emotional disturbance. The problem of impairment, even when only partial, is that a pattern of behaviour may emerge, due to disturbances in perception, judgment, and coordination which are grossly deviant from that of the individual in a sober state and do not represent his desire or intent in that state. The extent to which this person is addicted and the extent to which permanent brain damage exists also influence the degree of manifest disturbance when alcohol or drugs are used. These have pertinence in considering the culpability of persons accused of murder and other serious crimes, especially in attempting to determine appropriate sentence or disposal.",

Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

      "abstract": "Despite multiple and often overlapping definitions of disability and frailty, both are common clinical characteristics of aged individuals though not identical. The geriatric syndrome of frailty is described as status of global impairment of physiological reserves involving multiple organ systems. The clinical correlate of frailty manifests as increased vulnerability, impaired capability to withstand intrinsic and environmental stressors, and limited capacity to maintain physiological and psychosocial homeostasis. Geriatric frailty is found in 20–30% of the elderly population over 75 years and increases with advancing age. It was reported to be associated with long-term adverse health-related outcomes – increased risk of geriatric syndromes, dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional placement, and mortality. The clinical phenotype of frailty manifests as multi-system pathologies characterized by low physical activity, global weakness with low muscle strength, fatigability/exhaustion, overall slowness particularly of gait, loss of weight among others. These above-mentioned clinical symptoms could be explained by (or related to) some ‘preclinical’ diagnoses such as sarcopenia, osteopenia, nonspecific balance disorders, nutritional problems, and overall deconditioning. More recent studies found the frailty clinical phenotype to be associated with pathologic laboratory markers (IL-6, CRP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, IGF-1, D-dimers), which suggest possible pathogenesis involving hormonal dysregulation, immuno-aging, pro-coagulation and pro-inflammatory status. In the article, current recommendations for future research strategies of frailty syndrome will be discussed.",

Compulsivity is part of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but may occasionally occur as stand-alone symptom following brain damage induced by cardiac arrest. In this case report, we describe a patient who developed compulsivity following cardiac arrest. We review diagnostic options, underlying mechanisms and possible treatments. A 65-year-old man presented at our clinic with continuous compulsive whistling following cardiac arrest. Neither obsessive-compulsive symptoms, nor other psychiatric complaints were present prior to the hypoxic incident. An EEG showed diffuse hypofunction, mainly in baso-temporal areas. Treatment with clomipramine resulted in a decrease of whistling. This case report illustrates de novo manifestation of compulsivity following cardiac arrest and subsequent brain damage and gives additional information on diagnostic options, mechanisms and treatment options. Differential diagnosis between stereotypies, punding, or OCD is difficult. Compulsivity following brain damage may benefit from treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. This finding enhances our knowledge of treatments in similar cases.",

Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

Este padecimiento no siempre es visto como una enfermedad por lo que los individuos que lo padecen no reciben siempre el tratamiento adecuado, de ahi la importancia para divulgar informacion en comunidades dedicadas a la atencion de la salud. EnglishSexual addiction (SA) formally called compulsive sexual behavior or hypersexuality disorder, is a condition in which exacerbated and inappropriate sexual behaviors and cognitions occur that generate discomfort and impairment in the function of one or more domains of life; with failure to control such behavior. SA results in psychosocial, financial and family deterioration, in addition to medical impairment such as injuries to sexual organs and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Neuroscientific evidence describes similarities between sex addicts and substance addicts. Demonstrating anatomical-functional and neuropsychological deterioration in the brain pathways involved in the processes of reward, motivation, affect, inhibition and cognition.

      "abstract": "THE condition known as 6tat marbr6 was first described fully by C. Vogt 24 in 1911 under the name of status marmoratus and has since been the subject of considerable interest and study.Nevertheless no full description has as yet appeared in any English journal, and therefore a brief introductory summary of the main clinical and pathological features may not come amiss.On the clinical side, the condition usually manifests itself from earliest infancy, development is retarded and more or less severe mental defect is of constant appearance.The picture is one of double choreoathetosis, some- times combined with epilepsy.Loss of emotional control is a pro- minent feature, and inability to use the muscles of expression and articulation sometimes occurs.In the majority of cases the condition remains stationary; in others severe generalized paralysis, often with torsion spasm and other contractures, eventually supervenes, and death occurs before or during early adult life.Pathologically the most striking feature is the peculiar marble- like appearance of certain areas of the striate body and to a lesser degree of other parts of the brain.The clinical picture, sometimes known as Vogt's disease, is considered by some to be sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosed during life, but, as we shall point out later, there are reasons for believing that the condition is not a clear-cut clinical or pathological entity.Although uncommon, the condition is probably not so rare as might at first appear.It is probable that the majority of cases have failed to come under the care of competent neurologists; some may have been attributed to meningitis or encephalitis lethargica, while others have almost certainly been overlooked in institutions or elsewhere amongst a mass of heterogeneous cerebral palsies of childhood.PERSONAL CASES Case I.-D.L., a girl, age two and a half years, was admitted to the Fountain Hospital for mental defectives on August 13, 1920.History.-Unfortunately the history of this case is very scanty, as there was no opportunity of interviewing the relatives personally and, since the patient's death, they have persistently ignored all letters.Except for some evidence of tuberculosis and paralysis on the paternal side, there is no family history of note.The patient was",

      "title": "Postconcussion Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

      "title": "Evaluation of nausea and vomiting.",
      "abstract": "A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a condition of continuous low mood and loss of energy that affects a person’s thoughts, behaviour, feelings, and physical condition. It is a disease with a thousand faces and is one of the most common disorders nowadays. Although until recently depression was considered a disorder that affects adults and the elderly, research has shown that this disorder is increasingly occurring in children, adolescents, and younger people. Adolescence is a turbulent period in which psychosocial maturity is achieved, identity is formed, crises of earlier developmental stages are resolved. If crises are not adequately resolved, the action of hereditary or various psychological, emotional and social factors leads to the development of depression. Symptoms that manifest in a depressed adolescent can be of varying intensity, may be short-lived, and may be present throughout life. Depression most commonly occurs as a primary disorder, but it can also occur in combination with other psychological disorders. In adolescents, it carries a high risk of developing delinquent behaviour, substance abuse and alcohol abuse, school failure, and suicide attempt. Diagnosing depression in children and adolescents can be challenging due to the specificity of the clinical picture in relation to adults. Therefore, a team of experts participates in the diagnosis of depressive disorders, and an important role in the team is played by a subspecialist in child and adolescent psychiatry. The treatment of depression in children and adolescents aims to eliminate symptoms and achieve complete remission, prevent recurrence, alleviate long-term morbidity and create conditions for normal growth and development. The treatment requires a holistic and multimodal approach, which includes psychoeducation, psychotherapy and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. With proper diagnosis, choice of treatment methods and the inevitable support of family and friends, depression can be cured. Since depression is a multifactorial disease, which leaves numerous consequences on the further physical and mental health of adolescents, the emphasis is on prevention. Risk and protection factors can be found in the school, family and social environment, which then means that prevention should also be multifactorial.",

Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression and schizophrenia are associated with impairment of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients. Most antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs have adverse sexual effects but it is difficult accurately to identify the incidence of treatment-emergent dysfunction, as disturbances can be reliably detected only from systematic enquiries made at baseline and during treatment. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs has led to attempts to use adjuvants or substitute treatments to resolve sexual dysfunction. More studies of the effects of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs on sexual function are needed.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

Psychiatric comorbidities, especially major depressive episodes, are highly prevailing during the course of systemic lupus erythematosus. Among them, suicide is a behavior that is much more common then we believe. &lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;: to perform a narrative review on suicidal behavior associated with systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE). &lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: studies have shown an increased risk of suicide among patients with chronic diseases and psychiatric disorder, especially depression. However, suicide occurrence cannot be attributed only to a higher prevalence of depression and other mental illnesses. It is necessary to learn more about the suicide risk factors that can be present in patients with lupus to work on a secondary prevention, and avoid not only the premature loss of lives but also the additional suffering of families and surrounding communities. The coordination between the studies on suicidal behavior and its complex network of individual and sociocultural factors and the studies on this multisystem autoimmune disease with a wide manifestation spectrum, which is lupus, creates a new and important field of research. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: non-psychiatrist office-based physicians, health clinics, or wards dedicated to the treatment of SLE should be able to recognize and handle the suicide risk factors on their patients in order to reduce the suffering caused by this disease.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "title": "Clinical and research implications of the diagnosis of dysphoric or mixed mania or hypomania",
      "abstract": "The authors reviewed available evidence regarding the status of dysphoric or mixed mania as a distinct clinical state and formulated operational criteria for its diagnosis.Studies of dysphoric mania or hypomania in patients with bipolar disorder were analyzed with regard to clinical characteristics, prevalence, demographic features, course of illness, outcome, family history, associated conditions, biological tests, and response to biological treatment.Although some studies suggest that dysphoric and nondysphoric mania are similar conditions, others suggest that, compared with nondysphoric mania, dysphoric mania may be more severe; more likely to occur in women; more likely to be associated with suicidality, a younger age at onset, a longer duration of illness, higher rates of personal and familial depression, concomitant alcohol or sedative-hypnotic abuse, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and poorer outcome; more frequently associated with cortisol nonsuppression; and less likely to respond adequately to lithium but perhaps more likely to respond to ECT or anticonvulsants.Substantial evidence suggests that dysphoric mania may be a distinct affective state. Contrary evidence, however, suggests that dysphoric mania may be a form of typical mania, a stage-related or severe form of mania, or a transitional state between mania and depression. Because the evidence may be inconsistent because of varying definitions of dysphoric mania among studies, the authors propose preliminary operational diagnostic criteria for the future study of dysphoric mania.",

      "title": "‘Depression by any other name...’",
      "abstract": "Summary There is a popular conviction that psychological disturbance is invariably a reaction to environmental events. This approach is associated with total rejection of the so-called ‘medical model’. However, allowance must be made for the fact that contemporary knowledge of psychiatric illness is well behind what is now known about general medicine, and current ideas about psychiatric aetiology may be emotionally determined to give satisfying concepts which are often almost impossible to refute. By tracing the progress of some hypotheses in general medicine, as they developed in the past, there are similarities with some current observations about the methods of action of physical treatments in psychiatry, treatments which have been discovered empirically. There is a widespread assumption that psychological responses relate precisely to the degree of evoking stress or the patient's personal attitudes to the stress. However, emotional responsiveness may show an intrinsic individual variation so that many patients who over-respond to stress may do so because of enhanced responsiveness rather than necessarily because psychological events have brought about a state of vulnerability. The exclusively dynamic approach to psychiatry has been perhaps unnecessarily encouraged by naming an illness ‘endogenous depression’ which could well be a primarily physical metabolic disturbance in the central nervous system but which happens to present with prominent depression, as well as other abnormalities. The emphasis on the component of depressed mood artificially delineates the illness and tends to impede consideration of its wider implications.",

      "title": "Current Concepts in Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Neurological Disorders",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorders (FND) are common sources of disability in medicine. Patients have often been misdiagnosed, correctly diagnosed after lengthy delays, and/or subjected to poorly delivered diagnoses that prevent diagnostic understanding and lead to inappropriate treatments, iatrogenic harm, unnecessary and costly evaluations, and poor outcomes. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder/Conversion Disorder was adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replacing the term psychogenic with functional and removing the criterion of psychological stress as a prerequisite for FND. A diagnosis can now be made in an inclusionary manner by identifying neurological signs that are specific to FNDs without reliance on presence or absence of psychological stressors or suggestive historical clues. The new model highlights a wider range of past sensitizing events, such as physical trauma, medical illness, or physiological/psychophysiological events. In this model, strong ideas and expectations about these events correlate with abnormal predictions of sensory data and body-focused attention. Neurobiological abnormalities include hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and relative disconnection with areas that select or inhibit movements and are associated with a sense of agency. Promising evidence has accumulated for the benefit of specific physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination, but clinical trial evidence remains limited. Functional neurological disorders are a neglected but potentially reversible source of disability. Further research is needed to determine the dose and duration of various interventions, the value of combination treatments and multidisciplinary therapy, and the therapeutic modality best suited for each patient.",

      "abstract": "Stress is a state of an individual that results from the interaction of the individual with the environment that is perceived as threatening to the well-being. It is an external constraint which upsets an individual both mentally and physically. Individual in a stressful situation is influenced by his or her mental ability to carry out ongoing tasks. Medical education is highly challenging and often places heavy demands on the mental health of the students. Compared to other fields of education; medical education is evidenced by high prevalence of stress. Educational process exerts an inadvertent negative effect on student’s mental health with a high frequency of depression, anxiety and stress among medical students. Students exposed to work overload and examinations in a competitive environment with constant pressure of assessment brings various changes in their daily habits such as lack of sleep and irregular diet. Mental morbidity is least accounted form of all population health studies and with the threatening rates of mental ill-health and rising rates of deaths due to the lack of early recognition of these morbidities, with not many Indian studies to document this burden. Therefore, the presence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students was assessed using a previously validated and standardized instrument, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and the associations with their socio-demographic characteristics were identified. The objectives of the study were to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among medical undergraduate students and to study the association of stress, anxiety and depression with the socio-demographic characteristics of medical under- graduate students.",

The diagnosis is established after other causes of anisocoria have been excluded. The purpose of this case report is to describe a case of benign episodic mydriasis of her right pupil in a 23-year-old female patient. The episodes lasted for 5-10 minutes and occurred spontaneously, without any concomitant symptoms or precipitating factors. The frequency of the episodes was variable, but she reported that it worsened in periods when she felt more mentally stressed or anxious. Contact with any kind of medications, homoeopathic drugs, industrial agents, or any other kind of chemical compounds was excluded, and the remaining neurological and systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood tests were taken and imaging was performed, which ruled out a structural lesion. A diagnosis of isolated benign episodic mydriasis was established. Unlike the typical presentation of the condition, the episodes did not occur in association with any form of migraine or headache. Given the benign nature of the condition, no treatment was instituted. After excluding potentially severe causes, and reassuring the patient, the frequency of the episodes decreased.",

The handling of the remains of the dead following natural disasters, disasters of human origin, terrorism and other forms of traumatic death is known to cause distress. The stress of anticipation has important psychological and physiological effects. Profound sensory stimulation is often an extremely bothersome aspect of handling the dead. Identification or emotional involvement with the deceased may produce a high degree of distress. Close supervision is important for monitoring the welfare of the worker as well as the accomplishment of the many tasks associated with recovery and identification of the dead following a disaster.

      "abstract": "Approximately 50% of people treated for depression receive treatment in primary care settings. However, studies have demonstrated that specific factors interfere with recognition of this disorder in the primary care setting and decrease the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis. Variables that relate to the patient include lack of awareness and understanding of the nature of the disease and its symptoms so that they can be accurately reported to the physician. Variability in clinical presentation and the presence of comorbid medical disorders also make detection difficult. Complaints of physical symptoms confuse the clinical picture. In addition, patients are ashamed to admit to psychological symptoms of depression and fear the stigma attached to it. Interfering factors that relate to the physician include a lack of knowledge about the disease and lack of training in its management that reduce the physician's ability to render a diagnosis and undermine confidence in the capacity to treat the illness successfully. Reluctance on the part of the physician to inquire frankly about depression also plays a role. Barriers that stem from the system include financing of care under capitated systems, other reimbursement issues, time available to care for patients, and continuity of the physician/patient relationship. A variety of tools are available to assist primary care physicians in the recognition and accurate diagnosis of depression. Use of these tools would increase the recognition and effective management of depression.",

      "title": "Treating Insomnia Disorder in the Context of Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a commoncondition. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the population experiences some symptom of insomnia, and approximately 5% to 15% of these individuals are likely tomeet criteria for an insomniadisorder.1 Traditionally, insomnia was considered as either a primary disorder or secondary to another medical or psychiatric condition. During the past 2 decades, multiple lines of evidence have converged to support the proposition that insomnia, regardless of concurrent medical and/or psychiatric illness, is an independent disorder and should be treated accordingly.2 Partially in response, insomnia is now formally classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) as a separate disorder, and thediagnosisof insomnia secondary toanother condition was removed. Numerous studies have shown that targeted treatment for insomnia iseffective in thecontextofother conditions. The success of cognitivebehavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)with secondaryor comorbid insomnia strongly suggests that, although insomniamaybe precipitated by psychiatric and/or medical illness, it is likely perpetuated by the same factors that are responsible for primary (chronic) insomnia.2 The application of CBT-I in patients with comorbid insomnia also had one significant and unexpected outcome: treatment gains were evident for the so-called parent disorder. For example, CBT-I in patients with depression led to 29% lower depression ratings vs medication alone.3 Given that numerous studies have found that CBT-I produces significant treatment outcomes in insomnia comorbid with such disorders as depression, chronic pain, and cancer (andoftenwithoutcomes that equal or exceed thenormswith uncomplicated insomnia), the time seems ripe to take stock of such findings within the framework of a proper metaanalysis. The investigation in this issueof JAMAInternalMedicine byWu and colleagues4 does precisely this. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia generally includes several components, such as sleep restriction therapy (aligningsleepopportunitywithsleepability tomaximizesleep efficiency), stimulus control therapy (maximizing the stimulus value of the bed andbedroom for sleep), sleephygiene (alleviatingobviousbarriers to sleep), cognitive therapy (addressingnighttime ruminations,worries, and fears), andsometimes relaxation interventions (reducingphysiologic arousal).5 Prior meta-analyses6 have shown that CBT-I is an efficacious treatment for reducing sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and earlymorning awakenings, aswell as increasing sleep efficiency. Furthermore, comparative meta-analyses7 have shown that CBT-I performs at least as well as pharmacotherapy or even slightly better in the short term, with superior results in the long term. Based on these and other findings, CBT-I has been adopted as a recommended first-line treatment for insomnia by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ThestudybyWuandcolleagues4examinedavailable clinical trials that evaluated CBT-I for insomnia in the context of other conditions. Studies were found that examined insomnia treatment in the context of substance abuse, renal disease, chronicpain, cancer,depression,posttraumatic stressdisorder,andotherconditions.Overall, this studyfoundthatCBT-I was associatedwith an increased likelihoodof remission from insomnia (odds ratio, 3.28; 95%CI, 2.30-4.68;P < .001). In addition, positive findingswere seen for improvements in sleep efficiencyandoverall sleepquality. Positive findingswere also seen for thecomorbidcondition ingeneral, such thatCBT-I improved noninsomnia outcomes as well. There was a significant interaction: effects on psychiatric comorbid conditions weremore robust thanwere effects for nonpsychiatric comorbidities. Themeta-analysis showed thatnotonlywasCBT-I effective in the faceof comorbid conditions, but theeffectswere relatively large (although slightly smaller thanmight be seen in primary insomnia). The studyhada few limitations that suggest directions for future research. First, the meta-analysis focused on remission and did not summarize outcomes with respect to treatment response. Second, the study couldhaveplacedmore focus on the benefits of CBT-I for the comorbid condition. As noted above, there are several studies in the literature showing that treatment of comorbid insomnia not only improves the insomnia but also improves severity and/or tolerance of symptoms of the comorbid condition (eg, produces treatRelated article page 1461 Research Original Investigation Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Comorbid Insomnia",

Trauma on a woman's thoughts, feelings, dreams, fantasies, intentions, and relations changing her attitude to life as such, to her nearest, also to the values and eventually to herself. The consequences occurring as uncontrolled chain reaction affect her family life, career and communication; they break her as personality and lead towards destruction. There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania.

      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

      "abstract": "Factitious disorders are characterized by self-produced symptoms and a chronic course, sometimes with severe complications. Pathomimia occurs more often in women, even though the Munchausen syndrome is found especially in men. Among the various clinical features of pathomimia, the most frequent are factitious fevers and cutaneous pathomimia. Factitious psychiatric disorders are not rare, such as factitious psychotic symptoms, mournings or post-traumatic stress disorders. The main elements of diagnostic orientation are the odd expression of the reported symptoms, a capricious and disconcerting course, as well as the multiplicity of the previous history, with many imprecise diagnoses. Concerning the psychopathology, and contrary to the simple simulation, immediate utility of the alleged symptoms is not the expected goal, one of the essential psychological motivations being to challenge the physician. Among comorbid pathological personalities, there seems to be some close relations between pathomimia and hysterical personality, whereas the Munchausen syndrome shares common features with antisocial personality.",

      "abstract": "Physical symptoms without any identifiable structural or biochemical abnormalities on detailed clinical examination and investigations, are common in children. Some children may have persistent physical discomfort which can lead to debilitating impact on their academic and social functioning. These children seek repeated medical consultations and are usually subjected to unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures. It is extremely important to understand that emotional factors can contribute to the development as well as maintenance of impairing physical symptoms. There is scientific evidence for the association of anxiety and functional somatic symptoms in children. The diagnostic category which was previously called somatoform disorders is now included in somatic symptom disorders. The main feature of the somatic symptom disorders is the excessive concern with somatic symptoms. These children usually have high level of anxiety. Detailed clinical examination and investigations will not reveal any abnormalities to explain the symptoms. The somatic symptom disorders are common in childhood. Cognitive behavioural therapy by experts in child guidance, will relieve the somatic symptoms related to anxiety and stress. If not intervened at the earliest, the persistent physical symptoms associated with emotional stress will cause significant functional disability in childhood. Unnecessary invasive medical interventions cause more agony to the child. These children also have high risk for developing anxiety disorders and depressive disorders in young adulthood. Hence, early intervention using cognitive behavioural techniques should be provided to all children with somatic symptom disorders, which will definitely improve their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Backache is a common cause of disability, and it is usually associated with structural weakness in the lumbosacral region and with faulty use of the back. Backache is often persistent or recurrent. It is an indication for careful diagnostic history, physical examination, and adequate roentgenograms. Obesity and poor posture may be contributing causes. Other causes of backache should be considered in differential diagnosis. Backache of mechanical origin can be relieved in the vast majority of cases by suitable protective measures, by correction of obesity or faulty posture, by appropriate trunk-muscle exercises, and by training in good posture. Backache unrelieved by these treatments, especially if there is a severe structural defect, for example, spondylolysis, may be relieved by spine fusion. Sciatica is also a common cause of disability. Severe persistent sciatica is commonly due to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus with pressure against the adjacent nerve root, and it may be associated with neurological signs of nerve-root pressure. Tumor of the cauda equina is considered in differential diagnosis. Partial or temporary relief may be obtained by bed rest for two or three weeks if sciatica is due to mild nerve-root pressure. Severe or persistent sciatica due to extrusion of a nucleus pulposus is best relieved by careful surgical removal of the material causing the pressure. The best permanent results are obtained by removal of the entire nucleus pulposus. Spine fusion at the same time will relieve the backache that usually precedes and accompanies disc rupture and will correct structural weakness in the lumbosacral region. Careful evaluation of the patient, meticulous surgical technique, adequate postoperative care, and an appropriate convalescent regimen are essential for a high percentage of good or excellent results.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of Psychosis with Mixed Symptomatology",
      "abstract": "The introduction of potent physical and pharmacological therapies for psychotic conditions has increased the need for accurate diagnosis, not only in terms of assigning a patient to the diagnostic category but of assessing the various trends which may result in a very mixed symptomatology. Therapy, be it physical, pharmacological, or psychotherapeutic directed against one or the other of these components may frequently intensify other symptomatology. A suitable combination of anti-depressant and anti-psychotic drugs plus the use of E.C.T. when indicated is necessary in the management of such cases. In the author's judgment this mixed symptomatology frequently results from the influence of personality trends and conflicts and particularly in these mixed states psychotherapeutic aid must also be included. In the words of Jules Masserman: “Even frankly psychotic behaviour patterns, whether depressive or schizoid, are not as sometimes inferred-merely shapeless fragments from a personality shattered by some hypothetical ‘mental disease’. On the contrary, the psychosis itself is an integrated syndrome which however socially deviant is adaptively operated at all levels from the physiologic to the most abstrusely symbolic.” (3)",

      "title": "A Review on Depressive Disorders in Cancer Patients",
      "abstract": "Cancer turns from a terminal illness to more of a chronic illness. This perspective has broadened the scope of care from treating the disease alone to managing cancer-related symptoms including mental disorders. Among the nosological forms of comorbid mental pathology in cancer patients, affective disorders (depression and anxiety) predominate. While there is no evidence to support a causal role for depression in cancer, it may impact the course of the disease and a person's ability to participate in treatment. Depressive syndromes are highly correlated with a reduced quality of life, increased difficulty managing the course of disease, and earlier admission to inpatient or hospice care. The most common form of depressive symptomatology in people with cancer is an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, sometimes referred to as reactive depression which may be under-recognized and undertreated. More severe symptoms of depression are of clinical concern because of their association with marked distress, more prolonged hospital stays, physical disorders, poorer treatment compliance and adherence to therapy, disability, increased desire for hastened death and completed suicide. Suicidal statements may range from an off-hand comment resulting from frustration or disgust with a treatment course to a reflection of significant despair and an emergent situation. The diagnosis of depression is difficult due to the problems inherent in distinguishing biological or physical symptoms from symptoms of illness or toxic side effects of treatment. A critical part of cancer care is the recognition of the levels of depression present and determination of the appropriate level of intervention, ranging from brief counseling or support groups to medication and/or psychotherapy. At least one half of all people diagnosed with cancer will successfully adapt. Pharmacotherapy for depression in patients with advanced cancer should be guided by a focus on symptom reduction, irrespective of whether the patient meets the diagnostic criteria for major depression. The optimal antidepressant for specific patients can be determined by each patient's depressive symptom profile and potential dual benefit for depression and cancer-related symptoms such as anorexia, insomnia, fatigue, neuropathic pain and hot flashes. Because of both their adverse effect profiles and risk for lethality in overdose, tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A are rarely used in patients with cancer. Timely and precise diagnosis and appropriate treatment of depression is required in an effort not only to increase quality of life but also to reduce adverse effects on cancer course, length of hospital stay, treatment adherence and efficacy and possibly prognosis and survival.",

Current inventories largely do not include obsessions of emotionally injuring others, of diminishing another’s perceived value or worth. This may reflect a low prevalence rate or specific barriers to identification. Hypothesized barriers to clinical identification of emotional injury OCD include the atypically pleasant presentation of characteristic affirming compulsions. Patient self-identification is hypothesized to be diminished by the nature of overt and mental compulsions; for instance, agreeing with others and self-criticism. Recommendations are provided for differential diagnoses with social anxiety and codependency, as well as specific contraindications for common psychotherapeutic approaches. Hypothesized comorbid pathology are presented as opportunities for initial identification of cases.

This is due to negative emotions associated with inability to satisfy certain needs or achieve a particular purpose, which leads to frustration or deprivation in animals. This condition can lead to the emergence of compulsive behaviors, which are often a form of coping with stress. Compulsive behaviors in fur animals are usually stereotypical: animals walk along the cage, catch their own tail, gnaw fur (trichotilomanie), or bite the trellis or the claws. The environmental factors resulting from the maintenance conditions and social relations of the animals in the group play an important role in the emergence of this type of behavior. Another factor that is equally important in causing compulsive behavior is mental strain resulting from disease..",

The growing incidence and cost of this untreated symptom has unfairly condemned many elders to live out their lives at a low level of functioning and has placed unnecessary hardships on their families. This article offers a complete protocol to assess and differentiate arrestible and reversible causes of confusion from irreversible presenile dementia. The history is the most important aspect of the examination of the confused elder. Onset of symptoms, corresponding illness, medication use and time of day that the confusion occurs should be included. Objective data include mental-status exams, but only as a screening tool and stepping stone for other exams. Judgment and abstraction are examined by assessing the client's ability to interpret proverbs and plot a sensible course of action. Special cortical function is assessed by asking the client to draw a house, a clock and a person. A functional pattern assessment specific to the confused elder is included. The general assessment centers on ruling out systemic or mechanical problems in the brain. Possible pathological causes with corresponding lab results, symptoms and clinical data are presented. Confusion is a symptom of many different and often unrelated disease entities. Many of these diseases are preventable, curable or arrestible. A diagnosis of irreversible presenile dementia should never be made without thorough evaluation. The health care provider should refer clients suspected of having irreversible presenile dementia to neurological specialists for confirmation of clinical findings.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :- Gym instructors within the fitness industry play a pivotal role in guiding individuals towards achieving a range of health and fitness goals. In addition to muscular and skeletal health, gym instructors are instrumental in boosting the immune system. Even though they help in maintaining the body gym trainers have a limited knowledge of mechanism of injury, neglecting and repetitive movements of the joint leads to worsening of injury and increase in the pain. Musculoskeletal pain can stem from various sources, including uncommon or repetitive activities that strain muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Additionally, it may result from sudden, jerky movements, falls, fractures, or underlying musculoskeletal conditions. The result of repetitive activities that strain the muscles, tendons and sprain the ligaments. Insufficient recovery time, rapid pace work, repetitive motion patterns, heavy weight lifting, forceful manual exertions, mechanical pressure concentrations or whole body vibrations can lead to development of other musculoskeletal disorders. The impact of a musculoskeletal condition on an individual's quality of life is substantial, extending beyond mere physical discomfort. Such conditions not only affect personal well-being but also impose a considerable financial strain, manifested through compensation payments and lost wages. Instances of sick leave, absenteeism, and even job abandonment contribute to diminished job efficiency,further exacerbating the socioeconomic repercussions of these disorders. METHODOLOGY :- A total of 147 participants were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A consent form was filled by them and the study and questionnaire was explained to them.Self-made Questionnaire was explained to each gym instructors according to language understood by that person as well as google forms were also made available for their convenience.Each gym instructor completed a self administered questionnaire which included information regarding complaints of current shoulder pain. The total data was collected and was statistically analyzed. CONCLUSION :- The Prevalence of shoulder pain in gym instructors is high (78%). The presence of shoulder pain causes a gym instructors to avoid certain activities due to pain which causes a hindrance in their work related activities.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

Though the underlying mechanism still remains unclear, there are two assumptions explaining the associations between somatic symptoms and depression. One is that depression itself causes several somatic symptoms. That is, people with depression may express their mental conflicts in various somatic symptoms. This hypothesis could apply especially to those who have a vague feeling of stigma or prejudice against mental disorders, and who are reluctant to frankly express their mental symptoms. From another point of view, this might mean that some chronic somatic symptoms are magnified due to the person’s depressive state. Another possible hypothesis is that those who have had chronic somatic symptoms of unknown origin, in other words, functional somatic symptoms, are likely to be depressed since they cannot always receive effective medical treatment for such symptoms.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder in Children",
      "abstract": "As a symptom state, nearly all humans have personal experience with the feeling of social anxiety. For most individuals, the feeling state is transitory, or limited to relatively circumscribed developmental periods. For others, social anxiety is a chronic condition resulting in significant functional impairment. Social anxiety disorder is defined in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as a \"marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others\" (1). In order to qualify for a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, children must demonstrate capacity for age-appropriate social relationships. Pervasive developmental disorder must be considered as an alternative diagnosis for children who demonstrate deficits in social relatedness even with family members and others with whom they have extended contact. Further, diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that the child experience anxietyrelated symptoms in the presence of other children, not merely in interaction with adult authority figures. Reticence only in the presence of adults, while potentially disconcerting, falls within the normative scope of shyness and is not necessarily grounds for intervention.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value. Main reasons for referral are a suspected treatable cause for cognitive decline (e.g. delirium), focal neurological deficit (e.g. stroke), suspected dementia under the age of 65-70 years, additional complex somatic or psychiatric disorders or further work-up in non-native speaking people.",

Of special interest are pregnancy-induced changes in disease course or severity and likelihood for baseline recovery of function postpartum. Labor and delivery present special challenges in many conditions that affect skeletal but not smooth (uterine) muscle; so labor complications must be anticipated. Anesthesia for cesarean section surgery requires special precautions in many disorders. The types of conditions reviewed are broad and include examples of autoimmune, hereditary, and compressive/mechanical processes. Disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome and other focal neuropathies, Bell palsy, myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular junction disorders, acute and chronic inflammatory neuropathy, hereditary and acquired muscle diseases, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, channelopathies, autonomic neuropathy, and dysautonomia. Many commonly used therapies have fetal animal but no proven human toxicity concerns, complicating treatment and risk decisions. Weaning off effective therapeutic agents or preemptive aggressive treatment or surgery prior to planned pregnancy is an option in some conditions.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by intense fatigue, with duration of over six months and associated to other related symptoms. The latter include asthenia and easily induced tiredness that is not recovered after a night's sleep. The fatigue becomes so severe that it forces a 50% reduction in daily activities. Given its unknown aetiology, different hypotheses have been considered to explain the origin of the condition (from immunological disorders to the presence of post-traumatic oxidative stress), although there are no conclusive diagnostic tests. Diagnosis is established through the exclusion of other diseases causing fatigue. This syndrome is rare in childhood and adolescence, although the fatigue symptom per se is quite common in paediatric patients. Currently, no curative treatment exists for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The therapeutic approach to this syndrome requires a combination of different therapeutic modalities. The specific characteristics of the symptomatology of patients with chronic fatigue require a rapid adaptation of the educational, healthcare and social systems to prevent the problems derived from current systems. Such patients require multidisciplinary management due to the multiple and different issues affecting them. This document was realized by one of the Interdisciplinary Work Groups from the Institute for Rare Diseases, and its aim is to point out the main social and care needs for people affected with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. For this, it includes not only the view of representatives for different scientific societies, but also the patient associations view, because they know the true history of their social and sanitary needs. In an interdisciplinary approach, this work also reviews the principal scientific, medical, socio-sanitary and psychological aspects of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.",

Many of these conditions are located to cervical or suboccipital muscles and constitute a separate group in the classification scheme for chronic pain published in Pain (Merskey, 1986). The pain appears to originate in muscles or connective tissue associated with muscle. The aetiology is not known, but parameters indicating a negative emotional state (depression, anxiety), stressful conditions at home or at work (time pressure, emotional conflicts, perceived poor psychosocial work environment) or mechanical stress (posture, repetitive work tasks) are often shown to correlate with the pain condition (Holm et al., 1986; Ellertsen & Kløve, 1987; Kamwendo, Linton & Moritz, 1991; Winkel & Westgaard, 1992).",

Severe depression also occurs as a comorbid illness with other mental illnesses and usually gets a chronic course.The Report of the World Health Organization from 2015 can be concluded that the Republic of Northern Macedonia has not submitted data on the prevalence and incidence of Severe Depressive Disorder.

Regarding depression as just the defined episode when patients meet the criteria for diagnosis, ignores the fluctuating character of the illness and the role of the patient. The patient is, after all, the one who decides if and when the symptoms experienced are important enough to seek medical assistance. How a patient with depression should be treated, and whether or not and to whom the patient should be referred, depends on more than just the severity of the depression. This is because severity involves more than just the number of symptoms when the depression was first diagnosed. Ineffective coping behaviour and lack of social support both negatively influence the course of depression and if the initial treatment is not effective enough, the episode will be prolonged. The interest and skills of the general practitioners as well as the expectations and former experiences of the patient play a major role in deciding whether to refer a patient to secondary care.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

Thus, certain signs and symptoms generally associated with lesions of the cerebellum may be produced by destructive injuries of the cerebrum. Bruns<sup>1</sup>long ago called attention to ataxia with tumors of the frontal lobes in the absence of disturbance of voluntary motion, of muscular sense or of the reflexes. A certain amount of passivity also may be found in these cases.

      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Intense or chronic stress can have long-lasting consequences in an individual's health, and can be the cause of debilitating mental illnesses. A very common mental illness induced by traumatic stress is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a syndrome of symptoms indicative of emotional dysfunction, which develop after exposure to life-threatening events, or very stressful situations of different nature. Prevalent symptoms are fear and anxiety, which become particularly intense during exposure to situations reminiscent of the traumatic events that precipitated the disease. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder of considerable prevalence and morbidity and can affect persons of any age and ethnic or socioeconomic background. It is, unfortunately, a far too common result of participation in wars. In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that the prevalence of PTSD is even higher in inner city communities exposed to compound community trauma. It is imperative, therefore, to understand the neurobiological mechanisms by which exposure to traumatic stress leads to PTSD in order to foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD. Clinical evidence indicates that certain stress-related affective disorders such as PTSD are associated with changes in the amygdala's excitability. The amygdala is a key component of the brain's neuronal network that determines the emotional significance of external events",

We report three cases of adolescents who were admitted to general paediatrics services for abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting with a negative medical workup. In each case, a clear psychosocial stressor was evident. It is possible that somatic symptoms without clear medical causes may reflect psychosocial stress, but it is difficult to discern whether the psychosocial issues preceded the somatic complaints or were a result of them. Making an accurate diagnosis is difficult, and broaching such a subject with patients and their families is a delicate matter. More research is needed to determine appropriate screening tools for identifying cases where psychosocial stress may play a relevant role in symptom presentation, as well as potential treatment modalities for such cases.",

Therefore, it is not surprising for patients with SCI to develop mental health problems, such as depression and/or anxiety. Depressive symptoms include agitation, restlessness, fatigue, changes in appetite, helplessness, loss of interest as well as problems in sleeping. The presence of depression has been connected with extended length of hospitalization and development of secondary medical complications, as well as reduced quality of life (QOL) and self-efficacy. The purpose of this review is to investigate the existing literature to identify the effect of depression on hospitalization and rehabilitation in patients with SCI. From the 31 studies included in this paper, it is obvious that SCI patients with depression have longer periods of hospitalization and/or rehabilitation as well as worse functional outcomes. Moreover, it was shown that SCI individuals with depressive symptoms frequently develop other secondary medical complications which subsequently affect the length of stay and the rehabilitation outcomes. Acknowledging these facts can improve diagnosis and intervention, which may also improve the patient’s recovery outcome.",

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

Various health theories - biomedical, ability-based, biopsychosocial - are introduced and scrutinized from the point of view of enactivism and phenomenology. Health is ultimately argued to consist in a central world-disclosing aspect of what is called existential feelings, experienced by way of transparency and ease in carrying out important life projects. Health, in such a phenomenologically enacted understanding, is an important and in many cases necessary part of leading a good life. Illness, on the other hand, by such a phenomenological view, consist in finding oneself at mercy of unhomelike existential feelings, such as bodily pains, nausea, extreme unmotivated tiredness, depression, chronic anxiety and delusion, which make it harder and, in some cases, impossible to flourish. In illness suffering the lived body hurts, resists, or, in other ways, alienates the activities of the ill person.",

Laborer contingency is claimed, but it is denied in the first instance by the Mutual of occupational accidents and diseases. In Spain, the legal definition of an accident at work has been developed by case-law in virtually all the elements that constitute it. It contemplates the concept of gainful employment, damage or injury caused, of physical and mental injury, and it deems as injury or accident not only what results from the sudden and violent action of an external agent on the human body, but also the damage that comes from certain diseases such as internal processes, sudden or slow action, or arising or originating from the job. With common diseases such as epilepsy, the lack of a strict or direct causal link between epilepsy and work does not preclude any legal presumption to the harmful results caused by seizures in the place and time of the job (death or injuries from falls caused by the crisis), as these may have occurred during work.",

Is alexithymia a pathology of affect or a character neurosis; is it primary or secondary; genetic or developmental? Is it an adaptational deformation related to social class and low psychological sophistication, a life style or a cerebral deficit? Is it global and consistent (trait) or partial and temporary (state)? Is it part of the necessary and sufficient condition for the development of a psychosomatic symptom or is it a nonspecific autoplastic alteration? It is quite possible that alexithymia is one of several mediating processes between stress and disease along with genetic susceptibility, developmental variables, context and reaction to untoward life events, coping dispositions, psychosocial support and sociocultural factors. Therapeutic approaches would depend on whether we are dealing with a primary affectless condition or a secondary one. A differential diagnosis is essential since self-numbing following psychic trauma or a pathological grief, masked and atypical depression are treatable. Blocking of affect may have dire effects on the psychosomatic economy and on the capacity for intimacy. Muscular and psychological rigidity, weariness, ennui and anhedonia may be the only clues to the presence of alexithymia. Since we may be dealing with a spectrum disorder, there is no single treatment modality. There are no controlled studies on the use of psychotropic drugs and psychoanalytic-oriented and behavioral approaches have been shown to be of some benefit.",

Certain factors, like disease, stress, personality, alcohol, and medication, may turn this normal activity into a condition that might include abnormal tooth wear, myofascial pain, and temporomandibular joint problems. This condition then corresponds with bruxism. Bruxism and masticatory muscle pain may reciprocally influence one another: although not a compulsory finding, bruxism may be associated with the predisposition, initiation, and perpetuation of temporomandibular disorders and orofacial pain. On the other hand, the presence of jaw muscle pain may reduce bruxism motor activity. Research on the integrity and nature of the relationship between bruxism and pain is hampered by controversies that exist regarding definition, diagnostic criteria, and measurement techniques. Moreover, the pathophysiology of bruxism and its association with other sleep-related and movement disorders are still unclear. Consequently, there is no real cure for bruxism, although several treatments may be used to control its adverse effects. However, there is very limited research to support the efficacy of behavioral, physical, dental, pharmacological, and orthopedic treatments. Probably the best current treatment modality for bruxism is the occlusal stabilization splint. Although such an orthopedic device may not actually prevent bruxism, it may help to reduce its symptoms.",

A core issue is the resulting multifaceted presentation of somatic, psychological and social problems in the same individual, leading to severe functional limitations and participation restrictions. Chronic pain considers one from the highest symptoms for torture survivors. This literature review of 25 studies will focus on the neurophysiology, and sensitivity of the nervous system after experiencing torture, the changes that happened at the brain level, and the pain system from a neuroscience point of view, and then the study will highlight the evidence-based practice for biopsychosocial intervention for torture survivors in treating chronic pain. The study findings and conclusion show that torture causes noticeable alterations to the brain and nervous system that manifest in the survivors as high PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, feelings of disempowerment, lack of control, personal boundaries being destroyed, or stress, with intermittent or continuous physiological hyperarousal. The classic fight-or-flight response to a perceived threat is a reflexive nervous phenomenon that has obvious survival advantages in evolutionary terms. When a person experiences severe circumstances like torture, which is often accompanied by intense fear, horror, and helplessness, the systems that organize the constellation of reflexive survival behaviors become dysregulated and hypersensitive like critical anatomical and neurophysiological alteration and chronic changes in the pain system, so, it’s mandatory for the rehabilitation team to understand these changes and create a setting that takes into consideration these experiences. Research on chronic pain aims to understand the various risks and protective influences of biological, psychological, and environmental factors that are known to contribute to chronic pain disorders after torture.",

      "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, characterized by emotional, behavioral, cognitive and/or social disability, is an important condition to those providing mental health treatment worldwide. With no safe level of alcohol consumption found during pregnancy, symptoms at the severe end of the spectrum can be obvious, easily diagnosed and extremely debilitating; at the mild end of the spectrum the disabilities may be subtle, and often attributed to other causes. Common symptomatology in an individual with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders includes: attention problems, impulsivity, mood disorders, conduct and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms, drug and alcohol problems, impaired executive functioning, memory disturbances, learning disabilities, poor social skills and reduced ability to function independently as an adult. Because of the lack of widespread knowledge of this disorder by mental health providers, especially in the absence of mental retardation or dysmorphic features, individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often not identified as having an organically based mental health, and/or cognitive disorder; thus reduces their ability to qualify for special support services found to improve long-term outcome. Despite the great need for neuropsychiatric treatment research that could lead to improved fetal alcohol spectrum disorders targeted multilevel mental health, and social support services, there is much the mental health professional can provide at this time to improve the lives of these individuals. Accordingly, the mental health community needs to be prepared, as the disorder becomes more widely recognized by affected patients and their families; they will be requesting formal diagnoses and sensitive, creative options to prenatal alcohol related problems in all areas of neuropsychiatric treatment.",

Circumstances, personality and psychiatric illness may amplify (and less commonly mute) volunteered pain scores. Most pain is organically initiated and then psychologically contaminated. The psychological and psychiatric factors influencing pain scores will be considered. Patients with a propensity to somatise may elaborate and/or maintain ‘organic’ pain. This occurs ‘unconsciously’ (without awareness). This process deceives the patient (and often also the doctor). Intentional amplification of pain and the construction of pain behaviours for care‐eliciting purpose (factitious disorder) or personal gain (malingering) deceives others. Though there are clinical clues to feigned pains able to be obtained from the history and signs such as those proposed by Waddell, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate partial malingering, conversion or somatoform pain and the pain signature of the particular patient. If the intent of symptom formation and its continuance is psychological, medicine has a diagnostic role. If the intent is for personal greed or is criminal, the diagnosis rests upon legal issues.",

      "title": "A narrative review of risk factors and predictors for poor outcome and prolonged recovery after a mild traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are often caused by a blow to the head or a sudden jolt resulting in a wide range of physical, cognitive, and emotional temporary symptoms. Mild TBI diagnosis can be challenging and most commonly followed by post-concussion syndrome (PCS). When the symptoms are present for more than 3 months, prolonged post-concussive syndrome (PPCS) can be suspected. This review aims to identify and summarize the current status of the knowledge regarding the risk factors and predictors of the recovery from PCS and PPCS. A comprehensive search of the main scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed using keywords, such as: 'prolonged post-concussion syndrome', combined with 'risk factors', 'predictors', and 'outcomes'. Multiple studies reported more than one risk factor for PPCS development following mTBIs that were generally the results of sports-related concussions and car accidents. The most prevalent risk factor associated with PPCS was the female sex. Social factors/personality traits, anxiety, mental health disorders, or other health conditions from their past medical history, the occurrence of headache/migraines during TBI recovery, somatization, physical activity, and litigation were also reported to contribute to PPCS risk. An exhaustive approach is required to mitigate the risk of PPCS and to ensure optimal recovery after concussive events. However, larger prospective cohort studies evaluating patients that were examined and treated with standardized protocols could be needed to further validate these associations and mandate the highest risk factors for delayed recovery.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a subjective state of overwhelming, sustained exhaustion and decreased capacity for physical and mental work that is not relieved by rest. Cancer-related fatigue has many causes. Included in the causes are the illness itself, the side effects of virtually every treatment, depression, and other biopsychosocial factors. As a result, fatigue is the most common symptom reported by cancer patients in most descriptive studies. In addition to arising from multiple etiologies, fatigue is also multidimensional in its manifestation and impact. Its effect on the quality of life of the patient is comparable to that of pain. Experienced by most patients as an extremely frustrating state of chronic energy depletion, it leads to loss of productivity which can reduce self-esteem. As a subtle and chronic symptom, it also places people at risk for being questioned about the veracity of their complaints, particularly during the post-treatment, disease-free survival period. Patients themselves are reluctant to complain of fatigue, perhaps because they believe little can be done about it, or they wish to avoid drawing attention away from treating their cancer.",

      "abstract": "Obsessions (e.g. usually associated with blasphemous thoughts) dominate the psyche of those afflicted with OCD until relief comes with a connected compulsive activity (i.e., another thought process, or action). OCD is disabling as to the time and mental energy it consumes. The disorder is characterized by repeated hand washing (the “Pontius Pilot Syndrome”), checking, and ordering. In some instances, these symptoms of OCD can have positive overtones and make a more productive and exacting worker. For example, dentist with OCD probably does more accurate restorations due to a “checker” inclination. Professions depending on industriousness and problem-solving like physician or scientist are custom-made for those with OCD. However, severe observable symptomology and often a dehabilitating decrease in functionality usually occur in those with the disorder. Nonetheless, those afflicted with OCD are quite skilled at hiding their symptoms from others; often including their employer or spouse. In addition, those with OCD usually have one or more depressive episodes or must also deal with chronic depression.

It is important to understand that stress impacts psychological, physiological, immunological, and behavioral functions that not only require individual coping strategies but affect disease onset and/or progression in both humans and animals. Integrative studies have demonstrated significant consequences of stress on metabolic, cardiovascular, mental, and reproductive health as well as individual fitness and immune modulation. It is apparent that there exist many similarities between humans and animals encountering a stressful stimulus. Individual variation in stress susceptibility is related to genetic predisposition and early experience. This chapter provides an overview on stress concepts, physiological cascades, and stress-related diseases.",

Like other rare disease patients, individuals with CHH/KS frequently experience feelings of isolation, shame and alienation. Unlike many rare diseases, CHH/KS is not life threatening and effective treatments are available. Nevertheless, it remains a profoundly life-altering condition with psychosocial distress on a par with untreatable or life-limiting disease. Patients with CHH/KS frequently express lasting adverse psychological, emotional, social and psychosexual effects resulting from disrupted puberty. They also frequently experience a ‘diagnostic odyssey’, characterized by distressing and convoluted medical referral pathways, lack-of-information, misinformation, and sometimes-incorrect diagnoses. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment-initiation can significantly contribute to poor body image and self-esteem. Such experiences can erode confidence and trust in medical professionals as well as undermine long-term adherence to treatment - with negative sequelae on health and wellbeing. This review provides a summary of the psychological aspects of CHH/KS and outlines an approach to comprehensive care that spans medical management as well as appropriate attention, care and referrals to peer-to-peer support and mental health services to ameliorate the psychological aspects of CHH/KS.",

A common characteristic is the presence of obsessions leading to anxiety or other forms of affective distress, and compulsions, which are performed to diminish the anxiety or distress. However, there is growing evidence for the role of habit forming in OCD. That questions the role of affective symptoms in OCD, such as anxiety or disgust. However affective symptoms, in particular depressive symptoms and anxiety, also occur during the course of OCD. How do affective symptoms and obsessive-compulsive symptoms relate to each other during the longterm course of OCD? These questions were investigated during provoked obessive-compulsive symptoms as well as during the six-years-course of OCD. The conclusion is that affective symptoms have an important role regarding the experience and the course of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms and that affective and obsessive-compulsive symptoms affect each other during the longterm course of OCD.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: Ciertos sectores económicos en pandemia establecieron el decremento de la carga física de los trabajadores, relacionadas con sus tareas de carácter manual; éstas a la vez, fueron reemplazadas por el incremento permanente de actividades vinculadas a funciones cognitivas y psicosociales que se corresponden íntimamente a la carga mental, que se constituye en uno de los factores de mayor influencia para el riesgo laboral y adquiere gran interés, esencialmente por las nuevas formas de organización del trabajo; así como también, los avances tecnológicos e informáticos, que demandan de mayores esfuerzos cognoscitivos e intelectuales. La carga mental genera tensiones en el trabajador, provocadas por distintas variables concernientes a los requerimientos laborales; dada la relación que se produce entre éstas y las capacidades mentales o recursos propios de la persona para afrontarlas, junto con los procesos cognitivos y aspectos afectivos del individuo.Se han descrito efectos en la salud y ciertos componentes de riesgo mental se expresan como síntomas depresivos y estrés, afines con otros elementos específicos de las profesiones como: agotamiento, cansancio físico y fatiga generalizada, lesiones musculares, perturbación del sueño y exposición a situaciones y comportamientos de violencia en el contexto laboral. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), ha reconocido que el bienestar de los trabajadores, no solo se condiciona por peligros en el lugar de trabajo, sino también por factores sociales e individuales. Las consecuencias que surgen a raíz de los intentos por superar las condiciones precarias que enfrenta el trabajador, llevan a una connotación negativa de las cargas físicas, psíquicas y fisiológicas, que a futuro se manifiestan en cargas mentales excesivas difíciles de manejar lo que genera un decrecimiento en la productividad. En Ecuador, las políticas públicas, no han considerado aún la salud mental como parte de la salud pública; de ahí, la necesidad de iniciar su discusión, análisis y propuesta.Objetivo: El estudio tiene como propósito fundamental determinar los factores asociados a la carga mental de los docentes de diferentes niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico, conforme a la normativa vigente ecuatoriana.Materiales y Métodos: Se aplicó una metodología con enfoque cuantitativo. Fue aplicado el cuestionario CarMen-Q que evalúa cuatro dimensiones de carga mental: dimensión cognitiva, temporales, requisitos de desempeño y aspectos emocionales. Consta de 29 ítems, con un formato de respuesta mediante Escala Likert. El instrumento se aplicó en línea a 111 docentes de Ecuador de niveles educativos: básico, medio, superior universitario y superior técnico. Para analizar los resultados se recurrió a técnicas estadísticas multivariantes como Análisis de Componentes Principales y estadística descriptiva para análisis de los datos socio demográficos.Resultados: Los resultados sugieren que los factores asociados a la carga mental, se relacionan con la gestión de información, la dimensión emocional, carga laboral y la presión por rendimiento, al que deben responder en este caso los docentes de las instituciones educativas investigados.Conclusiones: Los docentes enfrentan dificultades para responder a las demandas de las tareas. Estas, están directamente relacionadas con las dimensiones cognitivas, de rendimiento y temporales, sin dejar de lado, aquellas vinculadas con la subjetividad humana como corresponde a las emociones, sentimientos y vivencias, más aún cuando el ejercicio de la docencia involucra la interacción directa entre seres humanos.",

      "abstract": "Background\r\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reported by patients (between 50% and 92%; Krupp 2006, Weiland et al. 2015). The Multiple Sclerosis Council (1998) defines fatigue as “a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities”. Fatigue limits the ability to participate in everyday activities, work, leisure and social participation and is considered to be one of the main causes of impaired quality of life among persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) independent from depression or disability (Jackson et al. 1991). \r\nPrimary fatigue refers to fatigue in absence of an apparent cause and it is specific of MS whereas secondary fatigue is a consequence of other concomitant conditions (e.g. psychological disturbances, musculoskeletal problems, sleep disorders and medication side effects), which may be related to MS but also to other diseases. The pathophysiology of primary fatigue in MS is highly complex and, so far, not completely understood. To date, the best therapeutic approach seems to be a multidisciplinary management involving exercise therapy, self-management and education in conjunction with medication (Rottoli et al., 2016, Kos et al., 2016). \r\nTwo meta-analyses provide moderate to strong evidence for fatigue management education (or energy management education) based on energy conservation strategies and cognitive behavioural therapy to reduce the impact of fatigue on occupational performance and quality of life (Asano et al., 2014, Blikman et al., 2013). The treatment protocols used in these clinical trials (Vanage et al. 2003, Sauter et al. 2008, Mathiowetz et al. 2005, Finlayson et al. 2011, Hugos et al. 2010, Kos et al. 2007) are all based on the 6-week group-based program developed by Packer et al. (1995), carried out in outpatient setting and delivered by trained occupational therapists. The typical features of this program are stable groups with 6-12 participants, hierarchical construction of the issues, 4-6 group sessions (±2h x week, total 12 hours) and homework between the group sessions to apply the energy conservation strategies and to implement a behavioural change. At the moment the evidence for in inpatient settings (Wendebourg et al. 2016, Van Kessel K. et al., 2008) or individual treatments (Kos et al., 2016) with the same issues are inconclusive due to the small sample size. \r\nDespite good evidence for fatigue management education programs, their limited external validity has prevented the implementation of these treatment protocols in Switzerland and other European countries. They are currently not available for pwMS in these countries. The main reasons are the absence of locally specialized OTs and no translated and culturally adapted treatment programs as well as a miss match between the organisational needs of the regional healthcare organizations and the treatment protocols. In Switzerland multidisciplinary rehabilitation for pwMS is delivered mostly in specialized rehabilitation centres, where pwMS spend three to four weeks as inpatients yearly or biennially. During the rest of the year, pwMS maintain their normal busy life which often includes (part-time) paid and/or family work. At best, they receive physiotherapy in the meantime, but they have no access to specialized OTs due to time, energy and availability constraints. \r\nUntil now, no program has focused on treating inpatients in dynamic group compositions over a shorter period (three weeks) but with higher frequency and has allowed participants to stream into the group continuously whenever being admitted which is necessary for successful implementation in the rehabilitation context. Information is missing whether such treatment characteristics are feasible in the inpatient setting and how these would be perceived by pwMS.\r\nProject aims \r\nThe project is divided into two distinct parts. \r\nThe aim of Part 1 was the development of an evidence based energy management education (EME) treatment protocol in German and a training concept in using EME for occupational therapists, followed by a test run with 10-15 pwMS and 3 OTs, evaluation of the experiences and optimization of the treatment protocol and the training protocol of OTs. Additionally, a feasibility study for the evaluation of the efficacy of EME was prepared.\r\nThe aim of Part 2 is to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for EME in terms of processes, procedures, resource management and scientific metrics by a pilot-run with 40 pwMS. \r\nAfter the validation of the treatment protocol low-threshold courses for occupational therapist will be provided to facilitate a broad implementation so as to assure the availability for many pwMS.\r\nProject partners and finances\r\nThis project is a cooperation of the Stiftung Kliniken Valens with the Rehabilitation Research Laboratory 2rLab of the University of Applied Sciences (SUPSI) in Manno. Part 1 was partly financed by the Swiss Occupational Therapy Association and the “Stiftung Ergotherapie Zurich”. Part 2 is partly financed by the Swiss MS-Association. The execution of this project is enabled by SUPSI and Kliniken Valens.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology of Chronic Pain",
      "abstract": "Acute pain hurts and most often is the result of tissue injury. Chronic pain also hurts. Although those who suffer from chronic pain also tend to associate the onset with an injury, illness, or surgical procedure; the root cause is far more complex. Chronic pain most often does not follow dermatomal distributions associated with any injury, disease or surgical procedure. And more often than not, chronic pain sufferers also suffer from various forms of depression and/or anxiety. The process of central sensitization resulting from tissue injury has been elucidated, as has many of the molecular changes within the brain that perpetuate chronic pain. Genetics, epigenetics, environmental stressors, and emotional stressors all play roles to varying degrees in the development of the chronic pain state. This article explores how synaptic memories form in the brain as a result of both physical and emotional traumas (multiple hits) resulting in progression to chronic pain, because of failure of the brain’s descending modulatory mechanisms to prevent or control “the pain”.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary. Given, as needed, mild sedatives, certain forms of specific treatment in specific conditions, general measures and good hygiene and sympathetic understanding, the patient may be expected to recover or improve.",

There is an emergency when this is felt by any of the protagonists: the patient, the doctor or the entourage. The response in the environment can be indifferent, aggravating or pacifying. The behavioural outbursts in the agitated and aggressive situations necessitate a symptomatic treatment of the agitation, investigation of the underlying somatic or psychiatric pathology, and an evaluation of the milleu often at the origin of the aggravation or agitation. New types of emergency psychiatric consultations are currently being observed, underlaid by outbursts of anxieties and anguish, and this occuring across the board. Patients with diverse pathological anxieties arrive in the emergency department with an imperative demand to be relieved.

An important element of the clinical picture is also neurocognitive impairment. The most common treatment methods for depression and anxiety are pharmacology, psychotherapy or a combination of both methods. The data from literature show that those treatment methods lead to an improvement of clinical symptoms, but they exert a possible impact on cognitive functions. However the study results referring both to the role of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy in this domain are still inconsistent. There is an increasing number of accessible data confirming the positive effects of those clinical interventions on cognitive functioning of anxiety and depressive patients, but the interpretation is complicated because of differences in methodology as well as examined sample size and their characteristics.

When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated.

      "abstract": "The physician, like any other human being, is subject to emotional problems, greed, jealousy, and instability of an individual under stress as well as mental disease which may all bring out improper behavior or criminal activity. Over the last two centuries, there have been instances where physicians have committed deliberate acts of murder on wives, relatives, patients, and others. Their motivation has ranged from ridding themselves of a nagging wife or for insurance and inheritance gains to insane acts. The methods used have usually been associated with poisons and drugs, of which the physician may have great familiarity. The frequency of physician-involved murders seems to have increased in the past two decades with several sensational cases being the topics of media coverage and further review in books and visual media, including television and the movies. The investigation of these cases may be very difficult, especially when a drug may be given to a victim which could cause severe problems after small amounts are given. The detection of death as being a murder may be the first problem faced, the demonstration of the fatal agent in the body in the next problem, and probably the most difficult is finding a suspect with the medication in his or her possession or paraphenalia for injecting such as a syringe and needle. The stealth and cunning of the murderer may further complicate the picture for the investigator as well as the reputation of the physician in the community, which is often above reproach so that the public has to be convinced of the actual involvement of the suspect.",

      "title": "Exercise Intolerance: How Do We Know and Test?",
      "abstract": "Exercise intolerance is defined as the reduced ability to perform activities involving movement of skeletal muscles due to symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue. Patients can be suffered during exercise or later. Dogs presented to veterinarians for perceived exercise intolerance may have decreased strength, speed, or stamina. Signs can sometimes be subtle, with suboptimal performance detected by the owner but it is difficult to detect by inexperienced observers. Alternatively, the signs may include profound exercise-induced weakness, episodes of collapse, or even death following exercise. Exercise intolerance can result from cardiovascular, orthopedic, respiratory, hematologic, metabolic/endocrine, neuromuscular, muscular and neurologic disorders. Therefore, a veterinarian has to utilize information received from history taking, physical examination, and some particular diagnostic tools/tests in order to find the etiology. A complete history investigating abnormalities of all body system is essential. It is important to clarify nature of clinical signs and to determine whether clinical signs are associated with physical activity. If possible, a veterinarian should observe the dog during an episode that the owner perceives as exercise intolerance directly or from a videotape. Clinical signs of coughing, dyspnea, collapse, or cyanosis may suggest cardiovascular, respiratory or neurologic dysfunction. Physical examination at rest should be performed since many dogs with exercise intolerance have abnormal physical examination findings at rest. Complete examination of respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and nervous system are advised. It is important to systematically rule out of each previously mentioned system. Cardiovascular disorder: Dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) regardless the cause will eventually have exercise intolerance due to pumping failure and poor tissue perfusion. Consequently, tissues do not receive adequate oxygen and the muscles fatigue more easily. These dogs will typically display clinical evidence of cardiac failure at rest, including tachycardia, cough, weak femoral pulses, crackles on lung auscultation from pulmonary congestion or edema, and perhaps cyanosis and a murmur, arrhythmia, pulse deficits, and prolonged capillary refill time may be observed. Standard diagnostic methods for CVS disorder including auscultation, thoracic radiographs, ECG and Echocardiography should be all performed. Abnormal serum lactate may be found in dogs with muscle fatigue. The sixminute walk test (6-MWT) has been a gold standard method in human medicine to predict morbidity and mortality of patient with heart failure. The 6-MWT directly measures a patient’s ability to carry out daily activities instead of a patient’s ability to performed laboratory exercise such as on treadmill. The 6-MWT in dogs is also evidenced and demonstrated a significant decreased in the distance walked in 6 minutes when a dog has CHF. This method is simple and may be a valuable tool when assessing quality of life in CHF dogs. Respiratory disorder: Defects of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, airways, pulmonary parenchyma, or pleural space can impair a dog's ability to breathe normally. When these dogs exercise, they are unable to maintain tissue oxygenation resulting in weakness, exercise intolerance, or collapse. Cyanosis, abnormal lung sounds, abnormal upper airway sounds, or dyspnea may be recognized. Observation of breathing pattern and auscultation at rest, during and after exercise are helpful in identifying a problem within the respiratory tract. Thoracic radiographs should be done in all dogs with exercise intolerance. In addition, heartworm testing, laryngoscopy, tracheal wash for cytology and culture, thoracocentesis or bronchoscopy and arterial blood gas should be performed to evaluate the respiratory system as necessary to reach a diagnosis. Hematologic disorder: Regardless of any cause resulting in bleeding, dogs usually will not exhibit exercise intolerance due to anemia unless their hematocrit fall below 20%. Dogs may exhibit a sudden collapse or profound weakness rather than repeated episodes of inability to exercise. Chronic anemia can be tolerated but, if severe, can result in classic signs of exercise intolerance. Chronic anemia is most often seen in urinary bleeding, bone marrow disease or cancer. All dogs with exercise intolerance should be tested for a complete blood count. Abnormality of metabolic/endocrine system: Hypoglycemia is an important cause of weakness and exercise intolerance in dogs. Most often causes of hypoglycemia in dogs include tumors of pancreases, liver failure, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism. Hypoglycemia should be documented by collecting a blood sample at the time of collapse. However, intense hypoglycemia is most likely to be verified after a 24or 48-hour fast. If hypoglycemia is confirmed, affected dogs should be tested for hypoadrenocorticism, liver dysfunction, and neoplasia. Thoracic radiographs and abdominal Proceedings of the 14 Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Conference CUVC 2015: Responsible for Lives April 20-22, 2015, Bangkok, Thailand 6 ultrasonography are recommended to confirm metastasis. Neuromuscular abnormalities: Myasthenia Gravis is an immune-mediated disorder in which selfantibodies attack acetylcholine receptors of skeletal muscle. The clinical signs of affected dogs include weakness of limbs muscle that become worsen when dogs exercise. Dogs with MG usually exhibit severe exercise intolerant, developing weakness and collapse even after walking only a few steps. Response to edrophonium chloride may help to establish a clinical diagnosis of myasthenia gravis while the results of confirmative antibody against are also required. Serum antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are detected in most dogs with MG. Orthopedic disorders: Pain from abnormalities of the bones or joints causes reluctance to exercise in affected dog. Besides reluctance to walk or exercise, other clinical signs include, fever, and lethargy. Lameness, joint swelling, and joint pain can be inconsistent, so best diagnosis is to perform arthrocentesis with cytology and bacterial culture. There are many etiologies of orthopedics disorder. Therefore, a veterinarian must differential diagnosis based on history and physical examination. For instance, hypertrophic osteodystrophy, or osteochondritis dissecans often found in young dogs. Whereas, aged dogs may have problems with ligamentous injuries or degenerative joint disease. Polyarthritis is another most common causes of joint pain and reluctance to exercise in dogs. Immunemediated nonerosive polyarthritis (IMPA) is the most common cause of polyarthritis in dogs. In conclusion, Diagnostic evaluation of dogs with exercise intolerance will vary based on determination historical features, physical exam findings at rest and also laboratory results. If there are no abnormalities at rest, a veterinarian may let dogs to perform exercise. It is important to further investigate the underlying problem systematically to rule out metabolic, orthopedic, respiratory and/or cardiac causes of exercise intolerance as well as muscular, neuromuscular and neurologic disorders. Once the cause of exercise intolerance has been identified, plans for treatment or management can be initiated. References 1. Boddy KN et al 2004. Am J Vet Res. 65(3): 311- 313. 2. Chan DL. 2008.

Migraine and post-traumatic headache share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, and both can considerably decrease quality of life. The development of post-traumatic headache or post-traumatic migraine must be differentiated from concussion, and requires specific management to address headache manifestations. Although there are no approved pharmacologic treatments specific to post-traumatic headache, emerging strategies focus on treatment paradigms similar to migraine management. Failure to address post-traumatic headache and post-traumatic migraine will lead to prolonged post-concussive symptoms and the misunderstanding that such prolonged symptoms are a result of incomplete recovery from concussion.",

      "abstract": "'Stress' is a familiar concept that upon analysis becomes a very difficult term to define, for it is necessary to consider the stimulus, the internal reactions to the stimulus, and the responses of the individual to the stimulus. Some assess stress on the basis of the changes in adrenal hormone secretion produced by a particular stimulus, thus focusing attention upon the response rather than the stimulus, but individuals do not all react in the same way so that a stimulus that is stressful to one is ignored, disregarded or not reacted to by another. Other investigators prefer to regard a particular stimulus (which they then call a stressor) as uniformly stressful, even though some individuals may not react in the anticipated manner, and some hardly at all. Surgery powerfully activates the hypothalamo—pituitary—adrenocortical system, and thus raises the output of the adrenal steroid cortisol, but the prospect of surgery can be just as effective, as can admission to hospital, the prospect of a college or university examination, or the expectation of exhausting physical exercise. On the one hand the physiological response to stress, as after injury, is of greatest concern, while on the other psychological factors, as in the assessment of the degree of personal threat, is paramount. Because of difficulties in classifying the stimuli, greater regard has been paid to the physiological response, but with repeated exposure to stress adaptation may occur, so complicating definition of a stress.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is recognised that the commonest organic cause for impotence is diabetes. It must be appreciated however, that the aetiology of impotence in diabetes can be due to a variety of factors that cover the whole spectrum of impotence. The problem may be primarily neurogenic, vasculogenic or a combination of these factors. In addition, impotence in the diabetic may be contributed to or caused by diuretic or antihypertensive medication, a penile abnormality such as Peyronie's disease or be purely psychogenic. Whatever the possible organic basis for the problem, an additional psychogenic overlay is likely. It is apparent therefore that a comprehensive medical history and specific detailed psychosexual history are required, together with a relevant clinical examination and screening before a likely cause or causes can be identified and appropriate treatment instituted. This cannot readily be undertaken in a busy outpatient department and time must be made available for the impotent patient to be comprehensively counselled in a specially designated clinic.",

      "title": "Quality of Life of Older Adults with Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "Health-related quality of life is now recognized as an important patient outcome in response to a disease, treatment, or procedure. The term health-related quality of life (HRQL) refers to a multidimensional construct involving the individual's evaluation or judgment about subjective well-being and objective attributes of functioning. Although there are varying definitions of HRQL, a group of international experts agreed that the fundamental dimensions of HRQL are physical, mental/psychological, and social health, as well as global perceptions of function and well-being.1 Other dimensions of HRQL might also be important, depending on the purpose of an investigation and the specific health condition being studied. These dimensions include cognitive or neuropsychologic functioning, sexual functioning and intimacy, personal productivity, symptoms, pain, energy/vitality, sleep, and self-esteem. Urinary incontinence and its associated symptoms can have a significant impact on the HRQL of older adults. Evidence suggests that incontinence can affect HRQL in diverse and far-reaching ways and that there is considerable variability among individuals in their perceptions and responses to urinary symptoms.2 In addition, there are differences in HRQL impairment, depending on the type of incontinence, the age, and possibly the gender of the patient.2 Surprisingly, research has not consistently documented a strong relationship between incontinence severity (typically measured in the number of incontinent episodes or grams of fluid lost on a pad test) and HRQL impact. The explanation for the lack of a strong relationship between these two types of patient outcome measures is unclear. In this issue are two reports that examine aspects of the HRQL of community-dwelling older adults with urinary incontinence. The reports approach the topic from different perspectives and research methodologies, yet each report makes an important contribution that furthers our understanding related to the impact of incontinence on one or more domains of quality of life. Catherine DuBeau and her colleagues3 present descriptions of the impact of urge incontinence in the lives of older women and men obtained through qualitative research methodologies. The ultimate goal of their work is to develop a HRQL instrument that has strong validity for use in urge incontinent older patients. These authors compared patient-defined areas of impact obtained through focus group interviews with provider/expert areas of impact obtained from the literature and included in published condition-specific quality of life instruments. DuBeau et al. also examined the patients'descriptions to identify the possible role of patients'explanatory style as a mediator of the impact of incontinence on HRQL. DuBeau et al.'s study represents the second generation of instrument development work in research on the HRQL of incontinent patients. She and her colleagues are to be commended for their sound approach to the development of a new condition-specific HRQL instrument. Because HRQL is, by definition, the patient's own perspectives on his/her functioning and well-being, the use of focus group and content analysis methodologies is appropriate. As a next step in establishing content validity, the authors could either take the items identified in the focus groups back to the participants or take them to a new group of older adults with urge incontinence for further validation. Another critical step, one which is usually skipped in HRQL instrument development, would be to have the participants evaluate the importance of each of the specified items in relation to the other items. This would help identify whether each item should be weighted equally or given a different value in calculating subscale scores. See also p 683 and p 693 One limitation in DuBeau et al.'s study was the use of a nonrepresentative sample, i.e., the sample was all white and predominantly of high socioeconomic status. Cultural and economic differences could affect perceptions of the impact of incontinence in participants'lives. Despite this limitation, the results from this study emphasize the differences between the way experts and patients view HRQL and provide new information on the impact of urge incontinence on older adults. More than half of the items identified by DuBeau and her colleagues were not described previously, which may be related to the different conceptual orientations of researchers about what constitutes HRQL versus what factors influence it. For example, DuBeau and her colleagues include a domain on coping. In some theoretical perspectives, this might be considered a personal trait that is not a characteristic of HRQL, whereas in others it might be viewed as a mediating variable of HRQL.4 Also, specific items identified — such as the inevitability of incontinence, that incontinence is a psychological not a physical problem, the association of incontinence with women's biology, and fear of aging — reflect an individual's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs rather than HRQL. A significant finding in this study was the greater influence of urge incontinence on coping with embarrassment and the interruption of activities compared with the performance of activities, which is used typically in geriatric assessment models. A novel aspect of DuBeau et al.'s study was the examination of explanatory style, i.e., the habitual manner in which persons explain how and why uncontrollable adverse events such as illness occur to them, as a possible mediator of HRQL. Previous research suggests that explanatory style correlates with the range of responses of individuals to illnesses. It makes sense that explanatory style affects responses to incontinence. The authors'findings indicate an association between negative explanatory statements and HRQL items and suggest that there may be gender differences. However, the results on gender differences must be interpreted cautiously because of the small number of men in the sample. No consistent relationship was found between incontinence severity, as measured by the number of incontinent episodes on a voiding diary, and explanatory style. Theodore Johnson II and his colleagues5 conducted a secondary analysis from data collected in the 1990–1991 National Survey of Self Care and Aging to assess whether urinary incontinence and its severity were associated with the self-rating of poor health. The National Survey of Self-Care and Aging is a random sampling of geographic clusters of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the contiguous United States. This study had a sample size of 3485, with oversampling of the oldest-old age group and men to enable subgroup analyses. Findings from Johnson et al.'s study confirm earlier research about the relationship between incontinence and health perceptions. This is an important milestone. Urinary incontinence was associated with poor self-rated health for white subjects who had no instrumental activities of daily living impairments even after controlling for age, activity of daily living status, and comorbid health conditions. The odds of rating one's health poor were doubled if the incontinence was mild to moderate and quadrupled if the incontinence was severe. Previous research examining the relationship between incontinence and self-rated health status has been criticized because of the failure to account adequately for frailty. Johnson et al.'s study did control carefully for functional status and comorbidity and found that urinary incontinence is associated with poor self-rated health independent of frailty. Although analyzed carefully and interpreted cautiously, this study has two main limitations. First, it was a post hoc comparison dependent on cross-sectional data collected in a larger study for a different purpose. Thus, as the authors pointed out, conclusions about causality are problematic. Prospective studies are needed. Second, the quantitative nature of the study, with fixed choice responses to a survey instrument, does not allow for the breadth of responses that might come from in-depth interviews of incontinent individuals, allowing better understanding of why they rated their health as poor. Was it because of the incontinence and its associated symptoms or consequences, or are there other unexplained factors that might have been missed? Future research should address the frame of reference used by incontinent adults in their self-ratings of health. Krause and Jay6 found that global ratings of health are interpreted in different ways by different people and that these ways may depend on race and, possibly, education. Understanding why persons rate health in a particular way may be helpful in determining appropriate interventions. Additional studies on the HRQL of incontinent older adults are greatly needed. There is much that we still need to learn about how age, gender, and lower urinary tract pathophysiology alter the impact of incontinence on HRQL, as well as the factors that influence HRQL. However, these studies should be based on a clear conceptualization of HRQL in which the determinants of quality of life are distinguished from the dimensions of quality of life. Wilson and Cleary7 have presented a useful model that helps categorize clinical variables and shows their relationships with measures of HRQL. In their model, various patient outcomes are linked with causal pathways to show how intervening variables mediate the effect on HRQL. Their model includes five levels of patient outcomes: biological and physiological factors, symptoms, functioning, general health perceptions, and quality of life. Characteristics of the individual (e.g., personality, motivation, values, preferences, and symptom amplification) and of the environment (e.g., psychological, social, and economic supports) influence the five levels in complex ways. In addition, nonmedical factors may directly influence an individual's rating of overall quality of life. Translating their model to incontinence research, the biological and physiological factors might include the underlying pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract, urodynamic variables, and pelvic support and pelvic muscle strength characteristics. Symptoms are the patient's perception of abnormal physical, emotional, or cognitive states and are influenced by demographic and cultural factors. Examples of these include lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Functioning refers to the individual's ability to carry out his/her normal activities. General health perceptions would be the individual's self-rating of health status. Overall quality of life would be the individual's life satisfaction as a whole. In conclusion, the qualitative study by DuBeau and her colleagues and the survey analysis by Johnson and his associates complement each other, enriching our understanding of the way incontinence is interpreted and processed by patients. Further depth and refinement in our understanding of the impact of incontinence can lead to more focused and more effective interventions that will improve the HRQL of the millions of Americans who suffer from incontinence.",

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

      "title": "Genital self‑mutilation: A challenging pathology (Review)",
      "abstract": "Genital self‑mutilation is a pathology that leads to numerous and important discussions, rarely presented in the medical literature. There have been many attempts to explain the reasons behind these medical phenomena, but single cases have been generally reported, making it extremely difficult to draw valid conclusions. It is acknowledged that there are psychotic and non‑psychotic causes, from psychiatric problems and sexual identity disorders to cultural or religious reasons, alcohol or recreational drug consumption, unconventional types of sexual satisfaction or self‑satisfaction. Recent theories consider self‑mutilation as a phenomenon of reducing distress or tension, as an expression of feelings of anger or sorrow. It is believed that 55‑85% of those who have resorted to self‑mutilation have at least once in their life tried to commit suicide. There is evidence that early discovery and intervention as well as proper treatment in regards to psychosis can significantly reduce the number of self‑mutilation episodes, with a protective role of these individuals. Cases of genital self‑mutilation may be considered real medical emergencies, sometimes extremely challenging and accompanied by severe complications. Injury of the genital area is usually accompanied by numerous early or long‑term complications due to the marked vascular area and to the microbial flora present in this part of the body. The degree of mutilation is an unforeseen aspect that the medical staff may have to encounter during the intervention, sometimes testing their imagination and surgical skills when dealing with such a case. Understanding the causes of these self‑aggressive behaviors, which may be life‑threatening, is critical and multidisciplinary mobilization is needed after treatment of the acute phases. The outcome of these patients depends on integrated collaborative work. These cases represent a serious reason for frustration for the physicians involved in solving them, and knowledge of these issues is valuable to urologists, psychiatrists and other health professionals.",

      "abstract": "Humans are social animals attuned to reactions of others; however, some are exquisitely sensitive to--and often misperceive--perceptions of those they encounter. The core feature of social phobia is marked and persistent fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations where the individual worries that others may judge his or her performance as too much or too little. Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance occur when the individual is under scrutiny while speaking or performing publicly, eating with others, writing in public, or using public bathrooms. Diagnosis of social phobia is based largely on history obtained from the patient. Onset is usually around puberty; its course is chronic with comorbid depression common and alcohol and other substances routinely abused in misguided attempts to minimize anxiety and depressive symptoms. At examination, patients often have a moist hand, averted gaze, blushing, and other manifest signs of anxiety. Slight shyness is familiar to most, but a substantial number suffer dysfunctional and distressing social anxiety to the point that they become phobic. A few patients satisfy criteria for avoidant personality disorder, which can be socially incapacitating.",

      "title": "Paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of recovery",
      "abstract": "Bell’s palsy (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the facial nerve) is an acute, usually unilateral paralysis of facial muscles. This disorder had been described and studied by Sir Charles Bell in 1836. In majority of Bell’s palsy cases the patient achieves full spontaneous recovery within 3-5 weeks even without treatment. In about 15-30% of cases the recovery takes considerably longer time (3 to 6 months, sometimes longer) and is usually incomplete. After the incomplete recovery of Bell’s palsy some residuals and complications usually develop. Those can include weakness of facial muscles, facial asymmetry in both neutral expression and with facial movements, pathological synkinesis, contractures of facial muscles, crocodile tears, facial pains etc.\r\n The above-mentioned complications may result in disfigured face with various degrees of severity, involuntary facial movements during speech and emotions, facial pains that are difficult to relieve with pain-killers, inability to adequately express emotions. All the named manifestations can have a dramatic impact on individual’s self-esteem, social contacts and general quality of life. They may lead to stress, depression, self-isolation and in some extreme cases – to suicidal behavior.\r\nCustomary treatment for acute Bell’s palsy include prednisone, antiviral medications, eye care to prevent drying of the cornea, mime-therapy (neuromuscular retraining). Sometimes acupuncture, chiropractors, laser therapy or high doses of B-vitamins are used. In some countries such controversial interventions as electrical stimulation (shocks) and massage with ice-cubes are being used as treatment modalities for acute Bell’s palsy. If the facial condition does not considerably improve within the first year, then the choice of treatments for residuals and complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy is rather limited. It includes continuation of mime-therapy, periodic injections of botulinum toxin, and in some exceptional cases surgical interventions (nerve graft, muscle transposition etc.) Facial nerve decompression has not been proven to be effective as Bell’s palsy treatment and therefore is nowadays seldom used. Long-standing Bell’s palsy patients are left with very limited choice of treatments for their residuals and complications. In the medical world and among rehabilitation specialists it is considered that if Bell’s palsy had not recovered within first 1-2 years and if complications had formed, then the patient will retain the developed synkinesis, contractures, related facial pains and other manifestations for the rest of his or her life.\r\nIn the recent years there has not been much research done of the underlying causes for the complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy. Without thorough understanding of such causes it is rather challenging to compose proper rehabilitation programs that deliver the desired improvements in facial symmetry and respectively, in patient’s quality of life.\r\nIn this article we discuss the traditional approach to possible causes, available treatments of Bell’s palsy complications and share our concept of a new paradigm in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of the recovery (2 years and more). According to this new paradigm, synkinesis, contractures and mass movements of facial muscles, as well as related chronic facial pains are the result of newly-formed, pathological mimetic patterns in the CNS, which can be reduced and then reversed by applying the new approach to rehabilitation, based on other than traditional principles. The results achieved by our patients can serve as an evidence that this new approach may indicate a beginning of a paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy.",

      "title": "Dissociative Identity Disorder and Its Relationship with Other Diagnoses",
      "abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder is the most complex, severe, and chronic condition within the category of dissociative disorders. The core issue in dissociative identity disorder involves significant divisions and discontinuities in an individual's memory, behavior, emotions, consciousness, and identity, which typically function as a cohesive whole. These dissociative experiences lead to impairments in various psychological functions and are often accompanied by other psychological disorders. Compared to other mental health conditions, environmental factors play a more prominent role in the development of dissociative identity disorder. This is primarily because the etiology of dissociative disorders is closely linked to repeated, systematic, and traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood. Historically, dissociative identity disorder has been diagnosed late, and its association with trauma has often been overlooked. The presence of alter identities and the challenges in recognizing dissociative identity disorder have contributed to this oversight, resulting in a delay in exploring the connections between dissociative identity disorder and other diagnoses. This study aims to investigate the history, diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and dissociative aspects of dissociative identity disorder, as well as its relationships with other mental health disorders. Notably, dissociative identity disorder has strong associations with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, somatization, eating disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The interplay between these diagnoses and dissociative identity disorder is examined through the lens of shared symptoms, comorbidity, etiology, and epidemiology. The delayed recognition of the diagnostic and therapeutic protocols for dissociative identity disorder and the consequent neglect of its relationship with other disorders in the literature underscore the significance of this study. By highlighting these connections, we can enhance our understanding and improve the treatment of individuals affected by dissociative identity disorder and its comorbid conditions.",

The merits of the method are not only due to the beneficial effects of the relaxant itself; the anaesthetic, that is invariably administered at the same time, plays an essential part in the procedure. Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

For the late decades, they have been standing out against the background of marginal mental disorders. PTSDs are caused by an individual’s direct involvement in the stress event, fraught with grave consequences and accompanied by mortal fear, horror and sensation of powerlessness. The problem is pressing for the today’sUkrainein view of theDonbaswarfare, mass resettlement, changes of job and forms of activity. The disease may be diagnosed as PTSD in the case the groups of symptoms persist more than a month since a traumatic event has occurred. For a long time, a good many of soldiers have been reported to reveal anxiety-phobic and behavioural disorders, as well as the signs of organic cerebral lesion. Some of them occur during combat operations, whereas the most of symptoms develop and aggravate 1-2 years after coming home. The PTSD patients mostly develop insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased aggressiveness, which cause conflicts. An individual may become wicked, aggressive, discontented and cynical on a social basis. Depressive symptoms are hypothesized to mediate the relationship between PTSD and aggression. The ATO men with PTSD, who do not take alcohol, develop depression 1-1.5 year after coming back and, with alcohol added, the problem of aggression arises. Based on this, we suggest that a staff of personnel, trained in psychological aid to the combatants with PTSD, should be formed. Besides, our cases prove that, with friendly support and compassion as well as active stand in life and adequate social work, aggression and proneness to conflict are unlikely to develop. On the contrary, lack of support results in excessive alcohol consumption and, thereof, increased proneness to conflict. The system of treatment and rehabilitation measures for survives should involve combination of psychotherapy, psychological correction, and medicines.",

Anxiety for one’s health and subjectively experienced bodily sensations force the patient to repeatedly seek medical help, which can aggravate maladjustment and cause significant damage to resources, causing additional stress, closing a vicious circle. Purpose of the study: to analyze the clinical manifestations, problems of diagnosis and treatment of psychopathological disorders using the example of clinical observation of somatoform disorder in a young man with gastroenterological symptoms. Materials and methods: the patient’s diagnosis corresponded to ICD-10 code F45.3 Somatoform dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Clinical-anamnestic, clinical-psychopathological, laboratory and instrumental methods were used. This clinical case demonstrates certain difficulties in diagnosing and treating somatoform disorders due to the need to exclude somatic pathology, nonspecific and difficult to differentiate symptoms that are not subjectively realized by the patient, individual selection of therapy and low compliance with it, and the need for psychotherapeutic assistance.",

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms causing great personal distress and impairing social and occupational function. The societal burden from anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms of all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis on identification of the specific features of particular disorders. Need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, level of associated disability, impact on everyday life, presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatments. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics and patient and doctor preferences. There is much overlap between different anxiety disorders in evidence-based and effective therapies (e.g. prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or course of cognitive behavioural therapy), but there are important differences. It thus helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

Shosha is characterized mainly with Vyavaya, Shoka, Jara, Vyayama, Vrana, Adhwa, Upawasa and Urah-kshata , considering its features. It is found mainly primary and secondary. Secondary Shosha is a result of some other disease causing general emaciation of body. It is not necessary to label the Kshaya of all Dhatus as Shosha.

Compathy occurs when one person observes another person suffering a disease or injury and experiences in one's physical body a similar or related distress. Thus, compathy is the physical equivalent to empathy. Although the contagion of physiological (compathetic) responses has been previously documented (for example, as couvades or psychogenic epidemics of the workplace), it has not been theoretically explicated. Triggers for the compathetic response are identified and include observing the suffering, hearing, or reading—or even thinking about—descriptions of the symptoms. The relevance of the compathetic response in the caregiving relationship and the necessity of suppressing the response when inflicting pain as a part of providing therapy are described.

In addition to physical discomfort, pressure injuries can lead to psychological and social problems hurting patients' quality of life and are further associated with greater health costs; management of pressure injuries is therefore recognized as an important indicator of the quality of care in health care facilities. However, studies have shown that the progress of skin changes in terminal patients and patients receiving palliative care tends to be more rapid than that of pressure injuries, which usually needs to go through redness and blistering before evolving into a wound covered by eschar. In this article, we reviewed recent studies regarding prevention of pressure injuries and management of pressure injuries in patients receiving palliative care. Also performed was a literature review of terminal skin injuries, including Kennedy terminal ulcer and 3:30 syndrome, skin changes at life's end, Trombley-Brennan terminal tissue injuries, and skin failure. Skin failure in terminal patients needs to be distinguished from pressure injury. The validity of the ＂Skin Failure Clinical Indicator Scale＂ merits further investigations before the scale can be expected to be widely applied in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews studies that have examined associations between unusual sleep experiences (including nightmares, vivid dreaming, narcolepsy symptoms, and complex nighttime behaviors) and dissociation and schizotypy. Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

However, a narrow medicalized view of suffering, solely defined as physical discomfort, ignores or minimizes the broader significance of the suffering experienced by debilitated chronically ill adults. A fundamental form of that suffering is the loss of self in chronically ill persons who observe their former self-images crumbling away without the simultaneous development of equally valued new ones. As a result of their illnesses, these individuals suffer from (1) leading restricted lives, (2) experiencing social isolation, (3) being discredited and (4) burdening others. Each of these four scores of suffering is analysed in relation to its effects on the consciousness of the ill person. The data are drawn from a qualitative study of 57 chronically ill persons with varied diagnoses.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

It includes both the sensory input and any modulation by physiological, psychological and environmental factors. Not surprisingly there are no objective measures – there is no way to measure pain directly by sampling blood or urine or by performing neurophysiological tests. Measurement of pain must therefore rely on recording the patient’s report. The assumption is often made that because the measurement is subjective it must be of little value. The reality is that if the measurements are done properly, remarkably sensitive and consistent results can be obtained. There are contexts, however, when it is not possible to measure pain at all, or when reports are likely to be unreliable. These include impaired consciousness, young children, psychiatric pathology, severe anxiety, unwillingness to co-operate, and inability to understand the measurements. Such problems are deliberately avoided in trials.",

Se define el estrés y se clasifica desde diferentes perspectivas. El estrés es una causa de tensión y exigencia o mecanismo de adaptación.El estrés y la presentación del primer episodio depresivo están directamente relacionados, sin embargo cuando se presentan recurrencias el estrés significativo pierde fuerza dentro de los factores que lo desencadenan. Los estresores, especialmente los psicosociales, están relacionados con la presentación de recurrencias. Entre estos se destacan estresores internos y externos, por sucesos vitales, estrés de rol y las contrariedades cotidianas, la alta exigencia y el perfeccionismo. El no cumplimiento de metas es otro factor provocador de crisis en la transición del ciclo vital. El neuroticismo y el perfeccionismo, como actitudes disfuncionales provocan aislamiento y falta de soporte social. Los esquemas cognitivos disfuncionales conducen a un procesamiento erróneo de la información. La depresión es una pauta de relación que no permite encontrar formas adaptativas de enfrentar la vida y conducir las relaciones interpersonales. Aunque hay nuevas visiones que la consideran como un esfuerzo adaptativo. La comorbilidad puede hacer recurrir la depresión. Se ha sugerido que patrones maladaptativos cognitivos, en particular en interacción con estresores, podrían llevar a pobres resultados en el tratamiento de sujetos con trastorno depresivo mayor en comorbilidad con trastornos de personalidad.

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

The event is then persistently re-experienced. The person avoids stimuli associated with the trauma and experiences a numbing of general responsiveness. Symptoms of increased arousal can occur as well as depression and anxiety. PTSD causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The general practitioner is uniquely placed to identify PTSD and can have a key role in treatment. Cognitive behavioural treatment is a central therapeutic approach and can be carried out in general practice. The issues are to counteract the physiological components, expose the patient to the feared situation and help the patient to relearn that the stimuli are not necessarily associated with danger or threat. Repeated brief consultations over time can facilitate this process.",

But, as clinical evidence shows, the symptoms of either overaction or underaction are for the most part the same, no matter what the cause. It is hence convenient to group all of these anomalies in one category, without attempting to distinguish them into structural, insertional and innervational, and to use the terms paralysis and spasm to denote them, no matter what their origin.

The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders in the general population. There is a strong bidirectional association between anxiety and related disorders and co-occurring general medical conditions. The co-occurrence of anxiety and related disorders and general medical conditions is associated with significant impairment, morbidity and economic costs. At the same time, recognition of anxiety and related disorders in people with medical illness may be challenging when comorbid with physical illness due in part to overlap in symptomatology. Furthermore, there is a relatively limited evidence base of randomized controlled trials in this population. Additional work is needed to improve screening for anxiety and related disorders in medical illness, to enhance diagnosis and assessment, and to optimize treatment.",

      "title": "Depresija kao javnozdravstveni problem",
      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

      "abstract": "Summary Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness due to damage of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD is about 2.5% of the population. The rates in men and women are equal. The mean age of onset is in the mid-to-late twenties to early thirties, and it is slightly earlier in males´ population. OCD has two fundamental phenomenological characteristics: repetitive urges of thoughts or actions which patients experience as coming from their own mind but as alien to their will; and surges of unbearable anxiety which accompany either resistance to these compulsions or exposure to objects or thoughts which trigger the repetitive behaviour or cognitions. The cultural influence on the content of the obsessions has been noted in the epidemiological studies. The familial nature of OCD has been observed since several years and recent studies have provided limited evidence for the importance of genetic factors in the manifestation of obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Recent studies suggest gender-related clinical differences in the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The most prevalent obsession is concerned with contamination by dirt and/or germs. Washing is the accompanying compulsion and such patients may spend several hours daily washing their hands or cleaning their clothes. There are two main approaches to the treatment of OCD: psychological treatment and pharmacological treatment. Antidepressants afford a successful treatments for OCD but only those with potent effects on the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems appear to have antiobsessional efficacy.",

The existence and characteristics of such putative predisposing personality patterns has been the subject of considerable discussion in psychiatric and psychoanalytic literature, the reliability of which, when subjected to critical review, is compromised seriously by method ological and other inadequacies. For instance, the association of obsessive personality and involutional depression rests on tenuous grounds. There is enough evidence for depressogenic potential of the socalled oral or dependent personality as described by psychoanalysts, especially in the case of major (manic-depressive) illnesses, to warrant further investigation.",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

A similar procedure should occur in the psychiatric evaluation of, say, a patient with depression, first looking for secondary causes, such as Cushing's syndrome, before considering a diagnosis of one of the idiopathic causes, shch as major depressive disorder.

Some characteristics of the history of trauma have their origin in this situation. One of them is the gradual extension for instance of the notion of 'trauma' which makes the surgical 'wound' (greek: trauma) evolve into a bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Other characteristics of the history of trauma are its association with questions of endogenous versus exogenous causes of suffering and with the issue of guilt and its recurrent falling into oblivion. The paper traces the history of traumatogenic illness from the simple wound to forensically important damages like the 'railway-injuries' entitling to claims for damages, to 'traumatic-' and 'war-neuroses' and finally to the more or less endemic 'posttraumatic stress syndrome' of present time.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue can refer to a subjective symptom of malaise and aversion to activity or to objectively impaired performance. It has both physical and mental aspects. The symptom of fatigue is a poorly defined feeling, and careful inquiry is needed to clarify complaints of “fatigue,” “tiredness,” or “exhaustion” and to distinguish lack of energy from loss of motivation or sleepiness, which may be pointers to specific diagnoses (see below). \r\n\r\nPrevalence—Like blood pressure, subjective fatigue is normally distributed in the population. The prevalence of clinically significant fatigue depends on the threshold chosen for severity (usually defined in terms of associated disability) and persistence. Surveys report that 5-20% of the general population suffer from such persistent and troublesome fatigue. Fatigue is twice as common in women as in men but is not strongly associated with age or occupation. It is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in primary care, being the main complaint of 5-10% of patients and an important subsidiary symptom in a further 5-10%.\r\n\r\nFatigue as a symptom—Patients generally regard fatigue as important (because it is disabling), whereas doctors do not (because it is diagnostically non-specific). This discrepancy is a potent source of potential difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. Fatigue may present in association with established medical and psychiatric conditions or be idiopathic. Irrespective of cause, it has a major impact on day to day functioning and quality of life. Without treatment, the prognosis of patients with idiopathic fatigue is surprisingly poor; half those seen in general practice with fatigue are still fatigued six months later.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "title": "Relationship between stress and pain in work‐related upper extremity disorders: The hidden role of chronic multisymptom illnesses*",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Pain and fatigue are commonly associated with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Occasionally these symptoms persist beyond a reasonable healing period. One potential explanation for prolonged symptom expression is the concurrent development of a stress‐mediated illness or CMI (Chronic Multi‐Symptom Illness). In such a scenario, the chronic regional pain and other symptoms that the individual is experiencing would be attributable to the CMI rather than to tissue damage or a biomechanical dysfunction of the upper‐extremity. Methods This article critically reviews the case definitions of the new class of CMI disorders and evaluates the existing evidence supporting centrally mediated physiological changes (e.g., sensory hypervigilance, dysautonomia) that manifest as symptoms of pain and fatigue in some individuals experiencing chronic stressors. Results While explanations for prolonged pain and fatigue have historically focused on mechanisms involving peripheral pathology or psychiatric explanations, ample evidences support the role of altered Central Nervous System function in accounting for symptom manifestation in CMI. Conclusions A model is presented that unites seemingly disparate findings across numerous investigations and provides a framework for understanding how genetics, triggering events, stressors, and early life events can affect CNS activity. Resultant symptom expression (e.g., pain and fatigue) from central dysregulation would be expected to occur in a subset of individuals in the population, including a subset of individuals with work‐related upper extremity disorders. Thus when symptoms such as pain and fatigue persist beyond a reasonable period, consideration of CMI and associated assessment and interventions focused on central mechanisms may be worthwhile. Am.

      "abstract": "Bruxism is a controversial phenomenon. Both its definition and the diagnostic procedure contribute to the fact that the literature about the aetiology of this disorder is difficult to interpret. There is, however, consensus about the multifactorial nature of the aetiology. Besides peripheral (morphological) factors, central (pathophysiological and psychological) factors can be distinguished. In the past, morphological factors, like occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region, have been considered the main causative factors for bruxism. Nowadays, these factors play only a small role, if any. Recent focus is more on the pathophysiological factors. For example, bruxism has been suggested to be part of a sleep arousal response. In addition, bruxism appears to be modulated by various neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. More specifically, disturbances in the central dopaminergic system have been linked to bruxism. Further, factors like smoking, alcohol, drugs, diseases and trauma may be involved in the bruxism aetiology. Psychological factors like stress and personality are frequently mentioned in relation to bruxism as well. However, research to these factors comes to equivocal results and needs further attention. Taken all evidence together, bruxism appears to be mainly regulated centrally, not peripherally.",

      "abstract": "Negative symptoms are considered a core feature of schizophrenia. They are present since the prodromal phase and tend to persist more than other psychopathological dimensions in the chronic stages. The domain of apathy has attracted research efforts for the strong association with poor functional outcome. This negative symptom domain is observed in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders and might have both overlapping and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. In schizophrenia it can be secondary to other aspects of the disorder, such as positive symptoms and depression, to drug side effects and/or social isolation, often observed in affected subjects. When primary to schizophrenia, apathy is conceptualized in terms of a reduction of the voluntary activity due to a lack of interest and motivation for goal-directed behavior initiation and persistence. In a percentage of subjects, apathy tend to persist and do not respond to available pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. The assessment of this domain in patients with schizophrenia using internationally recognized criteria for its definition, as were recently developed in other neuropsychiatric disorders, might help disentangle the different pathophysiological mechanisms. In the presentation, studies of apathy in schizophrenia will be illustrated to highlight the relationships with cognitive dysfunction, other psychopathological dimensions and functional outcome using state of the art instruments to assess the construct in schizophrenia.

The relationship between headache and SLE is also unclear since it is difficult to determine which degree and type of headaches can be explained on the basis of chronic illness, or as part of the disease spectrum of SLE. No pathogenic mechanism has so far been described that can fully explain headache induced by SLE. The role of circulating cytokines, vascular injury, neuronal damage or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the development of headache in SLE patients is also a matter of debate. Other concomitant causes such as infection or hypertension should be excluded before assuming that headache is a feature of SLE activity.

The mechanisms linking depression and distress with illness include habitual lifestyle factors such as physical inactivity and smoking, poor treatment adherence, and biological processes including systemic inflammation, adrenocortical and autonomic dysregulation.

As the illness progresses, personality changes can happen, as well as affect abnormalities. Cognitive changes occur frequently in MS patients, and affect features like processing speed, attention, learning, memory, visual spatial capabilities, and some language deficits. Disease-modifying treatments may reduce cognitive impairment because of their container action on the brain's lesion burden. Other QoL determinants such as fatigue, pain, sexual dysfunction, exercise, resilience and social support should be taken into account, in order to promote the individuals' well-being. Further studies are needed in order to elucidate the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and more neuroimaging studies are required to clarify the relationship between structural changes and psychiatric comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other healthcare providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This Primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and man-age the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, light-headedness and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1%-0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, orthostatic intolerance and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.",

In fact, it is the most frequent diagnosis utilized for psychiatric disorders in the military and in children, and is often utilized in the consultation-liaison medical setting. However, it is acknowledged that the diagnosis is not reliable, it cannot be validated, and it has an important degree of subjective consideration in its use. Commonly used screening tools like the Hamilton and Beck Depression Scales do not give an assessment of AD. Furthermore, its use is accompanied with descriptors of depression, anxiety, mixed affects, etc., so that it crosses over several areas of psychiatric dysfunction. It does allow the placement of a patient within a psychiatric diagnosis when they do not reach criteria for a major psychiatric nomenclature. To date, biological studies have not been reported. It is not known if AD with depression is closer to the biological characteristics of depression, or AD with anxiety would have similar characteristics to that seen with major anxiety. It is also not known if AD has a biological signature that would make them an entity with common features, or if they may be more closely allied biologically with the descriptor that accompanies them. Nevertheless, AD is an important category in any psychiatric lexicon and warrants further study and biological understanding.",

It is not the etiology of back pain that has changed in the last 20 years, but its rate of assessment and treatment options. According to the relevant literature, treatment of chronic back pain will most probably only succeed using multimodal concepts that have to consider medical/somatic and psychosocial aspects and be based on scientific training experience. Pain assessment is based on common legal and certification standards. However, typical decision and rating problems result from the difficulty of objective medical registration and grading of pain. Medical certification may often be complicated by co-morbidities such as somatic pain attacks, fibromyalgia, depression or anxiety.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders in children and adolescents",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Dissociative or conversion disorders (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision [ICD-10]; hereafter referred to as dissociative disorders) are characterized by disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, sensations, and control of body movements. The symptoms of this disorder are not due to substance use and are not limited to pain or sexual symptoms, and the gain is primarily psychological and not monetary or legal. In these disorders, it is presumed that the ability to exercise a conscious and selective control over the symptoms is impaired, to a degree that can vary from day to day or even from hour to hour. However, it must be added that it is usually very difficult to assess the extent to which some of the loss of function might be under voluntary control. The diagnosis is made by the presence of specific clinical features, no evidence of a physical disorder that might explain the symptoms, and evidence for psychological causation in the form of clear association in time with stressful life events and problems or disturbed interpersonal relationships. Dissociative disorder can be of different types, as shown in Table 1.Table 1: International Classification of Disease-10 category of dissociative 10 categories of dissociative (conversion) disordersThese guidelines are an update to previous IPS guidelines on dissociative disorders (2008) in child or adolescent (hereafter child unless specified). These are broad guidelines which will help in systematic assessment and management of a child with dissociative disorder. ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS The assessment of dissociative disorders involves a detailed psychiatric and developmental history. An assessment should be made of the child's temperament, schooling, and peer relationships. The family functioning should be explored. A comprehensive medical, neurological, and mental status examination should be done. An assessment of psychosocial circumstances and problems should be done, especially to find which ones are temporally associated with the onset of dissociative symptoms. One should obtain psychiatric history from all the possible sources including the teachers, if possible. Furthermore, assessment should be made of the perception of the child and parents about the dissociative symptoms. An attempt should be made regarding the presence of physical and psychological symptoms in the other family members or the neighbors which may act as a model. The key points in the assessment of pediatric dissociative disorders are shown in Table 2.Table 2: Key points in the assessmentRULING-OUT PHYSICAL AND OTHER PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS As mentioned above, an initial comprehensive medical and neurological assessment is crucial in any child where a possibility of a dissociative disorder is being kept. In this regard, the treating psychiatrist should always consider seeking appropriate consultations. Relevant physical and psychological investigations must be done [Table 3]. An assessment of educational achievement of the child with regard to the child's potential and the level of education provided should be done, which is often indicated. The possibility of dissociative symptoms superimposed on neurological or medical disorders or other psychiatric disorders should always be carefully considered.Table 3: Investigations for ruling out physical or psychiatric disordersIf dissociative symptoms appear for the first time in a preschool child, a strong suspicion of an underlying physical or psychiatric disorder should be kept in mind because dissociative disorders are very rare in this age group. DIAGNOSIS OF DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER SHOULD NOT BE MERELY BASED ON THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIVE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL DISORDER Although it is very important to exclude an underlying or associated physical disorder, as well as other primary psychiatric disorders that may explain the dissociative symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative disorder should not be based merely on the absence of objective signs of a physical or psychiatric disorder. It is imperative to remember that the absence of physical findings applies universally to an earliest stage in the development of all diseases. Moreover, physical findings that appear nonrelevant at first may assume significance later. The diagnosis of dissociative disorder is not just of exclusion. The clinician should always keep in mind the overall biopsychosocial context of the child and the symptoms. When the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder is made with too much certainty without proper assessment, other physical or psychiatric disorders are often missed. When the diagnosis is too tentative, multiple and irrational medical evaluations may be conducted, and iatrogenic reinforcement of the symptoms and harm is possible. Pseudoseizures or nonepileptic seizures are a common presentation of dissociative disorders in children which must be differentiated from true epileptic seizures [Table 4].Table 4: Differences between dissociative convulsion and epileptic seizurePSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS OR STRESSORS Psychological distress overt or covert is an essential causative factor for dissociative disorders. A list of common stressors in pediatric dissociation is shown in Table 5. Stressors are not mutually exclusive.Table 5: Psychosocial factorsAttempts should be made to systematically identify the child's psychosocial environment, stressors, and coping abilities to handle stressful life situations. An attempt should also be made to find the secondary gains due to dissociative disorder. A view that stressors are \"unconscious\" creates a barrier in the physician's mind about looking for stressors. Studies in children with dissociative disorders have shown that stressors are generally present in day-to-day life of the patients and are known both to the patient and the family members. However, they may not reveal them for certain reasons. It is important for the clinician to evaluate the child for the stressors from a developmental perspective. It may not be possible to find stressor in the initial interviews. By repeated, careful and sensitive interviewing stressors can be elicited. Stressors in children and adolescents may include day-to-day problems such as difficulty in school or in family relationships, fights with other children, scolding and punishment by the teachers or family members, some frightening experiences, and educational difficulties. The child may find oneself in some kind of unwanted or disliked situation such as marriage, job or studies, bullying, and sometimes abuse and neglect. The stressor could also be an unaddressed physical illness or deformity. Assessing in detail about the onset of symptoms may give clue to the possible stressor, for example, becoming unconscious at school in English period. At times, stressors may not be severe enough to be noticed by the family members of the patient. Moreover, the family members may not be able to correlate the stressor with the onset of dissociative symptoms. In such cases, stressors should be assessed systematically, and the severity and temporal correlation of stressors with the onset of symptoms should be clearly delineated. One may use multiaxial ICD-10 Axis V for systematic assessment of stressors in children. The ICD-10 specifies that there should be convincing associations in time between the onset of symptoms of the disorder and \"stressful (life) events, problems, or needs.\" However, Indian studies point out that stressors are found in only 62%–82% of cases of dissociative disorder. Unless all the diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of dissociative disorder including temporally related psychosocial stressors are met, a confident diagnosis should not be made. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES Dissociative symptoms could be the presenting symptoms of underlying undetected psychiatric disorders such as separation anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, school phobia, depression, and at times, impending psychosis. Then, dissociative disorder may also have comorbid oppositional defiant disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability, especially in boys. Therefore, it is important to screen for all age-appropriate psychiatric disorders in the child to avoid missing an underlying primary or a comorbid diagnosis. Dissociative disorders should be differentiated from factitious disorder and malingering. In latter two situations, the symptoms are intentionally produced to a assume sick role. The gain is psychological in factitious disorder. In factitious disorder by proxy, the parent (s) induce illness in the child for their own psychological gains. In malingering, the symptoms are feigned to obtain an incentive like money or some other material gain or to avoid a disliked responsibility or punishment. Apparent fabrication of symptoms or gross inconsistencies in history should raise possibility of malingering or factitious disorder. FALSE-POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Rates of misdiagnosis are around 4%. False-positive diagnosis is likely if importance is given only to the symptoms and not to the underlying physical or psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial circumstances. One must assess the case with open mind. One should review the past medical records carefully, and if required, further assessments should be done. Some of the diagnostic difficulties are mentioned in Table 6.Table 6: Physical differential diagnosisIt is also likely that these false-positive diagnoses are made more often in females, psychiatrically disordered children, patients presenting plausible psychogenic explanations for their illnesses, and patients with unusual movement disorders or epilepsy. POSITIVE SIGNS Various \"positive signs\" of dissociative disorders have been described in the literature such as tunnel vision, discrete anesthetic patches, astasia-abasia, positive Hoover's test, preserved cough in hysterical aphonia, and hemianesthesia sharply separated at the midline. These signs indicate normally preserved physiological functions underlying the superficial appearance of incapacity. In addition to the above \"positive signs,\" hysterofrenic areas (areas on body, which when pressed, abort the hysterical episode, usually convulsive in nature) and hysterogenic areas (areas on body, e.g., a hyperesthetic spot, which when pressed can induce a hysterical episode) have also been mentioned. It must be kept in mind that dissociative disorders can be easily misdiagnosed or overdiagnosed if these \"positive signs\" are taken to be pathognomonic of the disorder. Studies indicate that these positive signs can also be seen in neurological patients. Gould et al. looked for the positive signs of hysteria in 30 consecutive neurological admissions (25 of which had acute strokes in adults). These \"signs\" were la belle indifference, nonanatomic sensory loss, midline split of pain or vibratory sensations, changing boundaries for hypoalgesia, giveaway weakness, and history of hypochondriasis. All 30 patients showed at least one out of seven \"signs,\" most exhibited more than one \"signs,\" and one patient had all seven \"signs.\" TREATMENT It is imperative to treat dissociative disorders promptly to prevent habituation and future disability. The longer the symptoms remain, the more aggressive the treatment should be. The treatment usually consists of two parts: (a) early treatment directed toward symptom removal and (b) long-term treatment directed toward the resolution of stressors and prevention of further episodes. Dissociative disorders are seen very less internationally. Therefore, there are no practice guidelines for the management of dissociative disorders. The proposed treatment guidelines are based mainly on Indian work in this area. Table 7 gives the key points of treatment.Table 7: TreatmentPRINCIPLES OF ACUTE MANAGEMENT Rapport and therapeutic alliance The cornerstone of successful therapy is establishment of therapeutic rapport and alliance with the child. It is also very important to have good doctor–parent relationship because the parents have to become an ally in treatment of the child. Parental influences on the child are significant even in the hospital setup. Unless the parents understand the clinician's point of view, it may not be possible to alter their overprotective and overindulgent attitude and behavior toward the child. One should listen to the concerns of the family carefully and try to understand their perception of the child's symptoms. PSYCHOSOCIAL EXPLANATION OF DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMS First of all, the diagnostic assessment must be done in an impressive manner, and the parents should be involved in the assessment process. It would be useful to explain to them why a particular assessment is being done and what the results are expected to show. When the results of this diagnostic assessment are obtained, their significance should also be explained to the parents. After reliably ruling out physical or other psychiatric illness as the cause of dissociative symptoms, the child and the family should be strongly assured that there is nothing physically seriously wrong with the child and the symptoms are psychogenic and that the child will make a complete recovery [Table 8]. When physical or psychiatric disorders are ruled out and the possibility of the dissociative symptoms being psychogenic is put forward, it is usually very vehemently rejected by the parents. That there could be anything psychologically wrong with their \"severely ill\" child, their parenting or with their family functioning, is totally unacceptable to the parents. Any suggestion of this possibility is met with resentment, anger, and sometimes open hostility. Therefore, any confrontation about the nature of the symptoms should be avoided at all costs, and all the members of the treating team should adopt the same nonconfrontational, calm approach toward the disorder the child and family. When the treatment team's point of view is understood and accepted by the family, only then it would be possible for them to cooperate in psychosocial assessments.Table 8: Key points in psychoeducationADDRESSING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS Once the causes are known, then attempts should be made to solve the \"problem.\" The problem should be discussed with the child and the family. In case of adolescents, if the problem has been revealed to doctor or the ward staff in confidence, then consent of the adolescent should be taken to discuss it with the family. The physician should not force his opinion on the child or the family. Problems of family relationships should be discussed, and family should be told that the child is being adversely affected by the family problems and their resolution will improve the child. At times, family therapy may be required. It is also important to open up the channels of communication between the child and his family. Throughout the treatment, attention should be focused on the child and his functioning rather than on the symptoms. This helps in speedy recovery. In most of the patients, reassurance and suggestions of recovery coupled with attention to the patient's psychosocial needs lead to a rapid recovery [Table 9].Table 9: Behavioral management of childrenSYMPTOM SUBSTITUTION As the dissociative symptoms begin to subside, the child may sometimes manifest other new dissociative symptoms in their place. Occasionally, distress may be expressed by deliberate self-harm, demanding, and histrionic behavior or the child may develop depressive symptoms. In such a situation, consistent limit setting may be essential for continuation of psychological treatment. Regularity of follow-up visits is important so that the patient does not need to \"produce\" a symptom to visit the therapist. Finally, the physician should not feel pressurized to cure the child very quickly. He should retain his calm and be prepared to face the hostility and aggression of the family and coercion for not using medication and quickly improving the child. SECONDARY GAINS Reduction in secondary gains is not advisable very early in the treatment and without adequate explanations to the family because of three reasons.First, the physician himself may not be certain about the origin of the symptoms. Second, the family may perceive reduction in secondary gain as neglect of the child. Furthermore, initially, the family may not have full confidence in the physician and the hospital's ability to take total care of their child. Later on, the family should be offered adequate explanations regarding secondary gains. Reduction in secondary gains in a child should be coupled with an alternative, healthy, socially acceptable, and age-appropriate role or activities for the child in which he or she can be trained and rewarded for doing something positive. ABREACTION AND AVERSION THERAPY Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior has often been employed in resistant cases, for example, using liquor ammonia, aversive faradic stimulation, pressure over trochlear notch, tragus of ear or over the sternum, and closing the nose and mouth. Aversion therapy for unwanted behavior is not advised as it may harm the patient and has a pejorative connotation equivalent to punishment. It may provide only temporary benefits, if any. Abreaction is bringing to conscious awareness, thoughts, affects, and memories for the first time, with or without the use of drugs. This may be achieved by hypnosis, free association, or drugs. Abreaction may further foster dissociative states. Moreover, some patients treated with this technique may perceive the therapist as sanctioning the dissociative states; hence, it is not recommended. MEDICATION Medication may be used only for concomitant anxiety, depression, or behavioral problems and not for the dissociative symptoms. The family should be tactfully made to understand that medications are neither required nor approved for dissociative symptoms. Otherwise, the family may perceive that doctor is unable to diagnose the child's problem and treat it. The use of medication will unnecessary expose the child to the side effects. In addition, the family may not give enough attention to psychological treatment thinking that medication will cure the dissociative symptoms. However, at times, there are families who persistently demand medication despite repeated explanations. In such situations, one may consider using a placebo to retain the child in treatment and overcome resentment or hostility of the family. NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION Hospitalization is required when there is doubt in the diagnosis, severe symptoms are present, the family is very distressed, or the symptoms are recalcitrant and resistant to outpatient treatment. DUAL DIAGNOSIS If the dissociative symptoms are present with the physical disorder, then the physical disorder should be treated first. When the physical disorder is stabilized, then the dissociative symptoms if still present should be managed as per the guidelines. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER Chronic cases are more difficult to treat, and the management should always begin with a rational comprehensive evaluation and clear explanation to the child and the family about the findings. Psychoeducation of the family about the nature of the disorder and its course and outcome is necessary. Similar things should also be explained to the child taking into account his ability to understand and accept the information. The family should be explained that although the symptoms are real and impairing, a serious physical disorder is not causing them and there is hope of full recovery. Psychotherapy may be useful but contraindicated in a patient who is resistant to it or gets worse when it is initiated. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY Family-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps the affected child to become aware of, examine, and if appropriate revise the way they think, respond, and behave rationally to their symptoms. The aim of CBT is to maximize functioning and reduce the dissociative symptoms. Gradually, onus of treatment should be shifted from the physician to the child and the family. The following are the principles of CBT in chronic dissociative states: Give positive explanations for symptoms Persuade the child that change is possible, he or she is not \"damaged,\" and they do have the potential to recover Discuss the treatment rationale with the patient and the key family members Encourage engagement in daily routine activities Teach relaxation and distraction away from unpleasant thoughts and the symptoms Encourage the patient to rationally reconsider unhelpful and negative thoughts Negotiate a phased return to work and studies Joint activities with family in symptom-free periods. Evidence exists at systematic review level that CBT is effective for a wide range of functional somatic symptoms. Its use has also been described (although not properly tested) in patients with nonepileptic attacks, dissociative motor symptoms, and severe and multiple functional symptoms.

      "title": "Pathological Mourning: A Key Factor in the Psychopathogenesis of Autoimmune Disorders",
      "abstract": "Prolonged mourning has been recorded as a precipitant life event in RA and other autoimmune disorders, but other events such as retirement, redundancy and injury have also been identified. The author's submission is that pathological mourning is present in all patients with AI disease, and that other events such as those mentioned are only precipitant because they uncover mourning until then kept in check by occupation and use of work as a drug. When time for reflection and loneliness allows long suppressed ambivalent feelings, guilt and bitterness to surface, remorse over 'unfinished business' increasingly dominates the patient's thoughts. Children and young people rarely have the opportunity to mourn, thus early loss is often paramount and is awakened from the unconscious years later when further losses of key figures or surrogates, including pets, occur or are anticipated. Psychotherapy involves helping patients resolve their pathological mourning.",

      "abstract": "The majority of patients meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder deliberately harm themselves at some time in their lives.This deliberate self-harm is nearly always subsequent to interpersonal loss.This paper postulates that the physiological arousal, which precedes deliberate self-harm, has a distinctive pattern specific to borderline personality disorder.The clinical manifestations are: baseline distress, followed by an environmental trigger factor (separation), which sets off an acute response of increasing distress, usually accompanied by ruminations.This develops into an intensely disagreeable subjective state, with simultaneous cutaneous anaesthesia or dissociative symptoms.It is this highly unpleasant state which is rapidly and very effectively relieved by soft tissue injury.In borderline personality disorder a dysfunctional stress response is hypothesised to underlie the acute subjective distress and the accompanying somatic symptoms that occur prior to deliberate self-harm.Central neuro-humoral mechanisms, via peripheral afferent stimulation as a result of soft tissue injury, are hypothesised to relieve the subjective tension by re-establishing homoeostasis.This paper examines the underlying biological aspects of separation distress and the mechanism by which it is relieved.In this sense separation distress is conceptualised in behavioural terms as the reaction to an environmental event.The psychological mechanisms of attachment and separation are not examined.Deliberate self-harm in borderline personality disorder may thus be understood as a coping mechanism, a potent means of overcoming unbearable subjective distress.A clearer understanding of the mechanisms of this behaviour may lead to more effective and compassionate treatments.",

Their proximity is an indicator of the closeness of the classification of the two disorders. Dissociation is often part of the response to trauma. Transient symptoms of depersonalization or derealization lasting a few moments to a few hours are commonly experienced by most people at some point in their lives. The DSM-5 criteria for dissociative identity disorder requires the presence of two or more distinct personality states that is observed or self-reported and that results in disruption or discontinuity in the sense of self, and is accompanied by changes in affect, behavior, cognition, perception, consciousness, memory, or sensory-motor functioning. Dissociative amnesia involves the inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, and often follows a traumatic or stressful life event.",

Curiously enough, compared with other functional symptomatology, somehow this disturbance has been neglected in literature until now. Urologists, surgeons, and internists have more difficulties than psychiatrists to find out that distinct emotional conflicts and especially unsatisfactory sexual adjustment might have contributed to the development of recurrent or chronic urinary retention which they vainly tried to explain by organic findings. Of course the fact that extensive medical evaluations or even surgical procedures revealed no abnormality except the stout urinary bladder never is suifficient to qualify for \"hysterical disease\". Every diagnosis has to be established on positive grounds. Hypothetic explanations of mysterious syndromes by supposing more \"microscopic\" and thus undetected morphological deficiencies and changes as the crucial cause of a disease never should become the protective trick by which a physician avoids confrontation with his patients' psychological problems.",

While its day-to-day benefits have been explored for some time, its clinical implications have been understudied, and for the most part have been limited to potential detrimental effects on mood. We propose that spontaneous thought has a wider variety of clinical effects, as well as a number of potential therapeutic benefits—affording the opportunity to address suppressed or repressed material, facilitating therapeutic insights, and promoting general relaxation. Its unconstrained mode may not be without clinical risks, however. Within literature discussing meditation, sleep, relaxation, and sensory deprivation—activities that promote unconstrained attention—evidence suggests that some individuals may become destabilized, or face a worsening of symptoms in some circumstances. More research needs to be done to clarify the mediating factors that could result in these divergent outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and, in type one, cataplexy, often accompanied by disrupted nocturnal sleep, parasomnias, and other impairments. This study aims to explore patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences of these symptoms. Methods A qualitative study was conducted using narrative semi-structured interviews with 25 narcolepsy patients, guided by a structure approved by a multidisciplinary expert board. The interviews, conducted at the patients’ homes or hospitals, were transcribed, inductively analyzed to develop a codebook, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The onset and manifestation were key themes for each symptom. EDS was often described as “microsleeps” or “shutting off,” causing embarrassment when occurring publicly and influenced by factors such as the weather, seasons, or menstruation. Cataplexy was commonly triggered by positive emotions or situations, including sexual intercourse, with patients often suppressing emotions to prevent episodes, leading to misinterpretations by others as drunkenness. Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including vivid dreams, nightmares, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations, led to negative emotional experiences. Overall, narcolepsy symptoms significantly impacted patients’ emotional well-being. Conclusion The burden of narcolepsy is deeply tied to patients’ perceptions and emotional experiences, significantly affecting their quality of life, yet few studies have used qualitative approaches to explore their perspectives.",

These problems are not specific to psychiatry but they are more obvious and more complex than many of those met elsewhere in medicine, largely because the most characteristic symptoms are subjective; known only because a person describes them. Observable signs do exist, such as autonomic arousal in someone describing a subjective feeling of anxiety, or evidence of concomitant activity in the cortex while describing auditory hallucinations. But the reported experience is often the only evidence available. The first and most basic problem, therefore, is to decide whether a symptom is present or absent. The second problem, an extension of the first, is to assess clinical severity.",

      "abstract": "Syncope in the aviation environment can be a very difficult problem to assess. Even more difficult is the differential diagnosis between convulsive syncope and epilepsy after the first event. This paper discusses syncope in general and the differential diagnosis between vasovagal syncope and other forms of syncope. About 50% of all syncopal episodes cannot be identified as to etiology. However, a benign outcome for a single syncopal episode, non-cardiac in origin, is the norm. The diagnosis of syncope is discussed, emphasizing that a meticulous history from an observer or the patient, a good physical examination, and an ECG are the cornerstones of diagnosis. Other diagnostic venues are discussed. Convulsive syncope occurs in only about 12% of syncopal episodes, 65% of these being vasovagal in origin. The other 35% are due to a variety of causes. We found no good algorithm to differentiate convulsive syncope from epilepsy. We reviewed the literature to develop a differential diagnostic table, focusing on: age, awake status, position, emotional/physiologic stressors, onset, aura, appearance, injury on falling, seizure characteristics, automatism, length of unconsciousness and subsequent confusion, pulse characteristics, blood pressure, urinary incontinence, seizure duration, recovery time post-event, post-seizure sequelae, amnesia, posture vs. recovery, EEG characteristics, and the value of sophisticated diagnostic procedures.",

      "title": "Burnout, Drop Out, Suicide: Physician Loss in Emergency Medicine, Part I.",
      "abstract": "Each year more than 400 physicians take their lives, likely related to increasing depression and burnout. Burnout-a psychological syndrome featuring emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment-is a disturbingly and increasingly prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, and emergency medicine (EM) in particular. As self-care based solutions have proven unsuccessful, more system-based causes, beyond the control of the individual physicians, have been identified. Such system-based causes include limitations of the electronic health record, long work hours and substantial educational debt, all in a culture of no mistakes allowed. Blame and isolation in the face of medical errors and poor outcomes may lead to physician emotional injury, the so-called second victim syndrome, which is both a contributor to and consequence of burnout. In addition, emergency physicians (EP) are also particularly affected by the intensity of clinical practice, the higher risk of litigation, and the chronic fatigue of circadian rhythm disruption. Burnout has widespread consequences, including poor quality of care, increased medical errors, patient and provider dissatisfaction, and attrition from medical practice, exacerbating the shortage and maldistribution of EPs. Burned-out physicians are unlikely to seek professional treatment and may attempt to deal with substance abuse, depression and suicidal thoughts alone. This paper reviews the scope of burnout, contributors, and consequences both for medicine in general and for EM in particular.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

Essential features offunctionaldyspepsia include persistent pain or discomfort above the umbilicus, not associated with or relieved by a change of stool frequency or form, as well as a lack of evidence for inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic conditions. In about 50 % of adults and greater than 70 % of children, the pathophysiology of symptoms of functional dyspepsia is related to abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal motor function, such as delayed gastric and small intestinal transit, decreased gastric accommodation, and gastric dysrhythmia. Diagnostic evaluation should be driven by an index of clinical suspicion based on pertinent red flags in the history and physical examination. A comprehensive treatment approach uses the biopsychosocial model, which involves a combination of educational, pharmacological, psychological, as well as complementary therapies. Determining the patient's most distressing symptom may also help to target particular treatment options and individualize therapy. Follow-up of dyspeptic patients at 6 months to 2 years revealed that 70 % of subjects were either asymptomatic or much improved regardless of the cause; however, the remainder had neither improvement nor worsening of their symptoms despite aggressive medical management.",

Stress can regulate the level of hormones and immune inflammation in the body through the brain network, neural circuits, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, thereby causing the occurrence of mental disorders. In addition, stress can mediate the occurrence of mental disorders by regulating molecular changes in the level of genes, transcription, protein and metabolism, etc. Studies have shown that the brain-gut axis also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stress-related mental disorders. However, the pathophysiological mechanism of stress-related mental disorders remains unclear. Besides, studies have also shown that the onset of stress-related mental disorders is closely associated with the individual's physiological and psychological qualities,which has a cross-talk with other mental and physical diseases as well. Therefore, it is important to study individual premorbid diathesis clinical, and to conduct clinical medical, basic medical, and psychological studies of the different stages of the disease, so as to obtain further understanding of the pathogenesis of stress-related mental disorders.",

      "abstract": "Placebo and nocebo effects are, respectively, the helpful and harmful treatment effects that do not arise from active treatment components. These effects have thus far been researched most often in pain. It is not yet clear to what extent these findings from pain can be generalized to other somatic symptoms. This review investigates placebo and nocebo effects in four other highly prevalent symptoms: dyspnea, fatigue, nausea, and itch. The role of learning mechanisms (verbal suggestions, conditioning) in placebo and nocebo effects on various outcomes (self-reported, behavioral, and physiological) of these different somatic symptoms is explored. A search of experimental studies indicated that, as in pain, the combination of verbal suggestion and conditioning is generally more effective than suggestion alone for evoking placebo and nocebo effects. However, conditioning appears more and verbal suggestions less relevant in symptoms other than pain, with the exception of placebo effects on fatigue and nocebo effects on itch. Physiological measures, such as heart rate, lung function, or gastric activity, are rarely affected even when self-reported symptoms are. Neurobiological correlates are rarely investigated, and few commonalities appear across symptoms. Expectations generally predict placebo and nocebo effects for dyspnea and itch but seem less involved in fatigue and nausea. Individual characteristics do not consistently predict placebo or nocebo effects across symptoms or studies. In sum, many conclusions deriving from placebo and nocebo pain studies do appear to apply to other somatic symptoms, but a number of important differences exist. Understanding what type of learning mechanisms for which symptom are most likely to trigger placebo and nocebo effects is crucial for generalizing knowledge for research and therapies across symptoms and can help clinicians to optimize placebo effects in practice.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Introduction Anomalies of bodily experience have for long been described as relevant features of schizophrenia and major depression, yet such experiences are usually neglected in clinical examination. Bodily experience is the implicit background of our experiences against which we develop a coherent sense of self as a unified, bounded entity, naturally immersed in a social world of meaningful others. Such tacit experiential background is often perturbed in schizophrenia and major depression. Empirical research shows that patients with schizophrenia and major depression frequently present many different kinds of anomalies of bodily experience in the course of their illness. Objective To characterize the abnormal bodily phenomena in both schizophrenia and major depression. Aim To improve differential diagnosis based on the identification of typical features of abnormal bodily experiences in persons affected by schizophrenia and major depression and to provide supplementary diagnostic criteria. Method Analysis of empirical and theoretical research published in the last 25 years. Result Ongoing bodily feelings of disintegration/violation and nothingness/mechanization (e.g. one's body experienced as a object-like mechanism) are the most typical experiences in people with schizophrenia whereas major depressives are not able to detach themselves from the experience of bodily failure or chrematization (from chrema = corpse, i.e., feeling like a corpse) and therefore, feel worthless, guilty, or decaying. They feel chrematized in their very self. Conclusion These experiences might be considered as specific and they can contribute to differential diagnosis of somatic complaints in schizophrenia and in major depression.

However, the concept of personality disorder still remains diaphanous, and requires further clarification. One complication is that personality disorder can be seen from either the perspective that is a milder variant of other Axis I disorders, or that it is an abnormally exaggerated form of normal personality traits. That the disorders can be grouped according to these viewpoints indicates that there may be heterogeneity within them, while they have common characteristics: a long duration, extended areas of affected functioning, subtle and marginal severity of symptoms, and \"person-near\" nature. These features may also account for the difficulty in defining and assessing the disorder. Treatment is another important focus for discussion. Patient-therapist cooperation is essential and of itself is a difficult goal. Most failures of the therapeutic relationship lead to a variety of problems, including legal or ethical ones. Prerequisites for involuntary treatment, remedies for the risk of treatment disruption by violent acting-out and preventing malpractice are issues to be discussed.

Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "abstract": "Whereas many definitions of fatigue include externally measurable decrements in force or performance, fatigue can be present with no change in the external output of the muscle. The maintenance of submaximal forces can be considered a compromise between neuromuscular force enhancement and competing inhibitory influences. An example of a muscle facilitatory process includes postactivation potentiation that results in an increased sensitivity to Ca ++ . The neuromuscular system copes with metabolic disruption and subsequent loss of force by recruiting additional motor units and increasing the firing frequency. If the contraction persists, firing frequency may decrease so as to optimize the stimulus rate with the prolonged duration of the muscle fibre action potential (muscle wisdom). The insertion of additional neural impulses into the train of stimuli can result in force potentiation (catch-like properties). Furthermore, there is evidence of neural potentiation and a dissociation of muscle activity with submaximal fatigue. Conversely, inhibition may be derived supraspinally or at the spinal level. While there may be some evidence of intrinsic motoneuronal fatigue, inhibitory afferent influences from chemical, tensile, pressure, and other factors play an important role in the competing influences on force output. Key words: postactivation potentiation, recruitment, rate coding, inhibition, catch-like properties",

It causes suffering to many who go undiagnosed, and it burdens families and institutions providing care for the elderly by disabling those who might otherwise be able-bodied. What makes depression in the elderly so insidious is that neither the victim nor the health care provider may recognize its symptoms in the context of the multiple physical problems of many elderly people. Depressed mood, the typical signature of depression, may be less prominent than other depressive symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeplessness, anergia, and loss of interest in, and enjoyment of, the normal pursuits of life. There is a wide spectrum of depressive symptoms as well as types of available therapies. Because of the many physical illnesses and social and economic problems of the elderly, individual health care providers often conclude that depression is a normal consequence",

Newborn kittens and puppies lack the ability to maintain the body, as a whole, in an upright position. However, by one month of age, the posture of a pediatric patient should mirror that of an adult. Abnormal posture may be due to skeletal, muscular, and/or nervous system dysfunction. A head tilt is a specific type of abnormal posture that occurs with frequency in clinical practice. In dogs and cats, head tilts commonly result from infectious or inflammatory middle or inner ear disease, neurologic insult, or ischemic injury. Head tilts may occur in isolation; however, more commonly they are concurrent with other manifestations of neurologic disease, including ataxia, circling, facial nerve paralysis, falling, leaning, rolling, nystagmus, and/or positional strabismus. The presence of one or more of these clinical signs facilitates prioritization of differentials. This chapter cannot provide an exhaustive review of each clinical sign and differential diagnosis. Instead, the chapter emphasizes those conditions that are most commonly seen in clinical practice: peripheral vestibular syndrome, as caused by otitis media, otitis interna, and old dog vestibular syndrome; central vestibular syndrome, as caused by intracranial neoplasia and metronidazole toxicity; as well as canine hypothyroidism, which causes both.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Functional somatic syndromes are increasingly diagnosed in chronically ill patients presenting with an array of symptoms not attributed to physical ailments. Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, or irritable bowel syndrome are common disorders that belong in this broad category. Such syndromes are characterised by the presence of one or multiple chronic symptoms including widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disorders, and abdominal pain, amongst other issues. Symptoms are believed to relate to a complex interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, where a definite aetiology has not been established. Theories suggest causative pathways between the immune and nervous systems of affected individuals with several risk factors identified in patients presenting with one or more functional syndromes. Risk factors including stress and childhood trauma are now recognised as important contributors to chronic pain conditions. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse during childhood is considered a severe stressor having a high prevalence in functional somatic syndrome suffers. Such trauma permanently alters the biological stress response of the suffers leading to neuroexcitatory and other nerve issues associated with chronic pain in adults. Traumatic and chronic stress results in epigenetic changes in stress response genes, which ultimately leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the autonomic nervous system, and the immune system manifesting in a broad array of symptoms. Importantly, these systems are known to be dysregulated in patients suffering from functional somatic syndrome. Functional somatic syndromes are also highly prevalent co-morbidities of psychiatric conditions, mood disorders, and anxiety. Consequently, this review aims to provide insight into the role of the nervous system and immune system in chronic pain disorders associated with the musculoskeletal system, and central and peripheral nervous systems.",

Diagnosis is usually based on a typical medical history, electromyographic investigation and exclusion of other diseases presenting similar features. We report a case of PPS in a 49-year-old woman diagnosed in the Neurological Department in Zabrze. Thirty six years after acute anterior poliomyelitis with partial recovery, new symptoms of fatigue, muscular atrophy, exertional dyspnea, walking impairment and joint pain developed. Electromyography revealed features of coexisting spinal denervation and reinnervation in tested muscles. The differential diagnosis excluded other neuromuscular diseases. The patient fulfilled clinical and electromyographic criteria of PPS.",

A variety of psychological factors have been reported to be either predisposing or precipitating causes of migraine. Among the predisposing factors have been various personality attributes; neurosis and other psychiatric disorders. Among the precipitating factors are emotional reactions, changes in life situation; various psychosocial stresses, periods of overactivity and 'let down' periods. In addition to the operation of the above psychological factors, which constitute a psychosomatic sequence of events, there are also mood changes which may accompany an attack of migraine associated with alterations in energy, concentration, and ability to work. There may also be a somatopsychic sequence of events in which the sufferer may react in various ways to an attack of migraine just as he may react to any other illness or disability.",

      "title": "Elementary concepts of medicine: VII. Course of illness: manifestations, complications, outcome",
      "abstract": "Once the illness-defining somatic anomaly has come into being, the course of illness begins. The course is characterized, in its patient-relevant respects, by sickness manifestations (if any) and consequences of the illness (if any), of the illness-defining somatic anomaly. The course of the illness-defining anomaly per se, divorced from its manifestations and consequences, is not relevant to the affected person. A manifestation of an illness is something that, to one extent or another, reflects the presence of the illness-defining anomaly and, on this basis, is indicative of the anomaly's presence. It thus is an available fact simultaneous with the illness at issue – a positive finding of this kind, possibly a report (objective) of a symptom (subjective) or an inherently objective sign gleaned from physical examination or a laboratory test. Any such fact may be at variance with the corresponding truth, which may be difficult to define even. A manifestational fact, however accurate, is not inherently an effect of the somatic anomaly involved in the illness concept; different from effect, it may not be even of the form of a change but merely of a state of being. Even more notably, a patient-relevant manifestation, already present or potentially developing in the future, is integral to the very concept of illness, and it therefore is not really a consequence of illness, causally or otherwise. A consequence of an illness we take to be something wholly extrinsic to the illness. Consequences of illness in this meaning obviously fall into the principal categories of medical (i.e. somatic) and extramedical. Medical consequences we take to be of three generic types: complication, sequela and fatality. Under complication in our medical dictionaries, we find the following definitions: '(1) a disease or diseases concurrent with another disease; (2) the occurrence of two or more diseases in the same patient' (Dorland 1994); and 'morbid process or event occurring during a disease that is not an essential part of the disease, although it may result from it or from independent causes' (Stedman 1995). Although these definitions are surprising to us, they do accord with our idea (above) that a complication of an illness, different from its manifestations, is extrinsic to this illness, and more specifically also another illness, they do not identify complication as inherently a consequence of the illness. As for our proposition that a complication of an illness is a consequence of this illness, a couple of paradigmatic examples may serve to substantiate it. Peptic ulcer and peritonitis are two mutually distinct illnesses. When, and only when, the latter occurs as a consequence of the former, it is referred to as a complication of the former. Similarly, when, and only when, pulmonary embolism results from (occurs as a consequence of) deep-vein thrombosis, it is seen as a complication of the latter. In the meaning of consequence of an illness, thus, complication actually, and more specifically, is another illness caused by the illness at issue. It thus is another illness for which the original illness was aetiogenetic (aetiologic). As for the first example, it should be understood that perforated ulcer is but a stage in the course of ulcer and not another illness, and that it thus is not a complication of ulcer. Similarly, detachment of a segment of deep-vein thrombus is but an event in the course of that thrombosis and not a complication of it. Our medical dictionaries define the essence of sequela as: 'any lesion or affection following or caused by an attack of disease' (Dorland 1994); 'a condition following as a consequence of a disease' (Stedman 1995). Immunity resulting from an infectious disease satisfies the latter definition, but it is not thought of as a sequela of the disease. From the medical vantage, a sequela is not something desirable, nor even an innocent lesion; it is a somatic anomaly other than that which is definitional to the original illness, and it is one that already is, or in the future potentially will be, manifest in sickness. Thus, the medically relevant concept of sequela, like that of complication, has illness as its proximate genus. And further, while a distinction indeed is to be made between sequela and complication, a sequela of an illness is not caused by the illness at issue; it is a non-causal consequence of it. Thus, it is another illness for which the first illness was pathogenetic (rather than aetiogenetic; cf. complication above). This concept of sequela gains clarity when the nature of its non-causal connection to its parent illness is understood to represent a type of outcome of the original illness – just as any illness other than injury is the outcome of its pathogenesis. Stroke is an acute (i.e. non-chronic) disease, and a common outcome of it (of its completed course) is survival with a residual anomaly (chronic defect) in the tissues where the disease process took place. If this residual, post-stroke anomaly is manifest in sickness (say, paralysis), the anomaly represents patent sequela; if sickness is but a potential manifestation in the future, it represents latent sequela; and otherwise the outcome is survival with mere non-illness, non-sequela, innocent anomaly as a residue of it, the outcome now being complete recovery (to effective normalcy, with no material consequences as for outcome). It needs to be understood that just as perforated ulcer is not a causal consequence but merely a stage in the course of peptic ulcer, a sequela of stroke is not a causal consequence but, again, merely the anomaly stage that follows the completion of the course of the somatic process of stroke. Status post mortem is a sequela of life without being caused by life, nor is the transitional event death caused by life. For a sequela, the antecedent, original illness indeed represents pathogenesis (which is a merely descriptive concept) rather than aetiogenesis (which is a causal concept). Beyond sequela and complete recovery, the remaining principal type of outcome of illness, and equally a genuine potential consequence of illness, is of course fatality, death resulting from that illness. (When death results from some other, unrelated cause during the illness at issue, the course of this illness is thereby interrupted and its outcome does not materialize at all.) Different from sequela but akin to complication, the illness is causal to its fatal outcome, although only in the sense that it made death occur earlier than it otherwise would have occurred; but as it is not another illness, it therefore is not a complication. And because the fatal outcome is only the transitional event between living with the illness and being dead from it, and thus not a residual anomaly in vivo, at issue is a type of outcome different in form from that of sequela also. It deserves note that an illness commonly is not the direct, immediate cause of its fatal outcome. Instead, the immediate cause commonly is a complication of the illness to which the death is ascribed – or it is a complication of a complication, possibly many causal steps removed from the illness. Moreover, causation of death from a given illness can be mediated by its sequelae just the same. The illness that is designated as the cause thus commonly is merely a mediate, an underlying cause of the death. As we think of the course of illness in terms of its potential sickness manifestations and the potential medical consequences (complications, sequelae and fatality), we thereby exclude quality-of-life implications of sickness. A meteorologist is concerned with meteorological manifestations and consequences of whatever meteorological situation, but not with its agricultural (or farmers' happiness) implications, for example. A farmer's expert horizon on implications of weather is confined to those in the domain of farming, and the same applies to the implications of farming activities: issues of food production are within the farmer's expertise, effects of food consumption on people's health and happiness are not. Medically, the consequences of illness are medical (i.e. somatic). Health-related quality of life thus is a concern beyond the scope of medicine (Miettinen 2001).",

While it can indeed be a symptom accompanying other mental illnesses, it is also a full-blown disorder unto itself, recognized by every major diagnostic manual. Chapter 1 discusses the symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder through historical documentation and personal stories. The core symptoms, as outlined in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, include detachment from one’s whole self or from aspects of the self (such as feelings, thoughts, the body, and agency), as well as detachment from the outside world. Origins of the term “depersonalization” are discussed, and historical as well as current descriptions of symptoms are brought to life through personal quotes and stories. These substantiate depersonalization/derealization as an independent syndrome rather than simply a symptom of other disorders. This chapter sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of this fascinating, multifaceted, and under-researched condition.",

Abdominal, groin, and perineal pain can be of visceral, neuropathic, musculoskeletal, related to cancer or psychogenic origins. Chronic pain localized to the abdomen, groin, and/or perineum can have multiple etiologies ranging from focal sites of inflammation to idiopathic systemic diseases. Pain experienced in the abdomen, groin, and/or perineum may arise from pathology of the nervous system innervating those structures or may originate in the viscera, vascular structures or musculoskeletal-articular stuctures in the region. Other sources of chronic abdominal visceral pain as well as urogenital and rectal pain syndromes producing groin and perineal symptomatology all have correlates with these disorders and diagnostic work-ups and therapies are similar. Chronic pain with abdominal, groin, or perineal localization is a common clinical entity with multiple etiologies both known and unknown. Numerous other painful disorders with abdominal, groin, or perineal symptomatology will then briefly be discussed as \"correlates\" of the archetypal disorders.",

Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

Multiple factors, such as general health of the patient, chronic illnesses, psychiatric/psychological disorders, and socio-cultural factors, alone or in combination can be attributed to the development of psychosexual dysfunctions. The symptoms of these disorders vary for each individual and differ with gender. These disorders may be categorized as sexual dysfunction, paraphilias, and gender identity disorders. Dermatologists are sometimes consulted for sexual dysfunctions in their routine practice by the patients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics because a majority of the patients believe that these problems are caused by dysfunctions in the sex organs, and because people are hesitant to go to sexuality clinics and psychiatrists for such problems. Sometimes these patients are referred from other specialties such as urology or gynecology; most often, we attempt to search for STIs or other dermatoses on the genitalia and refer them back. We often underestimate the prevalence of sexual concerns of the patients or feel uncomfortable discussing matters of sexuality with them. Dermatologists should understand basic sexual medicine and ask patients for sexual problems. They should be trained to manage such patients accordingly. In this review, we will be focusing on sexual dysfunctions, their etiopathogenesis, and management from a dermatologist's perspective.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The co-existence of depression and chronic disease is frequent. This association leads to a worse evolution, of both the psychiatric framework and the chronic disease. However, the depression diagnosis is not always evident and even when it is identified correctly it is often under-treated, either for reasons imputable to the doctor or due to the patient's poor adhesion to the therapeutics. Description of the case: Maria frequently attends medical appointments complaining of dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue and bone and joint pains. The identified health problems include entities with a potential aetiological role in these symptoms, which are overvalued by the patient. However, the latter complied only irregularly with the pharmaceutical therapeutics and kept lifestyle detrimental to the control of such health problems. After multiple appointments of similar pattern she admitted, upon questioning, irritability, anhedonia, tendency for social isolation, hypersomnia and depressive humour, which she attributed to her physical aflictions. After several attempts to introduce anti-depressive medication, which the patient waived a few days later, alleging side effects, medical appointments at fortnight intervals resulted in a better compliance with the therapeutics, both anti-depressive and other, less complaints and better control of her chronic diseases. Comment: The emphasis on the somatic symptoms and the fact that they could be explained within the context of the patient's co-morbidity, therefore withdrawn as criteria of depression suspicion, led to the masking of the latter over time. The doctor must always consider the frequency of depression associated with chronic diseases, in order to achieve better diagnosis acuity. The inclusive approach, accounting for symptoms that are irrespective of being explained by the coexisting pathology, lessens the risk of not diagnosing an oligosymptomatic depressive framework, notwithstanding the fact that it may generate false-positive features. On the contrary, the excluding approach used for some time retarded the (false-negative) diagnosis and the treatment, with repercussions on the control of the whole health problems and on the patient's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Cases of Senile Insanity, with Remarks",
      "abstract": "Admitting the difficulties that one has in the classification of insanity, it seems to me, at all events, reasonable that we should recognise classes associated with definite physical changes. Symptoms may be ever changing and deceptive. A patient may to all appearances be weak-minded, but on recovery it may be found that such patient's apparent abstraction and mental weakness were merely the result of an overbearing and overpowering sense of misery, so that, in fact he was suffering distinctly from melancholia, and the mental faculties were in abeyance through the assertion of other painful sensations. A severe grief or an intense occupation of any kind may make one forgetful of his surroundings, regardless of the state of the weather, the time of day, the condition of one's general health, and so on; and so it is that in many cases of profound melancholy there is an apparent arrest of function. This by the way. We have to consider the fact that at certain periods of life there are certain special tendencies to an intellectual breakdown. Any serious affection of the brain in early childhood so affects the as yet undeveloped structure that it totters readily to its fall, and, once having suffered a severe shock, it is with difficulty restored. In the period of adolescence other functions of the body are developed, and with them many stirring sensations are aroused, which have a great tendency to upset the highly nervous and unstable neurotic patient. As life progresses some people exhibit marked tendencies to die out through their nervous systems. Certain persons develope phthisis late in life; others develop cancer, gout, chronic rheumatism, or other constitutional vices. But the thing that interests me most in this consideration is that there are definite forms of disease seen in patients dying out from exhaustion or wearing out of their nervous tissues. As has so often been said, age is purely relative. A man may be a boy at 70 or an old man at 35. Age, from the physician's side, is a relative advance towards decay and destruction of the most important of the vital tissues and organs. A man may have all his organs slowly degenerating before he has reached middle life, the degeneration being due to some constitutional disease, or to some such condition as atheroma of the vessels. In an asylum one constantly comes across patients who have inherited insanity from their parents, and who have inherited a special form of insanity, and even others who have not inherited any special form, but have inherited the tendency which produced the insanity; thus whereas one person has atheroma of the vessels and dies of apoplexy, another has atheroma of his vessels and dies of aneurism, and another patient has atheroma of his vessels and angina pectoris, so that the offspring of these patients may have not only the atheroma of the artery, but either the apoplexy, the aneurism, or the angina pectoris, according to whether the parents had the one or the other. I have seen many cases in which a parent has suffered from mental disease only when he has become 60 or 70, and the children have gone on very well until they reached a similar age, and then have broken down under similar circumstances in a very similar way. It would not be right always to say that this has no relationship to mental effects and to predispositions. One knows that suicide, for instance, is not only associated with a family disposition to nervous disease, but is in many cases also associated with a dominant idea which has from early days been before the patient's mind—that suicide has been, as it were, the evil genius of the family; and so the fact that a parent has died of nervous breakdown has been reported to a patient, or has been remembered by him, and when he comes to a like age he necessarily thinks more about the fate of his parent, and this alone, in some temperaments, might be a cause of producing insanity. In some families it is very noteworthy that a certain age is looked upon as being critical, and if that age be satisfactorily passed, the individual may live to a considerable age beyond, but immediately before this crucial period many members have begun with ailments and have certainly worried themselves into their graves. But what I would distinctly assert is that in certain families the tendency is to die of some affection of the nervous system in preference to dying by any other system; and it is interesting to note that in some of these cases the tendency is not always transmitted in exactly the same way, but that the offspring of such parents, if they have not been placed in otherwise favourable circumstances, may break down earlier in life; and although I am not in a position to assert positively that such is the case, many instances have inclined me to the belief that the offspring of those parents who have broken down, say at the climacteric or from advanced age, are more liable than other insane patients to break down at special periods, such as at adolescence and the climacteric. When one comes to consider the changes that we mean by old age, I should say that the mark I have used as the test as to atheromatous condition of the arteries is seen by the tortuous temporal arteries, and the rigid and rather high-tension in the radial pulse. Other symptoms, such as capillary congestion about the cheeks, white hair, and a tendency to leanness, have, of course, been considered, as well as the condition of the eye called arcus senilis . All the patients to whom I shall refer have the above characteristics, as well as years over 60. They suffer either from progressive dementia, with or without paralysis, or from melancholia of one form or another. As we shall see presently, they suffered from hypochondriacal symptoms, or in some cases exhibited maniacal excitement with exaltation, and I shall have to refer specially to at least one case in which these symptoms were so markedly like those of general paralysis of the insane that I was constantly asking myself in what the difference consisted between our typical cases of general paralysis of the insane and cases such as the one under consideration. We were obliged to confess that if the patient had been brought before us, and that blindfold we had been told that his age was 35, we should not have hesitated for a moment in saying that his was a typical case of the disease. General paralysis does occur in old men sometimes as well as in young men, but it is not nearly so common, and when we meet with these cases wo are obliged to consider them as a special sub-variety of the disease, or else must look upon them merely as cases of degradation of nerve tissue, having somewhat similar symptoms, to the symptoms seen in general paralysis of the insane. I am rather fond of regarding these cases as not truly those of general paralysis, but as examples of progressive nerve degeneration, and I prefer to look upon symptoms of general paralysis of the insane as symptoms that are produced solely by a steady and progressive degeneration of the highest nerve centres; and under these circumstances I would expect that any disease which produced steady, progressive degeneration of these highest centres would also produce similar symptoms, just as in the lung, whether it be a tubercle, a mass of smoke, or a piece of steel or stone that sets up irritation, inflammation, degeneration, and a cavity, the course and symptoms of the disease are the same.",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

Those who have made inquiries along this line have brought to light much evidence of physiological abnormality in schizophrenia, associated particularly with the function of the autonomic nervous system. Hoskins,<sup>1</sup>in 1946, published the results of many years of physiological research, comprising studies of endocrine function, metabolism, circulation and various homeostatic mechanisms. Many other workers have contributed pertinent data to this subject. The over-all impression gained from a review of this literature is that the chief physiological defect in schizophrenia is in the sphere of homeostasis, with diminished adaptability to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli. Dysfunction at the cortical or the hypothalamic level has been implicated most frequently in the explanation of the observed impairment",

      "abstract": "Empirical studies have recently demonstrated that major and minor depressive disorders occur in 30–50% of stroke patients, and last more than one year without treatment, although they do respond to tricyclic antidepressants. These mood disorders are not strongly associated with severity of impairment, demographic characteristics, social supports or prior personal history, but major depression is often strongly associated with left frontal or left basal ganglia lesions and pre-existing subcortical atrophy. While the aetiology of these mood disorders remains unknown, serotonergic or noradrenergic dysfunction may play a role. Mania is a rare complication of stroke: the clinical presentation and response to treatment are usually the same as mania without brain injury. Post-stroke mania is strongly associated with both a right hemisphere lesion in a limbic-connected area and a second predisposing factor, such as genetic loading for affective disorder, pre-existing subcortical atrophy or seizure disorder. This disorder may be mediated through frontal lobe dysfunction. The lesion method represents a potentially fruitful technique for investigating the mechanisms of affective disorder.",

The aim of the work is to systematize and analyze the data about drugs that can cause the development of drug-induced hypertension, as well as on epidemiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, clinical picture, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, treatment and prevention of drug-induced hypertension. As a result of data analysis, it was revealed that drugs: glucocorticosteroids, antineoplastic drugs, immunosuppressants, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, antidepressants and some others are associated with the development of hypertension. The mechanisms of development of drug-induced arterial hypertension are not fully established and require further study. Drug-induced arterial hypertension is still one of the most common and often unrecognized adverse reactions. The clinical manifestations of drug-induced hypertension are not speciﬁc. The symptoms are associated with target organ damage or complications of hypertension and may include a headache, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, anxiety, shortness of breath, etc. patients with previously well-controlled hypertension or cases of uncontrolled hypertension. Therefore, it is always necessary to pay attention to the patient’s history, pharmacological anamnesis, rapid increases in blood pressure in patients with previously well-controlled hypertension, or cases of uncontrolled hypertension.",

This dizziness almost always occurs either spontaneously or as a result of certain movements or positions. Examination of the patients usually reveals no clinical signs to explain this complaint of dizziness, and therefore these patients are usually labeled as having some type of neurosis.

      "title": "Clinical characteristics and treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar depression",
      "abstract": "Depression represents the predominant mood pole in bipolar disorder. Bipolar depression typically has a poor response to antidepressant medication, and also involves the risk of polarity shifts, induction of mixed states, and / or rapid cycle induction. The diagnosis of bipolar depression can be delayed by 8 to 10 years. The reason for this delay is mainly the fact that both manic and hypomanic episodes appear lately in the course of the disorder. It is therefore necessary to diagnose this clinical entity as early as possible versus monopolar depression in order to treat it more effectively. This differential diagnosis is based on certain clinical features of bipolar depression, which are often difficult to be distinguished from those of monopolar depression and therefore it is necessary to know specific criteria that differentiate them to some extent qualitatively and / or quantitatively. Such characteristics are daily mood swings, multiple physical complaints, psychomotor retardation, psychotic elements (delusions and perceptual disorders mood congruent or noncongruent), the disturbance of certain bodily functions, including circadian rhythms, sexual desire, appetite, and disorders of sleep architecture. The treatment of bipolar depression is based on the options known from monopolar depression (such as the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and certain antiepileptic agents) and their combinations, while in recent years it has been enriched with new pharmaceutical agents and non-pharmacological approaches. New glutaminergic regulators dominate the new pharmacological agents' research, and among them the antidepressant effect of ketamine and esketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is being extensively investigated during recent years. Non-pharmacological approaches include methods such as electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), sleep deprivation, and phototherapy.",

      "abstract": "The burnout syndrome represents a set of symptoms arising in a situation of prolonged stress at the workplace, in professionally demanding situations. It is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment. One of the tools used to measure the level of burnout is MBI. It has often been criticized for conceptual, methodological and practical reasons; however, it is still considered the gold standard for assessing burnout and is used in 88% of all empirical studies. Factors that contribute to the development of burnout can be divided into organizational and individual factors. The complexity of work organization, as the crucial external factor, is reflected in the shaping of interpersonal relations, the establishment of hierarchies among employees, timely personnel planning and the need for professional training, which indirectly affects the degree of burnout of doctors. If one adds the need of doctors to engage in academic work, the failures in the medical system organization of the work are reflected in excessive working hours, devaluation of teaching work, inappropriate academic ranking, accumulation of engagements outside of teaching, pressure to publish papers and dissatisfaction with the criteria of scientific success. Personality traits can speed up or slow down the occurrence of burnout due to the nature of their influence. They play a big role in making this syndrome noticeable in extroverted people and vice versa, causing it to remain unrecognized and hidden in introverted people. Thus, they make it difficult for this syndrome to be registered and delay the provision of timely assistance. The occurrence of a burnout, which develops as a response to chronic professional stress, coupled with greater opportunities for professional development, better earnings and working conditions, as well as higher quality standards, are the key triggers of the migration of healthcare workers.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

Depression isassociated with cognitive impairment, which is exacerbated by postoperativeevents. There is evidence that postoperative pain is seriously depressing anddepression causes pain to worsen. Depression is also said to be a strong predictorand correlates with persistent postoperative pain.

PTSD first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980,1,,2 arising from studies of the Vietnam war, and of civilian victims of natural and man-made disasters.3,,4 However, the study of PTSD dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome.2,,3 The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. According to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-IV-TR),5 the essential feature of PTSD is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor characterized by: direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person reacts to this event with fear and helplessness, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. Traumatic events include military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration, natural or man-made disasters, automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. The principal symptoms of PTSD are the painful re-experiencing of the event, a pattern of avoidance and emotional numbing, and fairly constant hyperarousal.\n\nPost-traumatic reactions fall on a continuum, and many clinicians and researchers believe it is useful to conceptualize partial symptoms as well.2, …",

Anticipatory grief can be a particular challenge during palliative care. The family is recognized as the major source of social support and the environment in which grief is shared with others. Key risk factors for pathological bereavement outcomes can be identified on admission to palliative care, permitting preventive models of psychological care to be used through palliative care into bereavement. Models of therapy include supportive-expressive, interpersonal, cognitive behavioural, family focused, and specific therapy for complicated grief. Pharmacotherapy can judiciously accompany psychotherapy. Life-cycle issues include bereaved children, siblings, parents, and grief for the very elderly. Grief can be stigmatized and ambiguous in special circumstances, yet positive growth is a desirable outcome from any loss.",

The results of traumatic events on emotional state or behavior of child may be short term or long term, anyway they affect development. Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

People become more stable with sympathetic listening. The experience of loss and its associated feelings can be faced with acceptance, and even psychotic conditions can evaporate when the ring of isolation is broken. Refugees have a higher risk of mental illness than others, showing depression, anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder. Because little has been written about refugees from a mental health perspective, professionals working therapeutically with them may not give as much consideration to socio-political and psychosocial influences as to traumatic events experienced by refugees. The feelings of helplessness that some refugees experience can be seen as typical of many situations of trauma. Recent scientific literature, mainly in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has recognized post traumatic stress disorder, both acute and chronic, as a specific clinical entity.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts.

Current evidence is strongest for introversion as a possible premorbid trait in primary nonbipolar depressions. By contrast, driven, work-oriented obsessoid, extroverted, cyclothymic, and related dysthymic temperaments appear to be the precursors of bipolar disorders.

      "abstract": "Pain disorder is a psychiatric disorder diagnosed when the becomes the predominant focus of the clinical presentation and causes significant distress or impairment. Besides the high economic impact, there is a reciprocal relationship with the affective state. Pain is a subjective sensation and its severity and quality of experience in an individual is dependent on a complex mix of factors. In the treatment of acute pain, the primary purpose is relief, while chronic typically requires a combination of psychotropic drugs. In this context, it is also important to recognize and treat depression. Psychological treatments aimed at providing mechanisms to allow patients to control and live with the pain rather than aspire to eliminate it completely. A growing group of researchers proposes the elimination of the chapter of Somatoform Disorders and the modification of the category psychological factors affecting a medical condition to psychological factors affecting an identified or feared medical condition with clinical entities as ubchapters, largely based upon Diagnostics for Psychosomatic Research criteria.",

      "abstract": "The intentional killing of oneself is evidence not only of personal breakdown, but also of a deterioration of the social context in which an individual lives. Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

Psychomotor seizures occur in late childhood or adult life; they have a frequency approximating that of major convulsions, and the individual attack lasts from one to five or more minutes.

      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable feeling that tells you something may be wrong. It can be steady, throbbing, stabbing, aching, pinching, or described in many other ways. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, like a mild headache. Other times it can be debilitating. Pain can bring about other physical symptoms, like nausea, dizziness, weakness or drowsiness. It can cause emotional effects like anger, depression, mood swings or irritability. Pain can change your lifestyle and impact your job, relationships and independence. Pain is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pain is usually severe and short-lived, and is often a signal that your body has been injured. Chronic pain can range from mild to severe, is present for long periods of time, and is often the result of a disease that may require ongoing treatment. When we sense pain, we pay attention to our bodies and can take steps to fix what hurts. Pain also may prevent us from injuring a body part even more. If it didn't hurt to walk on a broken leg, a person might keep using it and cause more damage. If your throat is really sore, you'll probably go to the doctor, who can treat the infection if you have one. Pain itself often modifies the way the central nervous system processes pain, so that a patient actually becomes more sensitive and gets more pain with less provocation. This is called “central sensitization.” (And there’s peripheral sensitization too.) Sensitized patients are not only more sensitive to things that should hurt, but also to ordinary touch and pressure as well. Their pain also “echoes,” fading more slowly than in other people. This phenomenon is usually superimposed over other problems, but it can also occur acutely and be the primary issue, as in complex regional pain syndrome, or amplified pain syndrome, which disporportionately affects everyone.

      "abstract": "Cancer is the most feared of diseases.Unsurprisingly, it causes considerable psychological distress in patients, families, carers, and often those health professionals who care for them.Only a minority of cancer patients develop psychiatric illness, but other psychologically and socially determined problems are common.These include unpleasant symptoms such as pain, nausea, and fatigue; problems with finances, employment, housing, and childcare; family worries; and existential and spiritual doubts.Well planned care that fully involves patients and their families can minimise these problems. Psychological consequencesThough often dismissed as \"understandable,\" distress is a treatable cause of reduced quality of life and poorer clinical outcome.Some patients delay seeking help because they fear or deny their symptoms of distress.Presentation can be obvious, as depressed or anxious mood can manifest as increased severity of somatic complaints such as breathlessness, pain, or fatigue.Adjustment disorder is the commonest psychiatric diagnosis, and neuropsychiatric complications may occur.The risk of suicide is increased in the early stages of coping with cancer. DepressionDepression is a response to perceived loss.A diagnosis of cancer and awareness of associated losses may precipitate feelings similar to bereavement.The loss may be of parts of the body (such as a breast or hair), the role in family or society, or impending loss of life.Severe and persistent depressive disorder is up to four times more common in cancer patients than in the general population, occurring in 10-20% during the disease. Anxiety, fear, and panicAnxiety is the response to a perceived threat.It manifests as apprehension, uncontrollable worry, restlessness, panic attacks, and avoidance of people and of reminders of cancer, together with signs of autonomic arousal.Patients may overestimate the risks associated with treatment and the likelihood of a poor outcome.Anxiety may also exacerbate or heighten perceptions of physical symptoms (such as breathlessness in lung cancer), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (with intrusive thoughts and avoidance of reminders of cancer) occasionally follow diagnosis or treatment that has been particularly frightening.Certain cancers and treatments are associated with specific fears.Thus, patients with head and neck cancers may worry about being able to breathe and swallow.Patients may develop phobias and conditioned vomiting in relation to unpleasant treatments such as chemotherapy.",

La “psicosis instrumental” es una variante de simulación consistente en el fingimiento de síntomas por parte de un individuo con diagnóstico subyacente de una psicosis primaria y que simula sus síntomas en momentos de estabilidad clínica. Se presentan dos casos de personas con diagnóstico primario de esquizofrenia que pueden ser considerados también como aparentes casos de psicosis instrumental.

They are less commonly diagnosed than migraine, their pathophysiology is poorly understood, and evidence for their treatment is mostly anecdotal. Importantly, however, although considered primary headaches after a period of observation, many can present, at least initially, as manifestations of other conditions. Whereas headaches such as primary stabbing headache and hypnic headache are primary in most instances, others, such as those attributed to exercise or sexual activity or thunderclap headache, may present acutely in an emergency department setting, in which imaging and other testing may be appropriate to rule out secondary causes.",

And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome.

      "title": "Pseudobulbar affect masquerading as psychosis: Managing a case of diagnostic dilemma",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA) is a clinical condition characterized by uncontrollable emotional outbursts, incongruent with the person's emotional state and often out of keeping with the situational context. It manifests mostly as uncontrollable laughter or crying in inappropriate situations.[1] PBA is also referred to as Emotional incontinence, Pathological Laughter and Crying (PLC), and Involuntary Emotional Expression Disorder (IEED).[2] PBA is most commonly seen occurring in the background of neurological disorders like in post-stroke period, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury.[3-5] However, it can also be seen without any apparent neurological disorders.[5] Historically PBA has been an under-recognized and under-treated condition, which brings in significant distress, stigma and shame for the person suffering from the condition.[6] Along with the social stigma of inappropriate laughing or crying, it often carries with it the burden of being tagged with mental illness.[7] The newer and probably less stigmatizing term IEED can provide some respite to those with the condition as an acknowledgement of their suffering. This case report presents a patient with PBA without any neurological comorbidities who improved significantly with fluoxetine and dextromethorphan. A 59-year-old, widowed female, coming from an urban background, presented with episodes of uncontrollable laughter spells in inappropriate situations for the past 1.5 years. She also reported occasional mild slurring and difficulty deglutition for the same duration. These laughter spells would occur every 2-3 days, occurring for 5-15 minutes. These would be typically incongruent to the context. For example, occurring while in inappropriate social situations like in a funeral house. These incidents would make her extremely embarrassed and she had to leave the situation altogether as she could not control her laughing. Her family members too would scold her for doing so, apparently a willful act as per them, and would ask her if she has gone mad. She would feel sad over these incidents and tell her family members that she was not doing this willfully and it was not under her control. These episodes were accompanied by on-and-off difficulty in deglutition, mild slurring of speech and a subjective sense of hypersalivation. These symptoms would aggravate prolonged speaking or chewing. All these incidents would occur with intact awareness and responsiveness. Sleep onset insomnia was present. There was no history of associated low or elevated mood, anhedonia, disproportionate physical fatigue, somatic preoccupation or dissociative episodes. Past psychiatric history revealed nothing significant. She was not known to be diabetic, hypertensive, hypothyroid or obese. There was no history of head injury, seizures or stroke either. She had never taken any substance of abuse. She was taken to psychiatrists as her family members thought she might be having some psychiatric illness. She was suspected to have psychosis, unspecified and was given trials of quetiapine up to 100 mg and later olanzapine up to 25 mg. Both these treatments improved her sleep only but no improvement was observed in the uncontrollable laughter episodes. On presentation, she was neither sad nor overtly cheerful, though expressed her worry and guilt about the inappropriate laughter episodes and social disgrace. No other thought or perceptual abnormality was noted. She had good insight into her symptoms. On neurological examination, speech was normal, jaw jerk and palmomental reflex were absent. Blood sugar, thyroid panel, lipids and electrolytes came out to be normal. We admitted her for diagnostic evaluation. Neurology and otorhinolaryngology consultation-liaison were sought. MRI Brain was suggested by neurology which came out to be normal. Based on the clinical presentation, examination and investigation findings we considered a diagnosis of Pseudo-bulbar affect of unknown etiology. Due to the unavailability of a Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination, we started her on Dextromethorphan 20 mg and Fluoxetine 40 mg. She tolerated the treatment without any side-effects. Over the next couple of days, she did not report much improvement and was discharged on the same treatment. She adhered to treatment and on follow-up visit one month later, she reported significant improvement in laughter spells, which occurred only once during that period. She had started attending social gatherings again without any issues. From the second follow up Dextromethorphan was gradually tapered and stopped; Fluoxetine has been continued. She is maintaining well on current treatment. We are regularly following her up in liaison with the Neurology team as over due course of time some underlying neurological cause may become evident. PBA is a disorder which is poorly recognized, variably characterized, and causes significant distress and dysfunction for patients and their families. Patients are often ascribed mental illnesses like schizophrenia or mania in many of these cases of PBA leading to unnecessary treatment.[8] Further, the drug side effect burden adds to the misery of the patients. Our patient had consulted several psychiatrists, who treated her with antipsychotics without much improvement in her symptoms. We could not find any underlying neurological condition despite a neurological workup but she responded well with treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan. The neurobiology of PBA is still unclear; most likely to be of multifactorial causation. Disruption of the cortico-limbic-subcortico-thalamic-pontocerebellar network, which is involved in the regulation and expression of emotion, has been hypothesized.[9] In many cases, no neurological association is found even after a thorough workup. A patient-rated instrument, Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is used commonly to rate the severity of PBA.[10] It is validated for use in patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS).[11] The Pathological Laughing and Crying Scale (PLACS) is another patient-rated instrument validated to rate the severity of PBA in post-stroke patients.[12] PBA is a clinical diagnosis. While these scales are not used to diagnose PBA, these are used to rate the severity and improvement with treatment. Treatment with SSRI and Dextromethorphan/quinidine has shown promising results in cases of PBA.[13,14] Our case emphasizes the need to have clinical suspicion in such cases presenting with unexplained mood outbursts before categorizing them as specific psychiatric illnesses.

      "title": "Transcultural Aspects of Somatic Symptoms in the Context of Depressive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms are a common presentation of mental disorders or psychological distress worldwide, and may often coexist with depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus accounting for what might be the most frequent psychiatric syndrome in primary care. Indeed, physical symptoms accompanying the clinical presentations of a variety of mental disorders may be considered as universal 'idioms of distress' that may vary across cultures, depending on attitudes and explanations embedded in each one of them. These variations in symptom presentations are the result of various interacting factors that ultimately determine how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness, and seek medical attention. This chapter examines the impact of culture on the experiencing of somatic symptoms, based on an inclusive review of the topic from ethnic, nosological, clinical and social perspectives. Particular attention is paid to the association of somatic symptoms with mood symptoms, since depressive disorders appear to be the most common, costly and disabling psychiatric entities worldwide. The review shows that racial/ethnic variations in somatic symptoms in the context of depression are common, and seem to be related to depression severity. Sociocultural factors, particularly stigma, may influence the unique emphasis placed on somatic symptoms within depression, and may account for some racial/ethnic differences in somatic symptom reporting.",

The symptoms of the condition identified with this diagnosis were supposed to have been produced by the blast effect of nearby exploding shells on the human brain. It was thought that the force of the blast transmitted through the air and into the cranial cavity disarranged the cytoarchitecture of the cortex by some sort of molecular disruption and that the brain so damaged produced the clinical signs that were associated with the condition. These were extreme irritability, pronounced startle reaction, bizarre tremors and automatic movements, some loss of memory, headaches and a decided drop in efficiency. The absence of neurologic signs with these symptoms and the total absence of other data that would indicate structural damage to the brain caused many at the time to doubt that these effects were due to",

      "abstract": "Fatigue has been cited as a causal factor in industrial, medical and transportation accidents. A common theme in the accident analyses has been the lack of knowledge about fatigue effects. What types of tasks are most susceptible to fatigue? How are the effects manifested? To answer these questions this article reviews the basic research on fatigue effects on performance of laboratory tasks. Tasks were categorised as vigilance, cognitive or psychomotor. Fatigue (as induced by sleep loss) consistently degrades vigilance performance regardless of task. Decrements include increased reaction time and decreased accuracy. For cognitive tasks, however, some researchers have reported increased time and decreased accuracy associated with fatigue, but not on all tasks or not consistently. For example, categorisation tasks show both decrements and no effects. Similar inconsistency exists for math (decrements and no decrements) and logical reasoning. However, fatigue consistently degrades tracking performance either performed alone or in a battery of tasks. In summary the research supports that at least in some cases of fatigue, humans cannot ‘see straight’, cannot ‘think straight’, cannot ‘do anything right’, cannot ‘seem to pay attention’ and cannot ‘lift a finger’.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper delineates mental load and stress as two related concepts that originate from different theoretical frameworks. A proper distinction between the two concepts is important, not only for theory building, but because it may lead also to different interpretations of experimental results, and, consequently, to different recommendations in applied situations. High workload is regarded as an important but not a critical factor in the development of stress symptoms. It is quite possible to work hard in difficult and complex tasks, even under unfavourable conditions, without cognitive strain, psychosomatic complaints, or adverse physiological effects. High task demands can be met by mobilizing extra energy through mental effort. This 'trying harder' reaction is a normal and healthy coping strategy to adapt to situational demands. In contrast, stress is regarded as a state in which the equilibrium between cognitive and energetical processes is disturbed by ineffective energy, mobilization and negative emotions. Stress typically is characterized by inefficient behaviour, overreactivity, and the incapacity to recover from work. Stress is regarded as a state in which the physiological system is disorganized, which results in decreased well-being, sleeping problems, psychosomatic complaints, and increased health risks.

This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "abstract": "Demoralization is a common psychiatric phenomenon among medically ill patients which presents as distress, subjective incompetence, hopelessness, and with feelings of rejection. Although it is common among medically ill patients, demoralization is often not recognized or diagnosed by non-psychiatric and psychiatric providers alike, especially in the setting of other psychiatric and medical comorbidities. In this article, we aim to show clinical differentiation of demoralization from other common mood disorders and a relatively similar psychiatric phenomenon such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study consists of a literature review and a case of a 55-year-old female with demoralization and comorbid PTSD in the setting of a long-term hospital stay due to multiple medical problems. We demonstrate the clinical presentation, differentiation, and treatment of demoralization with co-morbid PTSD. This literature review and case presentation is a unique opportunity to highlight the importance of recognizing and treating demoralization as a distinct and important clinical syndrome concurrently with other presenting psychiatric conditions such as PTSD. Better recognition and diagnosis of demoralization in clinical settings will likely help providers, especially in non-psychiatric medical services, have a better understanding of these patients and aid in communication and treatment in a way that can avoid reflexive use of pharmacological agents, prevent inadvertent negative perceptions of patients, and allow for incorporation of actionable therapeutic methods as part of the general treatment plan independent of involvement from Psychiatry.",

The canonical phenotypeof the Parkinson's disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executiveand visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness,or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

The nervous tension, caused by the irritating atmosphere of great cities, is obviously conducive to psycho-neurotic troubles; and, if a rigorist educative influence saddles a hypersensitive temperament afflicted by these troubles, with the result that religion is misconceived as a repressive legalism, the effect will almost inevitably be a false conscience perhaps for ever paralysed by scruples. Whenever it makes its appearance and for the same reasons, this disease either suddenly breaks out in a violent crisis or gradually spreads in a slow, consuming progression. Much has been written about this malady : descriptions of the disorder, descriptions of the supernatural trial, the attitude to be taken towards the scrupulous by confessor and director, psychotherapeutic treatments or others in obstinate and disconcerting cases. It would seem that nothing has been overlooked and that the subject is therefore exhausted. One is tempted to conclude : the whole question has been settled once and for all.

      "title": "Isn’t it Time to Use Opioid Drugs in Emergency Medical Services?",
      "abstract": "Pain is an unpleasant feeling and experience that is caused by a potential or practical injury and its control is so important that the American Pain Society has introduced pain as the 5 th vital sign for emphasizing the importance of pain and controlling it. Almost all humans have experienced moderate to severe pain and most of the time the experience has happened following surgical procedures, medical conditions or trauma. When pain manifests in a clinical condition, health care staff are responsible for following it and relieving it as a goal and responsibility. Pain affects all individuals regardless of age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status and untreated pain can negatively affect various systems of the body and lead to many consequences. Increase in serum level of cortisol, nor epinephrine, and renin angiotension, hyperglycemia, decrease in insulin, manifestation of anxiety, cardiac effects such as ischemia, dysrhythmia, increase in pulse, increase in cardiac load, increased oxygen uptake, increased blood coagulation potential, hypertension especially in patients with head injuries, decreased blood oxygen level, increased body fluid volume, drop in blood potassium, fatigue, muscle cramps, decreased immune system function, decreased ability for wound healing and etc. are among the undesirable side effects of pain. In addition, not treating acute pains also leads to bearing unnecessary pain, elongated duration of hospitalization, increased medical costs and probability of acute pain progressing and developing into chronic pain. The financial burden of not treating pain in America has been estimated to be about 100 billion dollars per year. Pain is a common complaint and makes up a considerable portion of reasons that patients call pre-hospital emergency services and is usually present in the injured and trauma patients. Study results showed that 20% to 31% of the patients presenting via ambulances had moderate and severe pain. Additionally, with 52% to 86% prevalence in emergencies, pain is a key topic in health care of various countries. Pre-hospital emergency staff members are the first in line among health care staff that face patients at times of disaster and accident and are more exposed to the patients’ pain. Despite the quantitative growth of pre-hospital emergency bases to 1900 bases throughout Iran, observations of researchers and evidence and instructions of emergency medical services (EMS) of Iran are indicative of not using enough analgesic drugs, especially opioid analgesic drugs, as a means to relieve patients’ pain in EMS ambulances. Some studies have mentioned that about one third of the pre-hospital patients and more than 80% of patients with bone fractures report moderate to severe pain and on the other hand the positive effect of using pain killers in the regions that used them have been shown to be obvious in most patients. It seems that using analgesics in EMS is a very important topic and researchers express that proper pain management is an important principle in pre-hospital care and opioid analgesics such as morphine and fentanyl have a special place in the instructions of EMS as treatments for acute trauma and non-trauma pains, especially cardiac chest pains, in some advanced countries regarding emergency care. Considering the afore-mentioned points concerning the importance of pain and its treatment, especially the importance of treating pain in traumatic and ischemic cardiac diseases, high prevalence of pain in pre-hospital missions, severity and type of pre-hospital missions, which are mostly associated with pain, high costs of not treating pain and the obvious need for using pain killers in trauma and ischemic cardiac diseases, isn’t it time to introduce a more effective and scientific approach in EMS? Isn’t it better to add a few types of analgesics and opioid drugs to the equipment provided at patients’ bedside, at least for ischemic cardiac diseases and severe trauma? Although the result of a study carried out in Khuzestan province showed that EMS staff members were weak regarding drug information and calculations and other studies have also expressed that drug dosage and use of opioid drugs might not be done correctly or opioid drugs might be abused in some cases, none are convincing reasons for not using these drugs. These problems could be solved by more and better training for EMS staff, creating offline and online protocols and useful programs for preventing abuse of analgesic drugs and these drugs could be effectively used in EMS. Therefore, we again note that this treatment priority should not be overlooked for any reason.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente. Les retentissements sont rapidement importants et concernent tous les domaines de la vie de l’enfant : perte d’autonomie, troubles du sommeil, anxiété, dépression, altération des liens sociaux et familiaux, absentéisme scolaire…Le diagnostic reste clinique, sur la base des critères de Budapest, même s’ils n’ont pas été validés en pédiatrie. Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée. Enfin, l’évolution semble meilleure que chez les adultes même si environ 20 % des enfants rechutent dans les six premiers mois le plus souvent.",

      "abstract": "Chronic therapy-resistant low back pain is a major problem in medical care. In Germany there are many millions concerned, and the treatment expenses range at the top. Many of these patients underwent non-successful operations at the vertebral column and suffered a long-lasting odyssey of therapies before they are treated psychosomatically for the first time. Chronic low back pain is a disease including social, psychological as well as physiological aspects, and not only a problem of bones, muscles, or intervertebral disks. The problem is similar to that of fibromyalgia. On the basis of 9,000 case reports obtained during psychosomatic orthopedic treatment, character structures, unsolved problems of life and repressed emotional disturbances such as anger, jealousy, fear, and mourning could be identified as major psychosomatic risk factors for chronic low back pain. There is a high coincidence with other psychosomatically influenced diseases such as gastric and duodenal ulcera, asthma bronchiale, migraine with depressions, anxiety disorders, character neuroses, and narcissistic and other structural disturbances of the self. Exclusively somatic treatments without considering the existential situation and psychological methods hold the danger of a symptom shifting. The inpatient treatment from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ('Tagesklinik') with a combination of medical, physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic methods promotes a social training that counteracts the increasing constrictions in the accustomed life surroundings caused by low back pain. Chronic low back pain is an 'illness of the upright walk' in an anthropological, ethical sense. Considering low back pain as a strictly somatic disease is a modern myth of a medical treatment without existential understanding of human illness. It provokes failure of treatment and an enhancement of treatment cost.",

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is common, is difficult to measure, can be associated with considerable morbidity, and is rarely a subject of controversy. The chronic fatigue syndrome also presents problems in definition and measurement, is associated with even more morbidity than chronic fatigue itself, and is often controversial. Particularly unclear is the way in which chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome relate to each other: Is one the severe form of the other, or are they qualitatively and quantitatively different? We know that many things can cause chronic fatigue, and this is probably true for the chronic fatigue syndrome, too. We can anticipate that discrete causes of the chronic fatigue syndrome will be found in the future, even if these causes are unlikely to fall neatly along the physical–psychological divide that some expect. The causes of chronic fatigue are undoubtedly many, both in a population and in any individual person, even when a discrete cause, such as depression or cancer, is identified. Social, behavioral, and psychological variables are important in both chronic fatigue and the chronic fatigue syndrome. Interventions that address these general variables can be successful, and currently they are often more successful than interventions directed at specific causes.",

      "abstract": "Stress defines a cluster of psychophysiological responses aimed at enabling resources to solve difficult situations, as well as restoring and maintaining homeostasis in the body. Stress is a combination of physiological, neuroendocrine, behavioural and emotional responses to new or threatening stimuli and serves as a protective adaptation of the body under physiological conditions. In accordance with the effect on the body, beneficial and negative stress is distinguished. Stress can be divided into “chronic” and “acute”. The intensity of the physiological response to a stressor is highly individual and situationally dependent. Many variables, including personal attributes, coping strategies, social support, and past experiences may modify the physiological stress response in any given situation and can account for the different response of people exposed to the same stressor. Intense and persistent stress can lead to psychological and pathological body injury. Stress has a significant impact on different brain regions, including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, amygdala etc. Depression, anxiety, cognitive deficits, and even stress-induced mental diseases are closely related to functional and structural damage of the related brain regions. Repetitive daily acute stress can be associated with different diseases, first of all cardiovascular diseases, which affect quality of life and can cut short life expectancy. Timely treatment is required to prevent progression of early stress reactions to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in individuals at high risk. Advanced stress and anxiety management interventions include non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments.",

      "title": "Guidelines in the management of diabetic nerve pain clinical utility of pregabalin",
      "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes. It presents as a variety of syndromes for which there is no universally accepted unique classification. Sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common type, affecting about 30% of diabetic patients in hospital care and 25% of those in the community. Pain is the reason for 40% of patient visits in a primary care setting, and about 20% of these have had pain for greater than 6 months. Chronic pain may be nociceptive, which occurs as a result of disease or damage to tissue with no abnormality in the nervous system. In contrast, neuropathic pain is defined as \"pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.\" Persistent neuropathic pain interferes significantly with quality of life, impairing sleep and recreation; it also significantly impacts emotional well-being, and is associated with depression, anxiety, and noncompliance with treatment. Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a difficult-to-manage clinical problem, and patients with this condition are more apt to seek medical attention than those with other types of diabetic neuropathy. Early recognition of psychological problems is critical to the management of pain, and physicians need to go beyond the management of pain per se if they are to achieve success. This evidence-based review of the assessment of the patient with pain in diabetes addresses the state-of-the-art management of pain, recognizing all the conditions that produce pain in diabetes and the evidence in support of a variety of treatments currently available. A search of the full Medline database for the last 10 years was conducted in August 2012 using the terms painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy and pain in diabetes. In addition, recent reviews addressing this issue were adopted as necessary. In particular, reports from the American Academy of Neurology and the Toronto Consensus Panel on Diabetic Neuropathy were included. Unfortunately, the results of evidence-based studies do not necessarily take into account the presence of comorbidities, the cost of treatment, or the role of third-party payers in decision-making. Thus, this review attempts to give a more balanced view of the management of pain in the diabetic patient with neuropathy and in particular the role of pregabalin.",

Impact loads can either exert their effect with direct contact to the tissue or may cause inertial loads. The direct contact can cause deformation of the skull or induce energy stress waves to the head and brain. All of these events will result in tissue strain due to compression, tension, or shear.

Psychological stress has a negative impact over physical, mental and social well-being of a person. It has been suggested to play an important role in causation or precipitation of multitude of medical and dental problems ranging from serious heart diseases, cancers, gastrointestinal diseases, to common headaches, migraine, recurrent oral ulcerations, burning and dry mouth. In order to better understand the role of stress, valid and reliable measurement of stress is of utmost importance. Since, most of methods used for the diagnosis of stress are questionnaires form (subjective methods) which depend on person and there is many inter individual variation between subjects, thus there is increased need of biological stress markers to provide an objective, reliable and authentic evidence of stress. Self-reporting subjective questionnaire forms in stress evaluation and as psychological diagnostic mean provide highly inconsistent results according to patient’s mood and attitude. And this is because many individuals suffering from stress related problems have a tendency to either negate or exaggerate the real condition; which may lead to a deviation in the study and discompose the results. Thus there is a high need for studying the changes caused by stress in the human body to evaluate the usefulness of the bio physiological indicators or biomarkers to provide a reliable objective evaluation and assessment of a stress and psychologically related conditions. Salivary biomarkers are one of most widely researched area of interest because it might to provide a reliable, noninvasive and objective measurements of the response of the body, also because of easy and rapid collection of samples compared to the blood and urine samples thereby increasing the patient compliance. Many biomarkers have been used in determination of stress such as cortisol levels, immunoglobulins, cardiovascular parameters.

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

This was a case report about a 30 year old male from a rural area who presented with the complaints of being self absorbent, slothful, reluctant with self-laughing, self-muttering and odd behavior, having little interest in emotional reaction with poor social interactions and no interest in earning or pleasurable activities. On mental state examination his mood was found to be euthymic with restricted affect; decreased rate and rhythm of speech with impairment of judgement, abstract and insight. Other medical causes of such conditions were excluded. In addition to pharmacological treatment, psychological interventions were exercised and considerable improvement was noticed.

Simply defined, it is intellectual disintegration. The manifestations of dementia vary considerably, reflecting the mental, social, and emotional resources of a person before his illness began. Unfortunately, it often strikes the individual at the height of his productivity. The first symptom of the condition may be a decrease in expected level of functioning, and thus the disease may be very closely tied to the patient's work or professional status. It is important to note that the symptoms that usher in the process of dementia differ little from those that occur in normal people who are exhausted, anxious, or under severe pressure.

Survivors often face lifelong impairments affecting functional status, cognition, and mood. Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

Studies of this problem explicitly show that the loss of the job exerts a detrimental health effect. A number of other factors decide about the significance of this relationship. The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

The predisposing basis for functional dysphonia can lie in the constitution of an individual, his/her professional speaking and speech behavior and/or may be personality-based.

The interaction of predisposed and causal factors is unknown. Stress, overall fatigue, anxiety, depression and/or certain personality traits (which complicate or hamper coping) are considered as perpetuating factors. In any case, overlaps between voice symptoms and reactive psychic as well as social problems have to be kept in mind (e. g. the burden of suffering, depressive processing, speaking anxiety, socially withdrawal). Because the association of multiple psychosocial factors with functional dysphonia is not distinct--such are always existent in organ medically unexplained symptoms--functional dysphonia has to be diagnostically differentiated. For the purpose of the article, a psycho-diagnostic path following the ICD-10 chapter V along general lines is presented.

This study used data from the authors' clinical department to retrospectively investigate the clinical characteristics of sport-related concussion and factors associated with delays in examinations.The study included 38 patients with sport-related concussions who were treated at the authors' hospital. The sports during which the injuries occurred, occasions of injury, factors affecting the time from injury until examination at hospital, and prognoses were evaluated retrospectively.Sport-related concussions most frequently occurred in rugby and judo, where tackling, throwing, and other types of physical contact can result in impacts to the head region at high angular or linear velocity with acceleration. Some subjects showed consciousness disturbance and/or clear subjective symptoms immediately after the injury and were therefore examined at the hospital rapidly. However, other subjects who suffered amnesia or less obvious symptoms continued to play after the injury and had delayed examinations. In addition, there was a tendency for examinations to be delayed when an on-site physician was present.In contact sports where injury-resulting events occur, such as impacts to the head at high angular or linear velocity with acceleration, athletes should be immediately withdrawn from play and evaluated for concussion, even if there are no obvious head injuries or symptoms. The immediate ascertainment of symptoms after physical contact would improve the rapid detection of sport-related concussion.",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

Back pain symptoms range from the simple backache, which most people have at some time in their lifetime, to serious spinal diseases and lower back disabilities. While back pain may have several causes, a large percentage of patients are diagnosed with nonspecific acute back pain with no proof of any major structural disease. As in many areas of malingering, objective diagnostic testing proving causation and supporting symptomatology is all but impossible. Notably, the history in the malingering patient may be either consistent or inconsistent. Physical examination findings to look for in a malingerer center on consistency of effort and compliance.",

Some individuals continue to have symptoms for 3 to 6 months; a subset experience problems even after 1 year. It is hypothesized that subtle diffuse axonal injury may contribute to persistent symptoms in some individuals. In all cases, the trauma experience has personal meaning for the person affected, and significant psychological reactions are common. Adaptive biological reactions occur in the postinjury period.

The canonical phenotype of the Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executive and visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing the cognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition, recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it more and more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathology may support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is very likely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow common patterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share a prion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

      "abstract": "SummaryProlonged fatigue is a common complaint in the community and is usually transitory. If fatigue continues for more than six months, is disabling, and is accompanied by other constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms, then a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) should be considered.CFS probably is an heterogeneous disease, maybe multifactorial, or it includes different pathologies which manifest with the same symptoms. In some cases, the mode of presentation of the illness implicate the exposure to chemical and/or food toxins as precipitating factors (e.g., ciguatera poisoning, Gulf War Syndrome, etc.). In other CFS cases, the etiology is still unknown: there are various hypotheses on pathogenetic events which, alone or in association with each other, may precipitate the illness. In fact, it is probable an involvement of multiple events in CFS onset where different precipitating factors can interact each other, even if not always all present in the single patient: latent and/or chronic viral infections, immunologic and neuroendocrine dysfunctions, psychological, environmental and mood factors.In accordance to this theory, we consider various subgroups of CFS patients on the basis of the pathway and the mode of presentation of the disease. The Clinic of Infectious Diseases of \"G. D'Annunzio\" University of Chieti is one of the main National Reference Centers for the CFS Study in Italy. From January 1992 to January 1998, 238 patients came to our observation: 89 of them met CDC criteria for CFS (1994), 127 did not; the other 22 patients are still under evaluation. Our patients underwent physical examination (including tests for searching for the possible coexistence of a fibromyalgia syndrome), psychiatric interview with several neuropsychological tests, laboratory tests (including magnesium determination on serum), neuroendocrine evaluation (circadian rhythm of several hormones, buspirone challenge test), SPECT scans to evaluate cerebral perfusion, and other examinations where necessary in according to the symptomatology of each patient (e.g., orthopedic, ORL, EMG, muscle biopsy, etc.).According to our preliminary results, we subdivided our patients in different subgroups and we studied them comparatively.We report the more significant data collected from this evaluation that might lead to a better understanding of the syndrome and in particular of its pathways course, a knowledge that will help in choosing appropriate therapies for each subgroups.",

One type of self-reported posttraumatic illness known as chemosensory dysfunction occurs in as many as 24.5% of head trauma victims. Ferreting out individuals pretending to have chemosensory dysfunction as part of litigation for economic gain is a clinical dilemma requiring a multimodal approach. This includes evaluation of historical context, complaints, physical examination findings, chemosensory testing, psychiatric evaluation, and ancillary testing. Long-standing chemosensory complaints seemingly produce or exacerbate psychiatric problems in various ways. As chemosensory problems persist over time, patients may become pessimistic about an eventual recovery and this may lead to depression. Historical clues indicating malingering also include complaints of trauma-induced absolute loss of chemosensory ability. Consistent with his physical findings, both first taste and temporal summation indicate problems within the chemosensory system.",

      "title": "Bruxism Decoded: A Case Report Revealing the Invisible Signs",
      "abstract": "Bruxism is characterized by involuntary movements involving teeth grinding or clenching. It is perceived as a parafunctional activity, and it can lead to instability and various consequences such as dental wear, musculoskeletal pain, masseter hypertrophy, persistent fatigue, and tension headaches. According to the time of occurrence, it can be classified as awake bruxism and/or sleep bruxism. This case report describes a 19-year-old woman, who presented to her family doctor with shoulder pain, headaches, and persistent tiredness despite apparent adequate sleep. She reported no other symptoms and denied any trauma or physical exertion. Her past medical history included anxiety disorder, treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and irregular follow-ups with psychology and psychiatry throughout the years. The only relevant findings on the physical examination were cervical and shoulder tenderness, without functional impairment, along with noticeable wear on dental surfaces, consistent with bruxism. Further history of overall behaviour was compatible with both sleep and awake bruxism, exacerbated during periods of increased anxiety. The SSRI dose was increased, and a muscle relaxant was prescribed. A referral was made to both psychology and dentistry. After two weeks, a reduction in anxiety, headaches, and musculoskeletal pain was observed, with only sporadic use of the muscle relaxant. A dental splint was prescribed following dental evaluation, resulting in significant clinical improvement: better anxiety control, improved sleep quality, occasional musculoskeletal complaints, and reduced headaches. Although the patient did not initially complain of bruxism, the presence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity with repetitive contractions and increased muscle tension highlighted the need to identify this condition as a clinical target for intervention and treatment. Early diagnosis is essential to minimize complications and prevent symptom dispersion. Otherwise, bruxism may be overlooked as a central diagnosis, and treatment opportunities may be missed. Given its multifactorial aetiology, management must be multidisciplinary, as demonstrated in this case.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in community settings and in primary and secondary care. Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many of those who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms which are seen in all anxiety disorders, and diagnosis rests on the identification of the particular anxiety disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of coexisting depressive symptoms and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or undergoing individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, and for this reason it is helpful to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence-base for each anxiety disorder.",

The 1970s witnessed an \"epidemic\" of dissociative disorder, particularly DID, which may have reflected enthusiasm for the diagnosis more than its actual prevalence. Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

Comorbidity describes the effect of all other conditions an individual patient might have other than the primary condition of interest, and can be physiological or psychological. In the context of mental health, comorbidity often refers to disorders that are often coexistent with each other, such as depression and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously, but independently with another condition or a related derivative medical condition. The latter sense of the term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which coronary artery disease is an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence.

When grief becomes particularly distressing or prolonged, individuals can experience complicated grief, which is tied to more negative grief outcomes.

      "title": "Depressive Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy is most often used to treat disorders of mood. The internally experienced feeling is the emotional state reflected in the way we present ourselves to others and in the ways we react to them. Mood varies with daily circumstances and is sensitive to the conditions of the body, particularly physical health, fatigue, hunger, and hormonal activity. Moods are experienced internally and fluctuate widely. Two disorders are recognized. Depression, or depressive mood disorder, is dominated by sadness, hopelessness, fear of the future, and the persistent thought that life is not worth living. Mania, or manic mood disorder, is a state of excitement, grandiosity, expansiveness, and feelings of increased power and energy. In the present psychiatric classification, mania is labeled bipolar disorder and the depressed phase is labeled major depression. In a depressive mood disorder, body functions are disrupted. Patients are sleepless, appetite is poor, and weight loss may be pronounced, at times amounting to 20% of the body weight within a few weeks. Work, sexual activity, and family may be disregarded. The future appears hopeless, patients believe they are helpless to affect it, and their thoughts are filled with gloom. Threats of suicide reflect their distress. They are often agitated and restless. Many meet the criteria for the malignant syndrome of melancholia. Overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, the depressed patient dwells on thoughts of suicide. He may believe that others are watching or talking about him; voices are heard when no one is present; and concerns that his spouse is unfaithful dominate his thought. At times, the events depicted on the television or movie screen seem to apply directly to him. Such strange thoughts are delusions, and this severe state of depressed mood and disorder in thought is labeled delusional depression or psychotic depression. These disorders require intensive treatment and almost always hospital care. A depressed patient is commonly unaware of the day’s events, registers little of what happens around her, and has a compromised memory. This form of depression can be difficult to distinguish from an Alzheimer-type dementia. When the symptoms of dementia are brought about by depression, however, they can be reversed with treatment.",

It is also the case of vertebromedular traumas associated with other post-traumatic lesions, where the neurological signal is distorted, and may induce particularities of associated lesions. Posttraumatic spinal shock, autonomic dysreflexia and motor, sensory and autonomous after effects, bring distortions of the neurogenic signal, which will significantly affect other traumatized territories, generating clinical manifestations and atypical reaction elements.

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

Fatigue has been variously hypothesized to be caused by dysfunction of the striato-thalamo-cortical loop, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter abnormalities within the central nervous system. However, there is no firm evidence that any of these proposed etiologies explain the fatigue experienced by patients who have PD or other diseases. Fatigue may be associated with depression, sleep disorders, and medication-induced adverse effects, but it also remains a distinct symptom that can occur independently from these other disorders and problems. Fatigue is a persistent symptom in individual patients, and it is unrelated to disease severity. Fatigue is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. Several questionnaires are available to measure fatigue, but many of these are disease-specific and do not apply to patients who have PD. Some questionnaires measure general overall fatigue, whereas others measure different aspects of fatigue, including mental, physical, emotional, motivational, and exertional fatigue. Often fatigue is confused with sleepiness, a related but distinct construct. Clearly, fatigue has a significantly negative impact on the quality of life and physical function of patients with PD. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for this problematic nonmotor symptom of PD. Additional research is needed to provide a better understanding of this complex problem.",

A number of other psychiatric disorders e.g. bipolar disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and some other anxiety disorders, antisocial and borderline personality, co-occur with substance-use disorders and may account for some of the association between depression and substance abuse.

      "title": "The Fluid Retention Syndrome: Recognition, Risk Factors and Management",
      "abstract": "A complaint of bloating or swelling of sufficient severity to lead to medical consultation is the lead symptom of a syndrome (the fluid retention syndrome) which includes affective, somatic and autonomic symptoms. These appear to have a primary origin in a neuroendocrine disturbance of limbic and hypothalamic function and form a substantial part of the work-load of a menopause clinic. The fluid retention syndrome, in turn, is one component of a spectrum of affective-somatic-autonomic disorders which comprise a significant part of the general practitioner's work load. Major risk factors for the fluid retention syndrome comprise a strong family history of swelling symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, affective illness, including major life events, weight gain and obesity. Short term exacerbations of swelling are precipitated by emotional stress, high carbohydrate meals, alcohol, prolonged standing and exercise, high ambient temperatures and rebound oedema following the withdrawal of diuretic therapy. Management involves recognition of the syndrome, a clear explanation of its nature to the patient, the control of weight-related fluid retention by reduction to a pre-morbid target weight and the avoidance of inappropriate drug therapy. In particular, diuretics should not be prescribed for fluid-retaining symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be prescribed for patients with the fluid retention syndrome if there is biochemical evidence of ovarian failure. The role of HRT in inducing rapid bloating independently of weight gain requires evaluation by a randomised controlled clinical trial. More effective management of the syndrome awaits further understanding of the neuroendocrine substrate for the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a disabling, multifaceted symptom that is highly prevalent and stubbornly persistent. Although fatigue is a frequent complaint among patients with fibromyalgia, it has not received the same attention as pain. Reasons for this include lack of standardized nomenclature to communicate about fatigue, lack of evidence-based guidelines for fatigue assessment, and a deficiency in effective treatment strategies. Fatigue does not occur in isolation; rather, it is present concurrently in varying severity with other fibromyalgia symptoms such as chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, anxiety, depression, cognitive difficulties, and so on. Survey-based and preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that multiple symptoms feed into fatigue and it may be associated with a variety of physiological mechanisms. Therefore, fatigue assessment in clinical and research settings must consider this multi-dimensionality. While no clinical trial to date has specifically targeted fatigue, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses indicate that treatment modalities studied in the context of other fibromyalgia symptoms could also improve fatigue. The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Fibromyalgia Working Group and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) have been instrumental in propelling the study of fatigue in fibromyalgia to the forefront. The ongoing efforts by PROMIS to develop a brief fibromyalgia-specific fatigue measure for use in clinical and research settings will help define fatigue, allow for better assessment, and advance our understanding of fatigue.",

      "abstract": "Stress is one of the most significant and widespread medical and social problems in the world and it is the etiological factor in 80% of diseases. In the modern world any person is subject to the influence of stress, regardless of the age and gender differences, culture and social status. Stress is a non-specific reaction of the body to the extreme impact of various factors - stressors. As stressors can be: emotional, social, physical, informational and other factors. In functional and morphological terms, stress is manifests itself as a general adaptation syndrome which mobilizes the body’s resources in order to maintain homeostasis. Stress is characterized by staging. The early period of stress is manifested by transient anxiety, with a decrease in body resistance – it is the first stage of the adaptation syndrome. The second stage of stress is characterized by the functional tension of the body’s systems and adaptation to new conditions. In the case of prolonged stress, the body’s reaction becomes pathological, with the depletion of adaptive reserves and the failure of protective mechanisms. At this stage is increase a vulnerability to any stressors. There is a further violation of the consistency of vital functions, and persistent anxiety is formed. In overwhelming majority of cases, stress-induced anxiety is develop of psychovegetative syndrome. In the case when combined the strategies of coping (it is the second stage of the reaction to stress - the stage of resistance) with stress and if it is interrupted at an early stage, in such a way the somatic symptoms are also interrupted at the stage of autonomic dystonia syndrome. When the persistent stress is, we have a development of the third stage – exhaustion. And against the background of limited adaptive reactions, there is a psychosomatic pathology. The above determines the need for early detection of psychovegetative syndrome and its timely treatment. The optimal choice is the appointment of combined drugs for stress, which have anti-anxiety, sedative and hypnotic effects. The combination of phenobarbital and ethylbromisovalerinate is one of the highly effective and widely used for the relief of stressinduced anxiety and manifestations of autonomic dysfunction, reducing the risk of developing psychosomatic pathology.",

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a complex psychiatric disorder that occurs since the beginning of the civilization, but only to be defined about thirty years ago. Post-traumatic stress disorder, like many other psychiatric disorders, affects not only the patient but also his family and his wider social surroundings. Over the time, the symptoms of the disorder progress and the disorder itself becomes chronic. Consequently, the patient’s ability to function in everyday life and work environment drops, and it only shows how important the early detection, treatment and prevention are for a patient. Post-traumatic stress disorder treatments involve pharmacotherapy, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and other psychotherapies. The role of a nurse covers a wide spectrum of necessary abilities, when it comes to patients who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

The clinical differentiation between functional and organic disease is at times difficult to establish, because, presumptively, in the beginning, at least, all organic disease is preceded by a physiologic perversion, that is, functional alteration, which may or may not be apparent with our present diagnostic limitations.

We also have evidence-based studies that depression for example is an independent risk factor of heart infarct onset. On the other hand, we observe the somatization of clinical picture of mental disorders, the increase of atypical forms manifesting through pain or other somatic syndromes that leads to the increase of mental illnesses in the primary care. The research of common pathways of mental and somatic pathology should be the subject of further interdisciplinary research programs. The other issue is the patient's compliance that plays in important role in the success of every kind of treatment. Personality traits and status of mental health can influence ones attitude to illness as well as motivation to therapy.

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

Originally the behavior of a child was pronounced postencephalitic when the following three conditions were fulfilled: (1) a sudden change in personality, (2) physical evidence of postencephalitis and (3) a history of acute epidemic encephalitis.

Among the causes of depression it is necesary to consider genetic, psychological, and enviromental factors, distinguishing between factors of predisposition or vulnerability and leading factors. With regards to the clinical repercussions, it is necesary to emphasize the difficulty in carrying out a diagnosis, since often it in a masked form. In spite of this, depression in old age is accompanied with a typical sympthomatology, among which is distinguished motivational, cognitive, mood, and organic symtphoms.

      "title": "Stress-Related Immune Markers in Depression: Implications for Treatment",
      "abstract": "Major depression is a serious psychiatric disorder; however, the precise biological basis of depression still remains elusive. A large body of evidence implicates a dysregulated endocrine and inflammatory response system in the pathogenesis of depression. Despite this, given the heterogeneity of depression, not all depressed patients exhibit dysregulation of the inflammatory and endocrine systems. Evidence suggests that inflammation is associated with depression in certain subgroups of patients and that those who have experienced stressful life events such as childhood trauma or bereavement may be at greater risk of developing depression. Consequently, prolonged exposure to stress is thought to be a key trigger for the onset of a depressive episode. This review assesses the relationship between stress and the immune system, with a particular interest in the mechanisms by which stress impacts immune function, and how altered immune functioning, in turn, may lead to a feed forward cascade of multiple systems dysregulation and the subsequent manifestation of depressive symptomology. The identification of stress-related immune markers and potential avenues for advances in therapeutic intervention is vital. Changes in specific biological markers may be used to characterize or differentiate depressive subtypes or specific symptoms and may predict treatment response, in turn facilitating a more effective, targeted, and fast-acting approach to treatment.",

      "abstract": "The capacity of adopting an orthostatic posture is, undoubtedly, a milestone in the evolution of the human species and has motivated extensive research in the physiological and anthropological areas. The physiological mechanisms involved in adopting and maintaining an orthostatic posture and its complications have been investigated through the centuries. The anatomists do not consider the postural adaptation of the human being a peculiar transformation that occurred to mankind, but the culmination of a series of evolutionary phases that might have started in the body of the primate ancestors 1 . It is believed that the human cardiovascular system is adapted to maintain cerebral perfusion during the orthostatic posture. Although the gravitational force creates a gradient of pressure at the level of the circulatory system, the human being is capable of maintaining an upright posture because the gravitational pressure is partially neutralized by mechanisms that prevent the accumulation of flin the lower limbs 2 . Despite that, syncope, defi ned as a transient loss of consciousness and postural tonus due to cerebral hypoperfusion, has a considerable medical, social and economical impact. This clinical syndrome can be the consequence of not only refl ex mechanisms3, but also a clinical manifestation of a broad range of distinct clinical conditions 4 . A perspective of the cardiovascular adaptation to orthostatism is presented herein, in an attempt to assess evolutionary and physiological issues regarding the maintenance of circulatory homeostasis during orthostasis, stressing the role of the great arteries.",

      "abstract": "Gay and Abbott introduced the term in 1953 to describe the mechanism of cervical trauma, originating usually after a rear-end automobile collision, which produced no obvious direct head injury nor loss of consciousness. The condition has been frequently described and thoroughly documented from the anatomical, surgical and medico-legal aspects, many orthopedic surgeons preferring to call the entity acute traumatic cervical Interestingly enough, most histories given are strikingly similar as far as symptoms go, whether the agent is a traumatic acceleration-deceleration experience or a crick in the neck due to a fall. Following the accident, patients complain of headache, pain and discomfort in the neck, nausea, dizziness, tinnitus and inability to concentrate. Physical exam reveals no gross abnormalities; but ocular symptoms may be prominent within a few hours: extreme fatigue, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia and reading difficulties. Anxiety and varying degree of depression soon follow. It has been customary to attribute many of these symptoms of cervical trauma to psychoneurosis and to dismiss the patient's complaints as evidence of psychic inadequacies. This attitude has been especially evident in cases in which ocular changes followed whiplash. In our experience, a malingerer may occasionally be encountered, but as a rule, we deal with the hyper-responsive, tense and emotional individual, not hard to identify by means of a detailed history, asking the proper questions and above all, by thorough examination. I report a case series of 16 patients. Their ocular manifestations of whiplash injuries were amaurotic episodes, decreased accommodation and convergence, decreased prism vergence power, anisocoria, diplopia, light sensitivity, extraocular muscle imbalances, ptosis, possible vitreous detachment, tearing. Management and prognosis are considered as well as the role of pathogenetic factors in the production of the syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a common complaint among patients presenting to family physicians. Diagnosis begins with a patient history distinguishing weakness from fatigue or asthenia, separate conditions with different etiologies that can coexist with, or be confused for, weakness. The pattern and severity of weakness, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history help the physician determine whether the cause of a patient's weakness is infectious, neurologic, endocrine, inflammatory, rheumatologic, genetic, metabolic, electrolyte-induced, or drug-induced. In the physical examination, the physician should objectively document the patient's loss of strength, conduct a neurologic survey, and search for patterns of weakness and extramuscular involvement. If a specific cause of weakness is suspected, the appropriate laboratory or radiologic studies should be performed. Otherwise, electromyography is indicated to confirm the presence of a myopathy or to evaluate for a neuropathy or a disease of the neuromuscular junction. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the examiner should pursue a tiered progression of laboratory studies. Physicians should begin with blood chemistries and a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay to evaluate for electrolyte and endocrine causes, then progress to creatine kinase level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody assays to evaluate for rheumatologic, inflammatory, genetic, and metabolic causes. Finally, many myopathies require a biopsy for diagnosis. Pathologic evaluation of the muscle tissue specimen focuses on histologic, histochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical, and genetic analyses; advances in technique have made a definitive diagnosis possible for many myopathies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The fatigue that arises from work manifests itself as a feeling of constant fatigue or weakness. It can be physical, mental, or a combination of both. The occurrence of fatigue is influenced by physical, mental and sensory loads, night work, psychological and physical factors of the working environment, personality characteristics of the worker. In order to speak with certainty about the impact of work on humans, one must determine precisely in each particular case what type of work it is. In this sense, the difference is made whether it is static or dynamic work. If the factors such as physical and psychological load act longer than the worker can tolerate, there is a psychophysiological overstretchand a state between normal physiological and pathological with a tendency to pass into the pathological form, i.e. disease. Acute and chronic fatigue of health care workers is very common. Given that every healthcare professional during his working life meets with numerous hazards and dangers, it is very important that they are recognized in a certain way, evaluated / ranked in order to pay special attention to these hazards and dangers that represent a potential threat to the safety and health of health workers. In this context, a study of health workers currently employed in the Kotor Health Center, Emergency Medical Service and Kotor General Hospital was conducted with the aim of establishing the connection between acute and chronic fatigue among medical workers with sociodemographic work and life characteristics of respondents. As for the methods in the process of collecting data from the respondents, two questionnaires were used, which the respondents themselves completed the OFER15 questionnaire and the general questionnaire. Based on the analysis of the data, it can be concluded that recovery, acute and chronic fatigue are significantly higher among the hospital medical workers, which corresponds to the number of working hours that is higher compared to the other population that was examined.",

      "abstract": "A possible cause for the persistence of symptoms following an injury to the back is put forward, together with a suggestion relating the psychiatric symptoms frequently seen in these cases to the initial injury. A depressive reaction as a primary result of the injury to the cervical spine is postulated, rather than as a result of failure of treatment or of persistent pain. The concept of litigation neurosis and the present state of medical evidence and attitudes toward a “functional overlay” are discussed in the light of this concept of depressive reaction after injury. This brings up a difference in evidence and attitude toward psychiatric disability in workers’ compensation law, since, as the Act at present differentiates between psychiatric conditions arising from the accident and those which result from pain and suffering occurring after a known physical disability, the present concept brings depression in an anxious individual into more direct relationship to the initial injury. The problems of anxiety in relation to litigation, and the effect of this on the efficiency of treatment of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic neurosis, are mentioned, and further work on this subject with particular reference to the immigrant population will be presented in a further paper. A follow-up study is needed to determine the mechanism of “cure” after settlement of insurance claims.",

Admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute disease carries a high level of stress for families, as the disease is of sudden onset and is life-threatening. The incidence of PTSD (21%) was significant among parents well after their child was discharged from the PICU. Symptoms of PTSD include reexperiencing the traumatic event through recurrent, intrusive recollections, repetitive play, or distressing dreams; avoidance of associations with the event through restricted affect and feelings of detachment; and hyperarousal symptoms such as sleep difficulties, poor concentration, irritability, aggression, and physiological reactivity to trauma-related events. In addition to general hyperarousal symptoms, children may complain of stomachaches and headaches. There have been many summaries and reviews of research published regarding the effects of hospitalization with these children. Findings indicate that the experience is, indeed, stressful and that children may experience fear phenomena, regression, sadness, separation anxiety, withdrawal, sleep disturbances, and aggressive behaviors. There was a positive correlation between PTSD symptoms in parents and PTSD symptoms in the child, length of admission and perceived threat of illness to the child’s life. In PICU admissions cause greater disruption to a child’s life, with longer admissions, greater time off school and more paediatric out-patient contacts and hospital re-admissions in the 6–12 months after discharge.",

The stigma given by society related to people who have a mental disorder is very diverse, ranging from so-called insane, people who do not have reason, and so on, but the highlight in this study is the stigma from society against people affected by mental disorders is the stigma that those who experience depression or other mental disorders that they lack faith, lack of prayer, lack of belief in God, and various other stigmas, this is then exacerbated by \"religious figures\" who sometimes give the same stigma and do not provide solutions to what is being felt by people who are affected by mental disorders.

It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "DURING the past fifty or sixty years it has bcen customary to regard errors of refraction as the cause of many symptoms of ill-health.Headache, tics, insomnia, inability to concentrate attention, photophobia, flushing and watering of the eyes, neuralgia, anorexia, constipation, anaemia, mental dullness, sleepiness and languor, squint, migraine, hysteria in many of its forms, are but a few of the troubles attributed directly or indirectly in modern English text-books to eye-strain.Some American ophthalmologists have been even more extravagant in their views, and claim t o have cured scores of other ills by means of glasses.The mental and emotional state of the patient has not been considered, and the possibility of this state determining the eye symptom instead of the eye condition causing the general manifestations appears to have eluded both oculist and physician.It is the object of this paper to show that the eye rarely produces other than ocular symptoms, unless the patient is emotionally unstable, and that he frequently is relieved, not by glasses, but by suggestion or else by some adjustment of the inner life usually unknown t o the oculist.Headache is the most common symptom for which patients seek relief from the ophthalmic surgeon.There are scores of thousands of people in this country alone who are wearing glasses, not for the purpose of seeing better, but solely to relieve headaches.I n America, I believe, the practice is much more common.In France, on the contrary, it is rare.Are we to assume that the French suffer less from a given degree of eye-strain, and the Americans more?It must be remembered that the correction of errors of refraction is a modern invention.Astigmativni was hardly known, even by the medical profession, fifty years ago, and a hundred years ago probably no one wore glasses, except for old sight and pronounced degrees of hypermetropia and myopia.It is true that reading in those days, a t any rate as we understand reading now, was rarely indulged in, but many occupations needed close attention t o detail.Modern machinery, such as the sewing machine, has relieved the eyes of a great deal of strain.Either a large proportion of our forefathers suffered from chronic headache, or they were of a different breed from their",

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

As a rule, late-life depression afflicts medically ill, disabled persons living under chronic stress and/or isolation. Symptoms and signs of medical illnesses and behavioral limitations from disability are often difficult to distinguish from depressive symptomatology. Under-reporting of depressed mood and other psychological symptoms is common by older adults and contributes to under-diagnosis of depression. Many antidepressant drugs and some psychotherapies have been found more efficacious than their respective comparison conditions. However, each of these treatments helps less than half of depressed older adults, necessitating a treatment strategy in which failure or intolerance of each treatment step informs the next. Clinical subpopulations of late-life depression — psychotic depression, dysthymic disorder, depression associated with an adverse life event, treatment-resistant depression, and residual symptoms of depression — require special attention.",

      "abstract": "The word depression is being used to describe both a symptom and an illness.The symptom is the experience of gloom, despondency, sadness, grief; the feeling of being run down, dispirited, miserable, melancholic, in the dumps, or of being low.The richness of our language in synonyms for depression may be taken as an indication of its frequency.It is an emotional experience, though sometimes it is described as an empti- ness or flatness, seemingly a loss rather than a lowering of affect.Depression, like anxiety, is a universal experience, and we regard it as abnormal only if it appears without reason or if it seems excessive in its degree or duration in relation to the pro- vocation.Not surprisingly such a common feeling may be associated with any psychiatric syndrome; the depressive dis- orders are those in which the depressed affect appears to be the primary phenomenon or at any rate one of the more prominent of the clinical features.Broadly there are two depressive entities-endogenous depres- sion, which is a variant of manic-depressive illness, and neurotic depression.In practice the differentiation of these two condi- tions is often difficult, but this is not surprising when we recall that any primary psychiatric disturbance may be associated with secondary or reactive features, and of these depression is one of the more common.A convenient though over-simplified view that attempts to quantify this relationship suggests that in any individual case we can regard the patient a. showing say-to give an example-40% endogenous and 60% reactive or neurotic depression.If so, one should not forget that irre- spective of the magnitude of the figures it is the endogenous component that is important, for the remainder is a reaction to it.Successful treatment of the endogenous component is likely to lead to total recovery, whereas treatment directed only at the reactive component can hardly be more than partly successful.The term \" atypical depression \" has been applied to some of these cases.It is only in the last 10 or 15 years we have come to appre- ciate how common is depressive illness.Watts' estimated that in general practice one could expect that of every 1,000 patients 12 would present as revw cases each year.Older figures, largely hospital derived and therefore making little allowance for milder cases, suggest that the incidence of endogenous depression alone is 1% in males and 2% in females.It would be unwise to suggest that depressive illness has become more common in the last 10 years ; the much larger number of cases seen reflects the fact that we have learned to recognize its milder forms.

The first phase of the disease was accompanied by anxiety, restlessness, autonomic and vascular paroxysms, anorexia, insomnia and disturbances of other physiological functions. Subsequently dysphoric mood, somatic concerns, pseudoneurotic and neurotic syndromes appeared. The outcome of the disorders was either with slow practical recovery or with a relatively stable personality change in the form of weakened volition, a reduction of energy, and a narrowing of the 'zone of comfort' due to the impairment of homeostatic functions. Often hypochondriasis could develop on the background of such features. Dysthymia is viewed as a special entity which must not be included either in the group of neuroses or in the group of typical organic brain syndromes, or in the group of endogenous psychoses.",

It merits a separate designation because its etiology, pathogenesis, and life history are different from those of the schizophrenic syndrome. The family histories are also different, as are the psychological findings. The treatment response is so different that it merits urgent consideration.

Stress is defined and classified from different perspectives. Stress is a cause of tension and demand or an adaptive mechanism. Stress and the presentation of the first episode of depression are directly related, however when recurrences are present signifi cant stress loses strength among the factors that trigger it. Stressors, especially the psychosocial, are related to recurrences. Chief among these are internal and external stressors, and life events, role stress and annoyances of daily living, high demands and perfectionism. Failure to accomplish goals is another factor provoking crisis in the life cycle transition. Neuroticism and perfectionism, and dysfunctional attitudes lead to isolation and lack of social support. Dysfunctional cognitive schemes lead to erroneous information processing. Depression is a pattern of relationship failing to find adaptive ways of coping with life and conduct relationships, although there are new visions that consider it as an adaptive effort. Comorbidity can lead the recurrence of depression. It has been suggested that maladaptive cognitive patterns, in particular in interaction with stressors, could lead to poor results in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder comorbidity with personality disorder. These, regardless of the state of depression have been associated with high dysfunctional attitudes.",

      "abstract": "The presence of physical symptoms that do not correlate with a disease process are often frustrating to healthcare professionals, are difficult to diagnose and may consume an inordinate proportion of healthcare resources. However, proper and complete physical and psychological assessment and treatment is becoming increasingly possible and essential. Physical illness may occur concomitantly and sometimes as a result of psychological distress, which has displayed itself in a diagnosed mental illness. In other cases physical symptoms may be caused by unconscious dynamics, and the process becomes the primary presenting mental concern. In other cases the physical illness is part of a conscious process and motivated by the hope of gain. Differentiation between physical symptoms of unconscious and conscious origin is important in selecting the correct response. A manager must first of all be alert for physical symptoms that appear to be consciously motivated, as in a disorder called \"malingering.\" The essential feature of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation. Managers may inadvertently encourage malingering in the workplace by inappropriate responses to employees who present a physical complaint that is consciously motivated for gain. When the manager can recognize this phenomenon as malingering, appropriate managerial intervention can cause this behavior to be controlled and even eliminated and thus enhance productivity.",

      "abstract": "A person’s reaction to trauma depends on the traumatic situation itself, personality characteristics of the person exposed to trauma, and posttraumatic social environment. Stressor must be extreme event that is extremely dangerous or fatal nature, and which is outside normal human experience [1]. Studies investigating psychological consequences of military and civil trauma confirmed the correlation between the nature and intensity of trauma, previous traumatic experience, and psychological consequences. Stress causes the autonomic nervous system hyperactivity. If the stress is extreme or constant symptoms of hyperactivity, increased heart rate, increased respiration, sweating, muscle tension, insomnia and increased anxiety are becoming significant for the prolonging the symptoms of PTSD. Our cells are well adapted to exposure to a mild stress for a short time. In contrast there are potentially serious consequences of exposure to the prolonged stress[2]. Various damages arising from the war in Bosnia (1992 - 1995) are almost undetectable, and the consequences for the mental health of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina are long and painful. It is estimated that in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are 1.75 million people who have some stress-related mental disorders, of which 1 million in the Federation. PTSD may be represented by mutations that must be carried by many genes. There may even be epigenetic reasons for the disorder that have nothing to do with heritable mutations per se. Epigenetic means related to functional changes in the genome that can be regulated by external environmental events that do not involve alterations in the genetic code. One epigenetic mechanism is called “methylation,” a molecular process that affects the activity of a large percentage of genes. Epigenetic investigations say that methylation may be involved in the development of stress regulation in early life[3]. A number of longitudinal studies have looked at independent variables spanning the entire course of the illness. A 10-year follow-up study in Holocaust survivors clearly demonstrated decline in stress hormone levels for those patients in whom PTSD developed or in whom PTSD was chronic. No such decline was shown for those survivors who did not present with PTSD. Indeed, they showed a relative increase in hormone levels [4]. Hippocampal volume has also been studied (using the same types of experiments as the twin studies described previously). Hippocampal volume can be quite variable. It can change as a result of environmental exposure, duration of certain illnesses, and even the age of the subject. As noted, shrunken hippocampal volume has been shown in PTSD patients, but most of these are younger cohorts. When one examines PTSD in older cohorts, the differences in volume evaporate, and no linkage with disease is observed [5]. Microarray analysis is a powerful way to look at global gene expression profiles in tissues which can identify relevant molecular processes. On that way we have enough tools on hand to find the genes responsible for the disorder. Studying such genes can lead to creating effective treatments, including designing medications that are not only specific to the disorder but also specific to an individual’s experience with the disorder.",

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

      "title": "Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is often consulted in the general hospital to assess for underlying psychiatric contributions to a patient's physical symptoms. Such questions are typically prompted after a medical or neurological evaluation has not identified the etiology of the physical symptoms, if the symptoms are incompatible with or disproportionate to existing medical or neurological pathology, or if the patient is engaging in maladaptive health-related or interpersonal behaviors in the hospital. Provider countertransference in response to patients presenting with psychiatric disorders that feature somatic symptoms—as well as the maladaptive behaviors that may accompany these symptoms—can lead to provider distress or impact patient care and is a critical area for liaison interventions from the consulting psychiatrist. This chapter demonstrates the approach to the hospitalized patient whose physical symptoms may arise secondary to psychological processes or whose psychological response to medical symptoms gives rise to pathological distress, behaviors, and impairment. It highlights some of the psychological factors that may contribute to the experience of and response to somatic symptoms, as well as some of the challenging interpersonal dynamics that occur in the hospital setting. Clinical cases involving somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and factitious disorder present strategies for making complex diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and effectively engaging these patients in psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",

However, chronic pain often can produce depression, anxiety, and marital difficulties. Although physical examination and other studies, including x-ray studies, 3D-CT, electromyelograms (EMG), nerve conduction velocity studies and MRI in many cases may document an organic basis of chronic back pain, some organic syndromes defy definition by objective tests. This may be a greater problem for women, where physician prejudice can result in a significantly less extensive evaluation of their complaints of back pain. Also, any litigation may influence symptoms and the type of litigation may influence outcomes [8]. Therefore, there is a need to differentiate between “organic” and “functional” (negative physical and laboratory examination) back pain.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with cancer have multiple symptoms, which frequently co-occur. A nonrandom distribution of symptoms suggests a common mechanism. Symptom clusters (SCs) were considered part of various syndromes in the early years of medicine. The SC concept in clinical medicine is old. Symptom clusters were commonly described in the psychology/psychiatry and neurology literature. Symptom cluster may be defined either clinically or statistically. Statistically derived clusters can differ from clinically defined clusters. The clinical importance of statistically derived clusters is unclear. Pain-insomnia-fatigue and pain-depression-fatigue are commonly recognized clinical clusters. Nausea-vomiting and anxiety-depression are also statistically observed clusters. The longitudinal stability of clusters is unknown. Certain SCs, appear to have a greater adverse influence on outcomes (such as performance status and survival) than others. Comorbidities probably influence symptoms at different levels, but their effect on cancer clusters is unknown. Comprehensive symptom assessment is crucial to cluster identification. The potential use of the cluster concept to abbreviate symptom assessment tools needs validation. Symptom cluster can be disease and/or treatment related and may change as individuals undergo antitumor therapies. Polypharmacy in symptom management is frequent but could be minimized if 1 drug could be used to treat cluster symptoms. Symptom cluster appears to vary with the assessment tool, disease stage, symptom domain used to cluster, cluster methodology, and number of symptoms assessed. The validity and reliability of SCs need universally accepted statistical methods, assessment tools, and symptom domains. For now, nausea-vomiting is recognized as a consistent cluster across multiple studies. Pain-depression-fatigue and pain-insomnia-fatigue are also well recognized. Symptom clusters may help in cancer diagnosis, symptom management, and prognostication. However, the cluster method, reliability, and validity need to be established before assessment or treatment guidelines are established. Symptom clusters require further research before becoming part of routine medical symptom assessment and management.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised by: recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress; and compulsions, which are behaviours or mental acts aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of as a response to chronic sexual victimisation and considers what this means for services and service configurations, as well as the implications of acknowledging for policy responses in health and human service fields. Abstract: Traumatic events are those that overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. However, one particular type of is increasingly being recognised as a driver of many social and mental health problems in those affected by it. The repeated caused by ongoing sexual abuse that is prolonged, occurs in the developmental stages of a person's life, and is often perpetrated by an authority figure is now being more readily perceived as a causal feature of multiple social and mental health issues and the consequent need for human services. Although not officially recognised in diagnostic classification, the term complex trauma or complex post-traumatic stress describes a broad-ranging set of disorders, symptoms and social problems that are not captured by a limited diagnostic category of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People suffering need treatments that are multifaceted and varied to accommodate their particular range of symptoms. Isolated treatment of particular symptoms may only impact on one aspect of their needs and will not resolve the underlying issues that have created the problem. Key points: The mental health impacts of sexual victimisation are frequently acknowledged but there are specific and additional impacts where victims have suffered a particular type of abuse that is: interpersonal, commences at an age where emotional development is affected, is ongoing, chronic or features multiple types of abuse. Many researchers and practitioners in the fields of psychiatry, psychology and social work do not see the mental health diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as sufficient to capture these specific effects of multiple types of abuse and chronic victimisation. There have been calls for an additional category called complex PTSD or complex trauma. The impacts of symptomatology on victim/survivors can be a driver of need for many human services, including mental health, medical and substance abuse services as well as social services like housing and relationship services. Acknowledging an underlying basis of could enhance service delivery to the victim/survivor that may have multiple needs across services. It is important to acknowledge the link between ongoing sexual victimisation and in order to facilitate a cultural shift towards the connectedness of services and a person-centred approach to service use.",

Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

They may represent different areas of a spectrum of illness/condition and/or be part of a spectrum of illnesses/conditions. However, they share both these characteristics with many general medical diagnostic constructs. For spectrums of illness/condition this may be because there are no natural boundaries but that it is important or seems obvious to recognize different areas of the spectrum for reasons of clinical utility (such as different prognostic implications or treatments) or different clinical pictures. For spectrums of illnesses/conditions the reason for co-occurrence may be because different diagnostic constructs have similar causes/mechanisms. On the other hand, these problems of lack of boundaries are not present as commonly in general medical diagnostic constructs. Alternative mental health classifications do not have the same issues with co-occurrence. They may be more useful in research to discover reasons why co-occurrence of symptoms may occur but have pragmatic drawbacks for other classification functions.",

Drug addiction causes are multiple and include psychological, family, social and obviously biological factors (drug addicting potential). In to-day clinical practice, addiction to benzodiazepines or opioids prescribed for maintenance therapy and the newly described secondary addiction of later onset are predominant. Severe social consequences and many psychiatric and medical disorders in particular due to HIV infection also result from drug addiction.

Feelings of ambivalence towards pregnancy, a distorted perception of reality, the unconscious refusing of a wanted child and the worry about a relation between nutrition of the foetus and the HG have influence on the development of the HG. The role of the social context, especially the mother, of expectations towards vomiting and of secondary gain in the genesis and the evaluation of HG is explained. Therapeutical approaches beside the known somatic therapies are acupuncture, the electric stimulation of the N. vestibularis and different methods of psychotherapy, which can include the partner or other persons from the social context. In some cases an intensified therapy under in-patient conditions can improve therapeutic results.Psychosocial factors are involved not only in the genesis of HG, but also in the duration and intensity of symptoms as well as in the resistance especially, towards isolated somatic therapeutical approaches.When psychosocial factors are taken into account in the search for a cause and the treatment of HG results of treatment are more successful and persist over a longer time.",

      "abstract": "The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as a severe anxiety disorder that develops after exposure to an event with actual, threatened, or perceived death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others that results in significant psychological trauma. Moreover, the ability of people to handle acute severe stress experiences varies among individuals. Depending on the underlying personality and resiliency, therefore, PTSD can occur in individuals exposed to exceedingly stressful incidences or those who have encountered seemingly less overwhelming stressors. In addition to severe stressful exposure, multiple other factors including genetic susceptibility; past experiences; cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs; bullying and harassments; and lack of support at the workplace, social, and home environement may contribute to the development of PTSD. Author investigated multiple potential mechanisms for the development and sustenance of PTSD based on the recent literature and his own experiences and insight. Based on this search, author indicates that among other pathological and biochemical abnormalities, hormonal aberrations are most likely key mechanisms initiating and the maintenance of the PTSD. These pathophysiological neuro-hormonal changes instigate maladaptive learning processes caused by sustained high levels of anxiety and fear, through a hypo-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary axis and hyper-responsive catecholamine system (persistently elevated blood norepinephrine levels and lower than appropriate glucocorticoid levels). In addition to having inappropriately low serum cortisol levels and high epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, patients with PTSD also have mitochondrial dysfunctions and other hormonal abnormalities. Based on these data, author concluded that these pathological, biochemical and sustained neurohormonal abnormalities are likely to influence the structural brain changes, particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus, which are characteristics of patients with PTSD. Considering these abnormalities, neuroendocrine system needs to be considered as a key target for new drug development for prevention and treatment of PTSD.

      "abstract": "Repetitive Strain Injury, RSI for short, is characterised by a variety of sensory and/or motor complaints of the upper limb that have developed due to intensive and long-lasting use of the computer. Beside causes of physical nature, psychosocial factors such as working tempo, perceived stress, and cognitive demands are acknowledged to have an exacerbating effect. Although latter factors cannot be taken directly responsible for RSI, they contribute to the development of the disorder by creating adverse working conditions. This was demonstrated in a number of experiments where additional mental tasks, e.g. memorizing numbers, presented during the execution of a primary motor task, e.g. typewriting or drawing, caused muscular activity to increase. Continuously enhanced muscle activation is an acknowledged pathological mechanism leading to RSI. The controversy with respect to RSI is, among other things, caused by the observation that the patients' complaints cannot be verified by medical tests. In two studies that are described in the thesis, it now has been shown that particular signs suggest degraded motor control of the arm in patients who report forearm and hand complaints. This finding provides justification for further research into specific pathological mechanisms within the central nervous system that could lead to RSI. Furthermore, this research made clear that therapeutic interventions that are solely directed to alleviate the pain are most likely to result in failure. Effective treatment of RSI should encompass methods specifically aimed at restoring normal and healthy movement behaviour.",

This question has arisen repeatedly over the years, in part because of the apparent correspondence between the illnesses of depression and mania on the one hand, and the emotions of sadness and elation on the other. The latter, as transient mood states, can be triggered by events. If the illness depression is viewed as a kind of supersadness or the illness mania as superelation, then by extension one might assume that those discrete disorders can also be triggered by events. Making this assumption, physicians and patients alike often seek a causal connection between stressful events and sustained affective disorder. In an individual case it is impossible to prove or",

However, in the physical impairment related diseases, it is difficult for the disease to occur only by internal factors, and it can be said that internal factors and external factors are combined. Therefore, when the physical impairment is caused by disease, it is important to the apportionment analysis of injury to think about the cause of the physical impairment by considering both the external and internal factors. The most commonly used the apportionment guide is the “Rhim's trauma apportionment guideline” in impairment evaluation. But this guideline is often difficult to assess in certain diseases. Since the apportionment analysis of external factors can bring about a difference in degree according to the viewpoint of the assessor, the degree of the physical impairment may vary greatly depending on case by case. Especially, it is not reasonable to assess based on causal relation with common sense or emotional, and it is necessary to make rational assessment based on medical evidence and professional knowledge.",

Accurate treatment mandates a detailed history, often with collaboration with the family, and a thorough medical evaluation for other comorbid illnesses that may contribute to the patient's current presentation. The treatment of depressive symptoms in the elderly requires an understanding of both the origin of these symptoms and the proper treatment of the underlying disorder whether it is due to medical, dementing, psycho-social or melancholic factors.",

      "abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by high stress levels, which inevitably leads to neuroticism and psychopathization of the population. Emotional stress and the anxiety that follows it can be the cause and provocateur of some pathological processes and diseases. Unlike normal anxiety, intended to adapt the body, protect it and preserve life, pathological anxiety is inadequate to the intensity of the threat, is long-lasting, severe, and disrupts the quality of a person’s life and his activities. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis caused by stress leads to the development of psycho-vegetative syndrome – a complex of somatic, vegetative, and mental symptoms. However, in clinical practice, doctors usually encounter the fact that the patient more often presents various multisystem somatic complaints, ignoring emotional experiences. Undiagnosed anxiety can lead to chronicity or relapse of the disease, the prescription of only symptomatic therapy and aggravation of the course of the missed anxiety disorder. For a doctor to qualitatively assess the clinical picture, it is necessary to understand the structure of autonomic dysfunction in various systems and “recognize” the manifestations of anxiety. Managing such patients, especially comorbid ones, is a complex task, the solution of which will be most effective through joint efforts with psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, art therapy, music therapy, medications are an integral part of the therapy for this category of patients. Psychotropic drugs can reduce both anxiety and vegetative symptoms. For subclinical anxiety disorder with somatic manifestations, herbal sedatives or drugs based on them are used in outpatient practice, which have a favorable safety profile with sufficient effectiveness. The drug of choice may be Valocordin, which has sedative, antispasmodic, and hypnotic effects, which corresponds to the goals of treating psychovegetative syndrome.",

A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

      "abstract": "Experiencing mood swings after giving birth can last over a longer period of time. Those mood swings are largely the result of hormonal changes and the physical process of recovery after childbirth. The relationship between the mother and her family members, the doctor, and the nurses, as well as their experiences together, are of great importance during pregnancy, giving birth and afterwards. Except for those factors and other risks, which can cause postnatal psychological changes, there are other conditions for postnatal depression to emerge, such as the characteristics of the mothers in terms of dealing with stressful situations, as well as their history of mental illnesses. Psychological changes after giving birth, mood disorders, are manifested in several ways: from the usual mild reactions of sadness, which spontaneously disappear in a few days, to difficult and severe disorders, which require a specialist’s intervention and often the hospitalisation of the mother. In those grave cases, the distorted perception of their child and surroundings can result in the mother harming herself or her child.\r\n Preventing serious troubles, helping the mother after childbirth, as well as recognizing the symptoms and reducing the risks of postnatal distress are responsibilities of healthcare professionals. Trained through education and courses, house visits, clinical examinations before, during and after birth, those primary and secondary medical care professionals continuously participate in the postnatal care of women. It is not only important to insure the healthcare for the mother and child’s physical wellbeing, but also taking care of their emotional needs.\r\n This paper aims to analyse some of the risk factors and prevention of postnatal depression and psychosis, and their connection.\r\n The results of the study performed have shown partial uniformity with other studies. 37% of the women questioned have experienced postnatal sadness and 16% have experienced postnatal depression. However, it has been found that 3% of the female testimonies have shown a postnatal psychosis. Of all the symptoms, the women questioned have selected “feeling tired” and “lack of energy” to the greatest extent. The smallest number have selected recurring “suicidal thoughts” and “thoughts of death”. The results suggest the presence of light and temporary mood swings, but also show a small amount of severe problems, which can be identified as disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although diseases similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been recognized for centuries under various rubrics, strict diagnostic criteria for conditions dominated by medically unexplained chronic fatigue were first proposed in 1988. Current diagnostic criteria were originally crafted in 1994 by an International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group as an attempt to standardize patient populations included in research studies. The International CFS Research Case Definition requires chronic fatigue of at least six‐months duration; this fatigue cannot be substantially alleviated by rest, is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is associated with substantial reductions in occupational, social, and personal activities. In addition, at least four out of the following eight symptoms must occur with fatigue in a six‐month period: prolonged extraordinary postexertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, aching or stiff muscles, multijoint pain, sore throat, tender glands, and new headaches (Fukuda et al., 1994). Importantly, the research case definition precludes classification as CFS if a patient has an identifiable medical cause of being fatigued. Similarly, individuals with certain psychiatric conditions cannot be classified as CFS in research studies. Exclusionary psychiatric conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and melancholic major depression. Notably, comorbidity with psychiatric disorders is relatively high. Recent data indicate that almost 60% of CFS cases in the population suffer from at least one comorbid psychiatric condition, with affective disorders being the most prevalent ones.",

      "title": "Preventing and Treating Chronic Disabling Pain After Surgery",
      "abstract": "Background: Chronic postoperative pain (CPP) is an important health problem. This is a narrative review of etiologies, mechanisms, risk factors, means of reducing the risk, and treatment of chronic postoperative pain. Methods: This is a topical review based on a focused literature review and personal clinical experience and research efforts on chronic pain after surgical interventions. Results: CPP is defined as new pain in the area of surgery that lasts more than 3-6 months after the operation, is clearly related to tissue and nerve injuries during the operation and cannot be explained by other etiologies. The overall prevalence is that 20-40% have some pain and discomfort for a few weeks, 10% have moderate pain that cannot be neglected for a few months, about 1% develop debilitating CPP. CPP is caused by nerve and tissue injury and abnormal reactions to such injury. Only those who have preand peri-operative risk factors determined in part by genetic makeup, reinforced by abnormal pain modulating mechanisms, having chronic pain in other part(s) of the body, having psychological stress factors and catastrophizing thoughts and anxiety, having severe acute pain during and immediately after surgery, chemotherapy or radiation after cancer surgery, and being younger rather than elderly. Risks of CPP can be estimated by a simple scoring system with approximate risk prediction determined by the number and degree of preoperative risk factors. A number of procedures and drugs can ameliorate these risk factors: Regional and local anesthetic techniques when appropriate, anti-hyperalgesic drugs with nitrous Introduction Long-lasting new pain after an operation is a common, sometimes a debilitating consequence of surgery. We know some factors that increase the risk of developing chronic postoperative pain (CPP). The patients’ GP, surgeon, and anesthesiologist must focus on these risks and prioritize efforts to reduce their effects on the postoperative course. As Rashiq and Dick pointed out recently (1), the earliest practitioners of anesthesia could only pray that their patients survived anesthesia. Later generations, when anesthesia developed into a very safe practice, focused on reducing immediate complications after anesthesia and surgery. They established effective prophylaxis and treatment of acute pain, nausea, vomiting, and venous thromboembolism (2)]. The present generations of anesthesiologists, in collaboration with surgeons, are taking on the challenge of reducing long-term (1) Professor em at University of Oslo, Norway and consultant at Department of Anesthesiology, Rishospitalet and Department of Pain Management and Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway oxide, glucocorticoids, gabapentinoids, pregabalin more than gabapentin, possibly tricyclic antidepressant, and infusions of lidocaine and ketamine. Important is that the surgeon uses nerve-sparing techniques and operates as “atraumatic” as possible. Fast-track and vigorous mobilization and rehabilitation of functions after surgery is made possible by expert analgesic and anti-hyperalgesic drugs. Mot important is to NOT do unnecessary operations such as cosmetic breast enlargement and meniscectomies for atraumatic knee-meniscus degeneration. Acute Pain Service, extended to an Acute Pain-Followup Service is mandatory to make postoperative pain management optimal and to follow up and treat adequately those unfortunate patients who do develop CCP. Conclusions and implications: CPP is a common complication to well indicated surgery of any type, sometimes developing into a debilitating pain condition. Therefore, evaluation of risk factors before surgery and optimal management during and after surgery is highly important for the patient’s GP, his/her surgeon and anesthesiologist. Multidisciplinary pain management clinics are necessary for those unfortunate 1% of all surgical patients who develop complex, chronic postoperative pain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The more important part of the assessment of any patient with dizziness or unsteadiness is the clinical history. Symptoms of vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness can be present in diseases from many organs and systems so the doctor should not automatically equate dizziness with the inner ear. “True” or rotational vertigo implies involvement of the semicircular canals or their central connections, usually the brainstem or cerebellum. However, patients with fainting or syncope syndromes can describe transient rotational feelings as well. It is often the accompanying symptoms and presentation pattern that leads to a diagnosis. Some of the questions doctors should try to answer are: Is this a single, prolonged attack of vertigo, as in vestibular neuritis or brainstem stroke? Is this a recurrent vertiginous syndrome, as in vestibular migraine or Meniere’s disease? Are there any associated migraneous features like in the former or aural symptoms like in the latter? Are the symptoms provoked by lying down/turning over in bed, as in BPPV, or only occur whilst standing up as in postural hypotension? Are there any associated brainstem symptoms as in TIAs or demyelination? Is the patient chronic “dizziness” a progressive gait disorder? Carefully enquiring about the nature of the symptom (vertigo, dizziness, fainting sensation, unsteadiness), presentation (acute, recurrent, chronic, progressive), duration and triggers is vital in reaching a diagnosis.",

It is consistently agreed that cognitive impairment is an important risk factor for developing functional disabilities in patients with dementia. Functional status can be conceptualized as the ability to perform self-care, self- maintenance and physical activity. A person with dementia usually requires help with more complex tasks, such as managing bills and finances, or simply maintaining a household. Good functional performance is fundamental for elderly people to maintain independency and avoid institutionalization. The purpose of this review is to describe functional changes in demented patients, evaluating the variability in subgroups of dementias.Demência é caracterizada por declínio na memória, linguagem, resolução de problemas e de outros domínios cognitivos que afetam a capacidade de realização de atividades cotidianas e atividades sociais. É consensual que o comprometimento cognitivo é um importante fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de incapacidades funcionais em pacientes com demência. O status funcional pode ser conceituado como a capacidade de realizar autocuidado, automanutenção e atividade física. Uma pessoa com demência geralmente requer ajuda para tarefas mais complexas, como gerenciar contas e finanças, ou simplesmente realizar atividades domésticas. Um bom desempenho funcional é fundamental para que os idosos mantenham a independência e evitem a institucionalização.

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "Pain presents an ethical problem in psychotherapy which it shares with other symptoms. It presents this problem because initially it does not give rise to the same expectations as overt psychological complaints such as depression or anxiety. At first glance pain appears to represent an obvious example of the traditional doctor/patient relationship...I hope to demonstrate that what began as a transaction in the medicine of organic disease, may become, before the patient recognizes it, a process of personal change of which the consequences may often not be foreseen. Such a development poses a problem in bioethics. If the development can be foreseen, the problem may be forestalled. If not, the proceedings may reflect paternalism and we need to consider if that is acceptable. The problem is not unique to pain but tends to be masked by the initial context of somatic treatment.",

These behavior changes can be seen early in the course of PD and may antedate motor dysfunction, providing empirical evidence for an “organic” rather than reactive etiology. Postmortem and in vivo biochemical as well as neuroimaging studies lend support to this hypothesis, with mesolimbic dopamine and serotonin abnormalities and fronto-limbic dysfunction demonstrated in affected patient subgroups.3\n\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms can also begin later in the illness suggesting that additional factors, acting in concert with ongoing neurodegenerative changes, are important in their etiology. These factors include progressive and fluctuating motor symptoms, medication side effects, premorbid personality traits, psychosocial stressors, and the presence of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric comorbidity.4 It is not yet clear how these factors interact or which are most critical, a fact underscored by the absence of neurobehavioral signs in many patients with seemingly comparable disease features and risk factors.\n\nNonetheless, most neuropsychiatric syndromes are usually attributed to selective dysfunction of specific prefrontal and limbic cortical-striatal-thalamic pathways.5 This conceptual approach directly parallels strategies used to delineate physiologic and biochemic abnormalities mediating motor symptoms.6 Classic lesion-deficit studies support such links, with onset of depression, mania, …",

You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "When terminal sedation is made the object of bioethical discussion, it is mostly in a way that a literary critic might call synecdochal: A part is taken for the whole. What is made the object of discussion is a whole of which terminal sedation is only a part. Not unlike discussions of prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation diagnosis, it is only the combination with other medical behaviors that creates ethical problems. In the case of terminal sedation, it is the combination with the termination of some nonpalliative medical treatment. Only in this combination does terminal sedation become a form of euthanasia.\r\n\r\nIf one takes for granted the standard definition of terminal sedation, this medical procedure cannot by itself be considered to constitute an act of euthanasia. By this definition, terminal sedation is a treatment administered when other palliative treatments are not sufficiently effective, and which aims at keeping a severely suffering patient unconscious in the proximity of death. Relevant indications are agitation, fear of suffocating, vomiting, sleeplessness, and states of severe pain. According to this definition, the adjective “terminal” refers to nothing but the temporal incidence of sedation and leaves open the causal relation between sedation and subsequent death. It does not prejudge the issue of whether sedation stands in any causal relation to the patient's death. As a rule, it is assumed to have no causal role in this death; it makes it easier for the patient to live his last period of life, but does not causally contribute to death. It constitutes help in dying and not help to die.\r\n\r\nWhat is more controversial is the classification and evaluation of combinations of terminal sedation with the termination of other medical treatments, either preceding or following sedation.[1] This combination has been increasingly applied in medical practice, especially in The Netherlands, the country about whose practice we are best informed. In The Netherlands, terminal sedation has been increasingly used as an alternative to active euthanasia. The most recent Dutch survey, which for the first time includes information about terminal sedation, shows that in 2001 terminal sedation was given in 5.6% of all deaths. It also shows that in almost two thirds of these cases artificial nutrition and hydration were simultaneously withdrawn.[2] This combination of terminal sedation and termination of treatment, understood as the termination of some or all life-sustaining nonpalliative measures, will be the focus of discussion.",

In general it may be stated that hypocalcemic states are manifested clinically by signs and symptoms of tetany. The symptom complex of tetany is now less common than in former times when rachitic tetany was the most frequent cause of convulsions in infancy. It was well described in the older literature. The manifestations consist of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms, irritability often alternating with lethargy, nystagmus and strabismus, contractions and pain in the muscles of the face with half moon eyes, carp mouth, trismus and convulsions Edema, most marked in the hands, feet and around the eyes is often observed. Confirmatory signs of tetany may be elicited by special methods of examination. Chvostek9s sign, jerking of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped, is a sign of tetany in children from one month to two years of age. It is unreliable in newborn infants, in older children and adults since in them it may be present normally. When the facial muscles are in spasm with manifest tetany it can seldom be elicited. The peroneal sign consists of dorsiflexion and abduction of the foot on tapping the peroneal nerve on the lateral surface of the fibula just before the knee. Trousseau9s sign is carpopedal spasm induced by pressure applied for some time over the upper arm or leg. Erb9s sign, or increased electrical excitability of the peripheral nerves to the galvanic current, was the most reliable proof of tetany in the days before blood chemical analyses were available. The procurement of electrical reactions is such a time consuming procedure that they are seldom sought for now.",

Insomnia was consistently predictive of depression, anxiety disorders, other psychological disorders, alcohol abuse or dependence, drug abuse or dependence, and suicide, indicating insomnia is a risk factor for these difficulties. Additionally, insomnia was related to decreased immune functioning. The data were inconclusive regarding insomnia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality, but sleep medication use was predictive of mortality. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that significant weaknesses existed in the studies reviewed. The main weaknesses were inadequate definition of insomnia and inadequate control for alternative explanations.

This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "Can chronic muscular pain be understood?",
      "abstract": "Chronic muscular pain is often regarded as incomprehensible or indefinable when the doctor ``can't find anything'' on examination. However, the physiotherapist often detects physical signs in these patients: changes in posture, holding breath, tense and hard musculature, and poor balance. The findings are dependent on what is being sought. The view of the body as ambiguous, as something a person has and is, can shed light on the way life has left its traces in the body, such as changes in posture and poor balance. In this article it will be argued that combining a physiotherapeutic, a phenomenological, and a biological perspective can make chronic muscular pain more comprehensible. Chronic muscular pain can be perceived not as a sign representing a symbol of underlying factors but rather as a sign understood as an expression of the bodily state.",

Physical activity has been shown to have both preventative and therapeutic benefits for mental health. The mental health benefits of physical activity in the general population provide a rationale for therapeutic application in those with established mental health problems. Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for global mortality with sedentary behaviour now recognised as a major public health issue. The benefits of being physically active are well documented and include the prevention and management of mental health conditions. The chapter introduces the scale of the challenge that mental health problems pose, globally and in the United Kingdom (UK), in terms of health, health care provision, and the economic burden. The multiple benefits of physical activity for mental, physical, and social health, and the absence of side-effects, make it an appealing adjunct or alternative to pharmacological treatments.",

It is not enough investigated, what kind of disorders they are like, their characteristics are, and how they differ from schizoid personality disorder and continuous sluggish schizophrenia. with the aim to define the clinical features of schizotypal personality disorder 58 patients were examined. Results: • Schizotypal personality disorder is similar to deficit states, observed at schizophrenia, clinically limited to personality sphere, without the signs of flow of endogenous process and psychotic disorders. • Schizotypal personality disorder on the clinical content reminds schizoid, but insignificant ideatory disorders are typical. Dymamic of psychopathy - disposition to decompensation - is never observed. • Schizotypal personality disorder can be diagnosed as latent schizophrenia, because the clinical picture is similar. the special value acquires a dynamic aspect typical of the endogenous process. • High quality remission of schizophrenia limited of specific personality changes, as a variant of «acquired psychopathy» can be considered as clinically identical to «schizotypal personality disorder». Conclusion: A content of Schizotypal personality disorder includes a group of disorders of schizophrenia spectrum, different originally, from shizofreniform personality disorders without the signs of dynamics to the different states of development of schizophrenia - initial (latent schizophrenia), and final (high quality remission of schizophrenia as practical completion of schizophrenia process with the formation of certain features of personality).

      "title": "Selected Physiological Dimensions of Communication Apprehension",
      "abstract": "Abstract Communication apprehension (CA) is generally defined as a predisposition to avoid communication, if possible, or experience anxiety symptoms when forced to communicate with others. CA was conceptualized as a trait-like tendency to respond, meaning that the inclination to avoid communication or experience anxiety during social interaction was fairly stable across time. State anxiety, on the other hand, is transitory in nature, and while it often represents the manifestation of CA, it can be triggered by situational factors even in communicators low in the trait. Although the construct was initially conceptualized as a cognitively experienced trait, the psychological literature on anxiety symptoms usually includes physiological symptoms. Indeed, studies published since the initial development of the CA construct have indicated that state anxiety experienced during communication is correlated with physiological measures. More recent work indicates that trait CA, while not typically correlated with measures such as heart rate, is correlated with stable, individual differences in brain activity. This chapter focuses on the complex theoretical and empirical relationships among physiological responses, trait CA, and communication state anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression is a ubiquitous term we use to refer to transient feelings of low mood or sadness that are occasional responses to the stresses of daily life. However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

The clinical picture may for a long time be dominated by disturbances of posture and gait (the myostatic phase of Wechsler and Brock<sup>2</sup>) before muscular restlessness becomes evident. Such cases do not even suggest dystonia and therefore are usually labeled hysteria, chorea, athetosis or some other form of muscular restlessness. Because dystonia resembles some other clinical manifestations, there is a tendency to discard it as a clinical entity. According to others, dystonia not only is a clinical entity but exhibits definite pathologic changes in some basal ganglions—caudate nucleus and putamen (corpus striatum).

      "abstract": "Abstract In contrast to many clinical pain syndromes, wherein a medical history and physical examination usually lead to the diagnosis of a structural lesion or biochemical alteration, the functional pain syndromes are without fixed organic peripheral changes. The functional pain disorders include fibromyalgia (FM), atypical facial pain (also termed idiopathic facial pain), non-specific low-back pain (NSLBP), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and are characterized by their persistence, intractability, and apparent absence of peripheral disease. Various psychiatric designations have been applied to pain disorders that are characterized by medically unexplained symptoms: somatization, somatoform disorders, psychogenic disease, chronic multisymptom illness, affective spectrum disorders, and central sensitization syndromes as well as functional disorders (Barsky &amp; Borus, 1999; Clauw &amp; Chrousos, 1997; Clauw et al.,1997; Hudson et al.,1992; Hudson &amp; Pope, 1989; Wessely et al.,1999). A functional disorder is one that, after appropriate medical assessment, cannot be explained in terms of a conventionally defined medical disease based on biochemical or structural abnormalities (Derbyshire et al.,2004; Wessely et al.,1999; Drossman et al.,2000).Although these disorders are routinely assessed and viewed as separate clinical entities, combining these systemic and regional conditions in a review is justified by several observations: (1) there is considerable overlap in the case definitions of specific syndromes, (2) the disorders co-aggregate in individuals, (3) patients with different syndromes share non-symptom characteristics, (4) the functional syndromes all respond to similar therapies, (5) the syndromes share common neurobiological mechanisms, such as abnormal sensory processing, neuroendocrine, and autonomic dysfunction (Wessely et al.,1999),",

Demographic factors, especially those revealing changing social status, recent loss, intentionality, lethality, past history, and high-risk groups, can be rapidly assessed. Viewing suicide as a final common pathway of system dysfunction at any or all major levels-biologic, psychologic, sociocultural-leads to an appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of passive or active \"self murder\" impulses. Persons depressed for any significant length of time for whatever reasons are potentially suicidal. Thus, the \"typical\" depression is suicidal but so are persons whose depression is related to drug side effects, primary illness effects, to living in a dysfunctional family system, or to normal grief. Diagnosis requires inquiry about the depth of the patient's depression pain.

      "abstract": "Addiction is a specific psychosocial result of a complex neurobiological process in the existence of individuals. As pharmacologically term addiction arises from creation of physiological adaptation to the substance and with occurrence of withdrawal syndrome in the moment of cessation of both substance intake and effect of the substance. With psychobiological disorders created as a result of such adaptations, addiction becomes the illness of central nervous system. Persistent and compulsive usage is created through forming of long term associative memory in several neural networks including prefrontal cortex. 'Pathological usurpation of neural of learning and memory mechanisms, which normally serve to shape behavior connected to the reward as well as a signal for prediction of reward' Defining one phenomenon with addiction term requires application of medical model. Therefore illness is defined before all with existence of stable pathological signs and symptoms, which are expressed through dysfunction of some organs and followed by individual experience of torment and misery of individuals. Symptoms have to have stable and regular occurrence with large number of patients and make one clinical picture. This allows diagnostics, classification and requires treatment. Outcome of the addiction and future career /destiny of the addict largely is connected with his/her primary bio-psychological potentials and possible other diagnosis besides addiction. Therefore, therapeutic possibilities in treatment of addictions are determined by the use of pharmaco-therapeutic means, but in many cases they are determined by society’s attitude towards psychoactive substance and addicts. Namely, the goals of treatment depend on it, as well as different modalities of rehabilitation and social reintegration of addicts. This paper analyzes forms of treatment and rehabilitation of addicts, it also estimates theoretical forecast of treatment possibilities with realistically realized therapeutic programs.",

      "title": "Differentiating Psychosomatic, Somatopsychic, Multisystem Illnesses and Medical Uncertainty",
      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "title": "Decision Fatigue in Dermatopathology: Cognitive Load and Diagnostic Vulnerability",
      "abstract": "Histopathological diagnosis is cognitively demanding, requiring complex pattern recognition, clinical integration, and decision-making under time pressure. A largely overlooked factor in dermatopathology is decision fatigue—the decline in decision quality after sustained cognitive effort. Well described in psychology, it reflects mental exhaustion that impairs information processing, risk assessment, and judgment [1]. Various psychological models attempt to explain this phenomenon and describe the mechanisms behind it. Decision fatigue describes a cognitive state in which the quality of decisions decreases after prolonged stress. This phenomenon was first described by Baumeister and colleagues as part of the theory of ego depletion. They postulate that the ability to self-regulate is a limited resource that can be depleted by prolonged cognitive effort. As a result of this depletion, individuals tend to make more impulsive decisions or avoid decisions altogether [2]. In clinical practice, for example, decision fatigue manifests itself in the tendency to prefer standard decisions or to postpone complex decisions. Studies show that medical staff under high decision-making pressure tend to make defensive decisions or order additional, possibly unnecessary, diagnostic tests more frequently. This may be due to reduced cognitive capacity exhausted by sustained decision-making demands. However, recent research suggests that the effects of decision fatigue are not exclusively due to the depletion of a limited self-regulatory resource. Rather, factors such as motivation, individual beliefs about one's own willpower, and external environmental conditions also play a decisive role. For example, studies show that people who are convinced that their willpower is unlimited are significantly less susceptible to typical symptoms of decision fatigue [3, 4]. Another key model for explaining decision fatigue is the System 1/System 2 model developed by Daniel Kahneman [5]. Kahneman distinguishes between two types of thinking: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, automatic, and emotionally controlled. System 1 requires little cognitive effort. System 2 is characterized by slow, analytical, controlled, rational thinking and requires high cognitive resources. According to Kahneman, decision fatigue leads people to increasingly fall back on the fast, intuitive System 1 because the more strenuous System 2 is already exhausted or is avoided to save energy. As a result, decisions are less well thought out, more influenced by heuristics or routines, and potentially more prone to error [5]. Regardless of the exact cause, however, the observation remains consistent that long phases of intensive cognitive stress—as are typical in everyday medical diagnosis—can lead to a measurable deterioration in the quality of decision-making [6]. These findings suggest a shift from a purely resource-based model of decision fatigue to a more dynamic view that includes psychological factors. In dermatopathology, where many complex decisions are made under time pressure, this increases the risk of diagnostic errors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for effective prevention and intervention. Dermatopathology is highly susceptible to decision fatigue due to high case volume, subtle findings, and limited clinical context. Complex entities like atypical melanocytic lesions or early lymphoproliferative disorders demand nuanced judgment, which is further challenged by cognitive fatigue. Dermatopathological diagnostics places particularly high cognitive demands as it operates at the interface between clinical dermatology and microscopic morphology. Numerous decision-making situations in everyday dermatopathology are potentially susceptible to decision fatigue, especially when a large number of similar cases have to be processed without sufficient clinical contextual information [7]. A classic example is the assessment of melanocytic lesions. While the distinction between clearly benign nevi and clearly malignant melanomas is relatively clear in many cases, there is a broad diagnostic gray area spectrum ranging from \"atypical nevi\" to \"melanocytic lesions of undetermined biological potential\" [8]. These zones of uncertainty require a high level of concentration and differential diagnostic sensitivity. Under conditions of cognitive exhaustion, there is a risk of either overcalling or undercalling to shorten the decision-making process. The diagnosis of inflammatory dermatoses is also characterized by a high degree of variability and is often confronted with unspecific patterns. Here, the risk of decision fatigue is particularly evident in the fact that findings are generally described as \"non-specific\" or \"compatible with dermatitis\" without systematically documenting the differential diagnostic considerations that are necessary. The diagnostic depth typically decreases over the course of a long working day—an observation that has hardly been systematically investigated to date, but is repeatedly noticed in daily practice. There is also a tendency to order additional immunohistochemistry or additional molecular tests in difficult cases—in some cases less out of differential diagnostic necessity than as a psychological \"relief mechanism\" to cushion their own uncertainty. This form of defensive diagnostics can increase costs and processing times, on the one hand, and entail the risk of over-interpretation of additional technical findings, on the other [9, 10]. Finally, decision fatigue is also reflected in the language used in diagnostic formulations. While differentiated assessments with clear recommendations for action dominate at the beginning of the working day, vague phrases such as \"essentially unremarkable\" or \"to be correlated with a suitable clinic\" are often used at the end of the day. Such formulations can be interpreted as a cognitive relief strategy, as they reduce the need for precise definitions. Studies from clinical medicine show that not only the decision-making style but also the linguistic formulation changes with increasing mental fatigue [6, 11]. Although such data have not yet been obtained from dermatopathology or pathology, the findings suggest that linguistic clarity also decreases with increasing fatigue in histological diagnostics. Vague diagnoses may shift responsibility to clinicians without clear guidance, risking miscommunication and treatment delays. This highlights that decision fatigue in dermatopathology can impact diagnostic quality and clinical care, despite limited research. Structural factors in daily practice foster its unnoticed development. Dermatopathology laboratories often process hundreds of samples per day, from trivial excisions to shave biopsies to complex issues. Many of these cases are recurrently similar, leading to a monotonous cognitive load. Dermatopathology has been shown to exhibit high interobserver variability in challenging entities such as lichenoid dermatoses and atypical melanocytic lesions, often compounded by incomplete clinical information and high daily case volumes [12-14]. Moreover, Weyers critically highlights that the ambition for precise histopathological classification often borders on illusion, underscoring the limitations and subjectivity inherent in our field [15]. The quantitative workload forces dermatopathologists to make decisions at high frequency and often under time pressure. At the same time, dermatopathology is characterized by extreme morphological variability. Many inflammatory and neoplastic dermatoses are histologically similar or overlapping, while at the same time, additional clinical information such as exact localization, course, previous diagnoses, or treatment details are often incomplete or not available at all. The need to decide \"in a vacuum\" further increases the cognitive load, as dermatopathologists must constantly make implicit assumptions about the clinical context—a typical breeding ground for heuristics and poor decisions, especially in phases of exhaustion. Unlike in many technical disciplines, dermatopathological diagnosis remains subjective. Numerous studies show interobserver and intraobserver variability, even among experienced experts [16, 17]. This fundamental level of variability is further increased by decision fatigue, as individual fluctuations in judgment are exacerbated by fatigue [7, 10, 18]. In dermatopathology, missing feedback loops hinder learning and self-assessment: errors often go unnoticed, positive feedback is rare, and judgment remains uncalibrated. Combined with high workload, uncertainty, and limited clinical context, this fosters decision fatigue. Several evidence-based strategies can mitigate decision fatigue: scheduling complex decisions early in the day, taking brief cognitive breaks, grouping tasks by complexity, minimizing multitasking and distractions, and fostering metacognitive self-monitoring and peer consultation. While not yet specifically studied in dermatopathology, these approaches offer a transferable framework for optimizing diagnostic decision-making [19-21]. Cognitive load is a subtle yet powerful factor in dermatopathology, influencing decisions, leading to vague wording, overcaution, or overinterpretation—especially under pressure, fatigue, or limited information. This is not individual failure, but a systemic issue that remains underrecognized. While resilience varies among diagnosticians, the phenomenon of decision fatigue is plausible and transferable from clinical medicine to dermatopathology. Pathology reports are not absolute truths but products of complex cognitive processes shaped by specific working conditions. Clinical input—history, comorbidities, prior findings, and images—is essential for context-based diagnostics. Sharing diagnostic uncertainty is not weakness, but professional responsibility. To counter decision fatigue, greater awareness of cognitive limits, structured breaks, and transparent communication are first steps. Interdisciplinary training and feedback systems can further support diagnostic precision and reduce overload, particularly in high-throughput environments.

However, the most important principle that a clinician must embrace is that sexual pain disorders are a complex interplay between physical and psychological factors. The physical examination is part of the psychotherapeutic consultation in psychosexual medicine. In psychosexual medicine, every patient is unique and the approach to identifying and elucidating the nuances of each patient's story will vary from case to case.

In a review of the psychosomatic aspects of dermatology, Koblenzer offered a working classification of the psychodermatoses. This is helpful to the podiatrist in recognizing those dermatologic disease states in which the various aspects of the individual participate in the disease, signs and symptoms of the disease, and the potential psychological value of the disease for the patient. It is also helpful to the podiatrist for recognizing those dermatoses in which psychiatric consultation may be useful so that recognition, treatment, improvement, and perhaps cure may be effected quickly.",

From these studies, further attempt was made to establish the basic mechanisms which come into play during a stressor stimulus and consequently modulate the physiology of the body.

Notwithstanding the variety of theories and the diversity of presentation of anxiety disorders, it would appear that cognitive dysfunction of one sort or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations.

If an individual cannot cope or needs a great deal of effort to cope, stress is experienced, the environmental event becomes stressful and major health consequences seem to arise.

      "abstract": "Orthostatic headache is a key symptom of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Other features may include neck pain, interscapular pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision. Various psychological or mental symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and a decreased power of concentration may also occur in this syndrome. When these symptoms are prominent or precede the onset of other symptoms, the clinical picture of this syndrome becomes more complicated, leading to misdiagnosis or long-term neglect. Of note, patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage who visit an otolaryngological or oto-neurological clinic usually have atypical manifestations. In the vast majority of our patients with this syndrome, the presenting symptom is dizziness, not headache. The presenting symptom of the 30-year-old female patient who is the subject of this report was also dizziness. The patient's initial symptom was a stomachache; however, medical therapy was ineffective, and endoscopic examination of the stomach revealed no abnormalities. The stomachache was diagnosed as resulting from psychological or mental causes. Other manifestations also indicated that the patient suffered from mental depression. Antidepressants and sleeping pills were prescribed, but no improvement was noted. Dizziness, unsteadiness, nausea, and loss of concentration occurred insidiously and worsened after the patient hit her occiput strongly against a wall during an attack of hyperventilation. The patient also complained of headache. The patient was referred to our clinic by a local otolaryngologist. At the time of the patient's initial visit, a slight unsteadiness was noted while the patient stood and walked, but other vestibular functions were normal. A neurological examination did not show any abnormalities. Psychological testing confirmed the presence of depression. The patient, presumably because of her depression, was dispirited and never discussed her symptoms voluntarily. However, a detailed history revealed that the patient had an orthostatic headache, paresthesia in both hands, blurred vision, and forgetfulness. Several episodes of falls at a pool-side occurring as early as during elementary school were also noted. The diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed by brain MRI and 111In-cisternography examinations. An epidural blood patch was performed three times. The patient recovered from her depression; although a mild headache and nausea persisted, all the patient's other symptoms, including dizziness and unsteadiness, improved dramatically. The patient returned to work.",

Beautiful and straight teeth have become part of modern life, his well-being, health and social status. Any abnormalities always affect the psyche. Patients with dental system pathology suffer from changes in appearance, violations of phonetics, chewing function and this formed the difficulties in communication.

      "title": "Psychological Factors and Heart Disease",
      "abstract": "A number of studies have revealed that perceived emotional stress can produce various transient cardiovascular responses. The reactions may include changes in heart rate and cardiac output. They may include abnormalities in heart rhythm, changes in blood pressure, peripheral resistance, blood viscosity, blood clotting time, and serum cholesterol levels. A hypothesis suggested by the findings which requires further research follows: If these cardiovascular responses were sustained for a period of time, they would ultimately influence the onset or course of coronary artery disease. These studies also suggest that emotional tension at one's work may place an additional strain on an already diseased heart. In patients whose cardiovascular system is already impaired, investigators have traced the sequence from emotional upset to heart disease. Since the reported evidence has been based on cardiac subjects, it is still possible that \"gradual increase in tension\" is perceived only after illness occurs, but not necessarily perceived as stressful before beart disease. Owing to the lack of prospective studies in which the life stress factors are studied prior to heart disease, emotion as a cause or contributory factor to heart disease has not been fully accepted. These studies suggest that certain personality traits may be common to certain forms of heart disease. Most of this evidence has been observed from time-consuming, detailed personality analysis, and the evidence depends on studies of relatively few patients and poor or no controls. It is important to note that these studies on personality type and heart disease were conducted after heart disorders developed. This raises the question of whether the reported personality characteristics preceded or followed the heart disease. The investigations to date assume that the personality structure occurred before the appearance of the heart disease, but before we can answer this question, a longitudinal study of the personality of individuals prior to cardiovascular disease would be necessary.",

Often they seem to peter out or, at least, the family becomes able to cope with the symptom at a domestic level, once the doctor has guessed or established the family’s specific fear, and has been able to reassure them that the pains are not, for example, appendicitis, leukaemia or a brain tumour. Other family members may have dysmenorrhoea, indigestion, or migraine. The abdomen and head and limbs seem to be the most common sites for recurrent pains in children; chest pains or chronic backache are rarer. Although, in most patients, there is no physical cause to account for the pain, careful assessment is necessary. Chronic backache, unlike the others, is more usually a symptom of some underlying organic pathology in a child. It, and limb pains are discussed in Chapter 21.",

The individual may then attempt to repair those disrupted developmental needs by such symptomatic expressions as eating disorders, compulsive exercise, substance abuse, and the creation of physical danger, as a step toward integration of mind and body as well as a defensive antidote to painful affect. In the psychoanalytic treatment of these patients, the need for the analyst's attunement to the patient's development of body self as well as psychological self development is illustrated by clinical vignettes of the enactments and attempted restitution of specific developmental trauma.",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

      "title": "The condition of insomnia: Etiopathogenetic considerations and their impact on treatment practices",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is conceived as the subjective complaint of reduced sleep quantity and/or quality, even in the absence of objective verification of sleep loss; it is the outcome of the interplay of many environmental, biological, and psychological factors, which can be distinguished into predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. Predisposing and precipitating factors include various demographic characteristics and the occurrence of psychiatric or somatic illnesses as well as other stressful life events. The perpetuating factors, responsible for the development of chronicity of the complaint of insomnia, mainly involve a 24-hour state of hyperarousal and a vicious cycle of sleeplessness causing fear of sleeplessness which in turn leads to further hyperarousal and more sleeplessness. Particular psychological characteristics, including excessive use of denial and repression as well as a strong propensity for internalisation of emotions, are also among the main factors contributing to the psychophysiological activation and state of hyper-arousability commonly encountered among insomniac patients. The treatment should not only focus on ameliorating sleeplessness, it should also address all those factors that cause and maintain insomnia. An integrative management of insomnia includes education on sleep hygiene measures, behavioural, cognitive and psychodynamic psychotherapies, and the utilization of sleep-promoting drugs. Among the latter, only for the use of benzodiazepine or benzodiazepine-like hypnotics exists sufficient evidence for efficacy as well as adequate information on their side-effect profiles. Thus, these compounds are considered as the drugs of choice for the treatment of insomnia. It is recommended that the use of hypnotic drugs is restricted to the initial period of treatment; they should be rationally utilized within the context of a broad therapeutic program, which is based on a sound doctor-patient relationship and includes sleep hygiene education and the application of certain psychotherapeutic techniques in an individualized manner.",

In such depressed patients, the tendency to express aggression against others has been seen as either denied, suppressed, or repressed, and hostile feelings toward the significant other not admitted into awareness where they would arouse painful guilt feelings.

Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

This is an alerting cue; past modes of reaction to stress in the form of physical patterns (but not conversion reactions); regressive shifts of defenses in the direction of resomatization; mounting aggression that is not directly verbalized; diminution of psychologically expressed guilt, though guilt would be expected and indeed becomes manifest in physical form; psychological versions of transference reactions replaced by expressions in body language; dreams in which stimuli from early physical dysfunction are recurrently part of the daily residue and give a somatic cast to current conflicts; identification with important objects that is increasingly expressed in somatic terms.

      "title": "Psychological and Psychosocial Consequences of Combat and Deployment with Special Emphasis on the Gulf War",
      "abstract": "Research in the neurosciences has demonstrated that the boundary between the external world (its events, pressures, concerns and stress) and the brain and body has been broken. The concept of anything being all in the mind is scientifically and intellectually dead. While some data remain ambiguous and direct causal effect cannot be given to stress per se, the overall patterns of research findings demonstrate that stress is a contributing factor to many illnesses, including somatic and psychological symptoms. Therefore, very real consequences attend those who experience prolonged subacute chronic stress, which characterized in the Gulf deployment, combat, and return home. It is feasible that the effects of these stresses made some soldiers more vulnerable to environmental pathogens, both in the theater and at home, than they would otherwise have been. The symptoms of such insults, nested in sociocultural beliefs about illness and the Gulf, might well have amplified deleterious somatic consequences. Like many illnesses, those pertaining to service in the Gulf have been culturally shaped. An illness narrative describes the causes of the illness as perceived by the patient and is most often constructed out of the assertions, metaphors, folklore, causal attributions, and adduced causes common in the patient's culture. Other agents of a presumed authorities, the Internet, and support and self-help groups. Such illness narratives can become an important factor in shaping both the nature and interpretation of symptoms by the patient. A cogent, widespread, and widely shared illness narrative is certainly a characteristic development of Gulf War illness. The threads of combat and deployment stress and the side spectrum of possible responses, as demonstrated throughout history, weaves into the matrix of possible illness causation. It is also possible that a subset of the population is (in some ways, not yet understood) vulnerable and predisposed to injurious responses to the multiple stressors experienced in deployment and combat. This book argues that, to be most helpful to veterans, we must deal with this issue of complexity and not simply focus on a hypothecated or hoped for singular cause of Gulf War illness.",

      "title": "Reactions to stressful experiences",
      "abstract": "In biological terms, stress literally means a force from the outside world acting upon an individual, and is a phenomenon we have all experienced. The term ‘stress’ was first used in the 1930s by the endocrin­ologist Hans Selye to describe the responses of la­boratory animals to various stimuli. Originally, Selye meant ‘stress’ to be the response of an organism to a perceived threat or ‘stressor’, but the term is now used to mean the stimulus rather than the response in some cases. When presented with a stressor of any type, everyone will produce a reaction to that stress, and this is a normal physiological event. However, if the reac­tion is prolonged, too intense, or atypical in some way, stress can become abnormal and cause problems. Stressful events, even when reacted to normally, are important contributors to the causes of many kinds of psychiatric disorder. In this chapter, we consider those psychiatric disorders that are specific reactions to stressful experiences. These may occur independently or alongside other psychiatric conditions and include: … ● acute stress reactions: short- term disorders after stressful events; ● post- traumatic stress disorder: a disorder following exceptionally severe stress; ● adjustment disorders: conditions occurring after a change in life circumstances; ● grief reactions: the normal and abnormal responses to bereavement; ● reactions to special kinds of acute stress: for example, traffic accidents, war, earthquakes, etc… For all these conditions, an identifiable stressor is a necessary but not always sufficient factor in its aetiology. GPs encounter the vast majority of patients with stress disorders who present to the health services, but all clinicians will see these patients in their clinical specialties. The reasons for this are threefold: … 1 Acute physical illness and its treatment are stressful. 2 Chronic illness or disability can result in substantial changes in life circumstances. 3 Clinicians treat people involved in other kinds of stressful experiences…. Everyone reacts to stress differently, and what consti­tutes a stressful event is therefore highly subjective. However, there are certain situations that are likely to be experienced as stressful by anyone. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is a list of 43 life events which predispose to stress- related illnesses, weighted ac­cording to their respective probability of doing so.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

At present, chronic pain disorders are diagnosed mainly on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, since the mechanism underlying the pathophysiology is not well understood. Many diagnostic criteria for atypical facial pain has been proposed without much benefit however, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out all other pathologies of the head and neck. Clinically, phantom tooth pain is similar in many essential characteristics to deafferentation pain syndrome.

      "abstract": "All humans will undergo aging, which has significant impacts both physically and mentally. Anxiety disorders are psychiatric disorders commonly encountered in the elderly and correlate with increased health burden, morbidity, mortality, and poor quality of life. The elderly with cardiovascular and multimorbid diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety disorders. This disorder can be a continuation of previous occurrences or a first-time event. The interaction between neurobiological, psychological, and environmental factors triggers the onset of this disorder. Diagnosis enforcement is often challenging due to comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders such as depression or cognitive disorders, as well as the similarity of anxiety symptoms to symptoms caused by other medical conditions or aging. The elderly find it difficult to accurately describe and identify anxiety. Expertise is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, this disorder often does not receive proper treatment, even though optimal management is crucial to improving outcomes and achieving optimal quality of life in the elderly. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches require special attention due to the impact of aging on organ function.

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

A comprehensive interview is very important in FMS, especially when there is a lack of objective findings. When patients are not given the opportunity to discuss their complaints, they will consult several doctors in an attempt to gain an understanding of their disease. The doctor should conduct the patient interview in a personal atmosphere, the seated beside, rather than in front of the patient. Further, the interviewer must listen attentively toward a better understanding of the particular autoplastic disease. After giving a thorough description of complaints, the patient should be encouraged to talk about his life and social history, family status, experiences in early childhood, educational level, occupation, and job conditions often have pathogenic influences. Also, very important are frequency and length of work absence due to disability, details about medical examinations and subsequent courses of treatment. Especially important is information about drug therapy, its efficacy, side-effects, and compliance. Furthermore, the doctor should determine and examine the pain, autonomic reactions, sleep disturbances, and other modulating factors. A good aid in obtaining a complete picture of the patients' disease is a self-report questionnaire; the answer given can then be scored, comparable with other findings, and they then will have good predictive value. Finally, the doctor must pay careful attention to the patients' non-verbal communication.",

The greatest interest, however, has been generated by the association between TBI and schizophrenia-like psychosis (Krafft-Ebing 1868), and this is the focus of this chapter. The most important question is whether TBI predisposes an individual to schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. If this association can be unequivocally established, a number of other issues become relevant, such as the prevalence of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI, its clinical features, risk factors, and prognosis. An important corollary is whether the study of schizophrenia-like psychosis following TBI can advance the understanding of the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

A paraphilic disorder is diagnosed when a paraphilia, defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as “any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners”, results in distress or impairment to the individual, personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. This review covers the definition, diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, etiology, phenomenology, diagnostic work-up, treatment modalities, guidelines, and prognosis of paraphilias including voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, pedophilic disorder, and transvestic disorder. The table and figure list paraphilic disorders listed in the DSM-5 and paraphilias in the Other specified paraphilic disorders section of the DSM-5.

      "title": "Stress An Overview and Ayurvedic Remedy",
      "abstract": "Stress is construed as anything which constitutes a threat- most often perceived-which adversely affect the general well-being of the individual concerned. Modern life , especially in corporate life, stress has become a norm which has been accepted - albeit unwillingly - as a part and parcel of existence. Long and odd working hours, pressure to achieve targets all the time, unhealthy food, non-conducive working environment or even environmental factors like extreme or high altitude could stimulate stress in a person. And prolonged exposure to stress leads to a number of clinical ailments like hypertension, anxiety, depression or on milder scale produces peptic ulcers, Insomnia and host of other ailments. Stress - Sahasa as it is known in Ayurveda - plays an important role in the aetiology of several diseases. The Eustress, positive life stimulant component of stress which helps us in improvement of all round performances - turns to Distress, when this demand for improvement becomes persistent and unmanageable for an individual. As per Ayurveda, stress causes Ojahksaya (Loss of Immunity) making our body increasingly susceptible to various infectious diseases.\r\nOne of the basic tenet of Ayurveda is Prevention is better than Cure. Keeping up with this adage here into the pivotal aim is to keep the onset of stress at bay i.e., negate chances of occurrence of stress and increase the coping capacity of the individual vis-a-vis stress if one become susceptible to it . To avoid occurrence of stress the body should be\r\nprotected by taking adequate care of Diet (Ahara), Sleep (Swapnoh) and Celibacy (Brahmacharyamiti), the three pillars of life. Any deviation in this primal aspects lead to variation of Tridoshas (Vata, Kapha and Pitta- three life supporting variants in the body) making it susceptible to diseases. In case of an unfortunate occurrence of stress (Sahasa), Ayurveda prescribes Lifestyle modification, Dietary interventions and finally Drug treatments. The management aspects of stress is well documented in Rasayana therapy, one of the eight branches of classic Ayurveda. Classical Ayurveda treatment approach to stress demands the patient to be non-violent with a balanced use of his sense organs with self-control and follow a nutritious dietary routine. Drug treatment which constitutes the final phase of the management of stress would only be effective if the above two aspects are followed in letter and spirit. The process aims to balance the vitiated doshas in the patient thereby bringing the patient back to a healthy state of well-being. The stress treatment mainly aim at modulation of immune response in the patient to bail him out of the immunosuppressive actions of the prolonged stress.\r\nTo conclude, as part of the stress avoidance one needs to follow a meditative non-violent life, eating dietarily balanced food. Try to Control your senses and desires and use them consciously. Despite all these measures if one gets caught up in the stress, it is recommended that consciously work up of the lifestyle modification and resort to Rasayana therapy under a well-founded Acharya (Teacher) of Ayurveda.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a pathologically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with both motor and increasingly recognized non-motor features. It is debated whether the non-motor manifestations in ET result from widespread neurodegeneration or are merely secondary to impaired motor functions and decreased quality of life due to tremor. It is important to review these features to determine how to best treat the non-motor symptoms of patients and to understand the basic pathophysiology of the disease and develop appropriate pharmacotherapies. In this review, retrospective and prospective clinical studies were critically analyzed to identify possible correlations between the severities of non-motor features and tremor. We speculated that if such a correlation existed, the non-motor features were likely to be secondary to tremor. According to the current literature, the deficits in executive function, attention, concentration, and memory often observed in ET are likely to be a primary manifestation of the disease. It has also been documented that patients with ET often exhibit characteristic personality traits. However, it remains to be determined whether the other non-motor features often seen in ET, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are primary or secondary to motor manifestations of ET and subsequent poor quality of life. Finally, there is evidence that patients with ET can also have impaired color vision, disturbances of olfaction, and hearing impairments, though there are few studies in these areas. Further investigations of large cohorts of patients with ET are required to understand the prevalence, nature, and true significance of the non-motor features in ET.",

Not surprisingly, the pediatric rheumatologist is frequently called to distinguish organic from functional symptoms. During the past decade, the pediatric rheumatology community has been evaluating increasing numbers of adolescents and preadolescents who experience musculoskeletal symptoms presumably as a defense against emotional stress from achievement either in academic work or in sports. To complicate the challenge further, coexistent organic and psychologic disturbance is not rare. Clearly, organic illness does not protect a patient from emotional plan, and it may be most difficult to differentiate nonorganic pain in a patient with a known organic illness. Conversely, adolescents with organic illness may use their disease for secondary gain. Fear of misdiagnosis of physical illness as psychiatric and the notion that all of the patient's complaints should be explained by a unifying diagnosis cause diagnostic error in both psychogenic illness with physical manifestations and physical illness with psychogenic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sexual hallucination is one of the distressful psychotic symptoms experienced across a variety of psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, sedative use, narcolepsy, and night terror, as well as in other conditions like epilepsy. Hence, ruling out organicity is a must in these cases. Among all psychiatric conditions, it is most commonly seen in Schizophrenia. It can be experienced in various modalities such as auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, somatic, and tactile. Such symptoms are often missed due to the patient’s feeling of embarrassment as well as the clinician’s indifference to elicit such psychopathology. However, these may form part of residual symptoms in Schizophrenia, which may increase the burden of disability and, therefore, contribute to its chronic, unremitting course. Such symptoms can be attributed to the dopamine rush in the mesolimbic pathway, and thus, antipsychotic drugs are the treatment of choice. Usually, most cases are found to be associated with a history of childhood sexual trauma, which needs to be addressed for focused psychotherapy. In this article, we have described three cases of Schizophrenia who presented with sexual hallucinations in the absence of any comorbid medical or psychiatric illness and showed response to various dosages of Olanzapine. Two of them had complete remission of sexual hallucinations, and one had near-complete resolution. All three patients returned to their normal functioning during treatment with a variable period of treatment with olanzapine and/or psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

      "abstract": "While pain has traditionally been understood within a medical model that equates pain to tissue damage or disease, this understanding is not consistent with everyday observations of pain or with clinical examples of persistent pain where there is often very little correlation between pain experienced and physical findings. This article considers psychological and multidimensional theories of pain, which are described within the historical context within which they were developed, including behavioural, cognitive, contextual and functional theories. Research into the multifactorial nature of persistent pain has tended to focus on mechanisms of pain development and maintenance or on the function of pain. Psychological approaches, which have focused on mechanism traditionally use disability, mood and quality of life measures to assess outcome, claiming little or no impact on pain intensity itself. By contrast, functional approaches include an explicit goal of reducing pain intensity, which is therefore measured as a key treatment outcome. Strong evidence exists from a range of sources of the important contribution of psychological and social factors to the experience of pain. However, evidence is still lacking about the specific mechanisms of change that are targeted by biopsychosocial interventions and about what treatment approach is likely to work best for whom.",

Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "Sexual activity is no more physically demanding or harmful than other activities involving the same level of exercise and emotion. As a general rule, sexual activity can be resumed when the patient can walk a kilometre at a comfortable pace or climb two flights of stairs without undue breathlessness. Sexual patterns and positions used prior to the heart attack should be continued. Symptoms that occur during sexual intercourse or any other exercise should be reported to a doctor. Taking more than two alcoholic drinks or eating a large meal may hinder sexual activity. Psychological problems that interfere with sexual function can develop in patients or their partners. Anxiety and depression are the most common causes of reduced libido, impotence and frigidity. Some people abandon sex after a heart attack because they feel they have aged significantly as a result of their illness. Doctors should ask post-myocardial infarction patients about sexual activity when inquiring about other symptoms and well-being. Given support, understanding and attendance to any associated problems, most patients will recover their normal sexual function after a heart attack. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

An illustration is the depressed phase of manic depressive psychosis which is frequently accompanied by periodic tachycardia, amenorrhea or loss of weight. The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently. This maintains that repeated emotional or psychologic stress may actually produce certain somatic diseases, such as asthma, essential hypertension or eczematoid dermatitis.

During preparation for competitions of various levels, the Olympic Games, world championships, continental championships, city competitions, athletes are \"accompanied\" by mental and emotional tension. Accordingly, when being in a given state of stress, corresponding negative disturbances appear in the performed sports activity. In general, stress is a fairly common and common phenomenon. Minor stresses are inevitable and harmless, but excessive stress creates problems for both individuals and organizations in accomplishing tasks. Psychologists believe that a person suffers more and more often from insults inflicted on him, a sense of his own insecurity, uncertainty about the future. There are two main groups of stress factors that most significantly affect the results of sports activities and are most often encountered: pre-competitive and competitive. Competitive stressors are stressors related directly to the sporting situation the athlete finds themselves in. Essentially, they are the most obvious stressors and are most directly linked to what happens during training or in a game. Organizational stressors can be attributed to, and therefore solved by, the coaching and organizational set up surrounding a team. The athlete needs to be helped to identify actions aimed at improving performance. Success in reaching sports peaks depends on the individual psychological characteristics of the athlete, and certain types of sports make demands and at the same time form personal qualities that are necessary for successful competitive activities. Each athlete is different, and their response to these competitive stressors will vary too. Finding the sweet spot where these stressors are contributing to an engaged, locked-in mindset can be the difference come crunch time. Knowing when a competitive stressor is overwhelming an athlete and having a detrimental affect can be an important preventative measure to avoid further issues down the road.",

In addition to that, heart function, emotions, moods etc. could be mentioned as the results of gradual aging. Such conditions are usually accompanied with increase in medications consumption and decline in quality of life. Though usually medical sciences study mental health conditions, sociology also needs to be applied to appraise the \"cause and effect\" of mental health. As life expectancy is globally increasing, more and more people are subject to mental disorders, Alzheimer's disorders, dementia, depression and many more, as the effects of aging extensively impact mental health. Therefore, under the conditions of rapid aging, geriatrics needs to be strengthened and improved as much as possible to safeguard mental health. However, structural changes in terms of biological, physical, psychological and chemical reactions which inevitably occur with aging, need prevention and appropriate medication, and other investments in long term, and if not, other vulnerabilities will inevitably appear.",

      "title": "General features of motor fatigue a review",
      "abstract": "Summary Fatigue is an ubiquitous phenomenon that has many definitions, and it is always multidimensional comprising physiological and psychological aspects. It ranges from a chronic symptom in somatic and psychiatric disorders to time-related physiological alterations of primary cortical areas, and to efferent and afferent pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) in healthy exercise physiology. Thus, it is necessary to define the context when referring to fatigue. Fatigue can generally be defined as a difficulty in initiating or sustaining a voluntary activity, the latter also being named fatigability in a more strict sense of nomenclature. Fatigue in a clinical setting is best quantified by means of self-reported questionnaires, for example the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The discrimination of accounts of depression, sleepiness, weakness, exercise intolerance and exhaustion relies however on a focused interview, clinical signs, and on the use of additional para-clinical investigations. Time-related physiological alterations during fatiguing tasks can occur at spinal and supraspinal sites, termed central fatigue, as well as at the neuro-muscular junction and in muscle fibres, termed peripheral fatigue. In exercise physiology, both central and peripheral fatigu ec an be assessed by electrophysiological techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, electromyography), pharmacological intervention, functional magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory tests. In the myriad of neurological disorders that cause fatigue, ranging from chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple sclerosis to neuro-muscular disorders and myopathy, different sites of pathological alterations are involved, all yielding to a patient complaining about excessive fatigue. This links the different aspects of fatigue, thus always calling for a multidimensional assessment of this intriguing phenomenon.",

      "title": "Physical Activity, Stress Reactivity, and Stress-Mediated Pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Patients with chronic pain are more likely to be sedentary and less likely to engage in regular physical activity or exercise than their healthy peers. Although individuals with chronic pain report many of the same obstacles to physical activity as healthy people, they also often attribute their lack of activity to disability or pain as a result of their condition and a fear of exacerbating symptoms. This perspective could be particularly detrimental for these individuals as their low levels of activity and large amounts of sedentary time put them at a greater risk for worsening their disability (McCracken & Samuel, 2007), as well as other medical conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and stroke. This process has been characterized by some as a vicious cycle; these patients are inactive, at least in part, as a result of their pain condition, which leads to greater disability, which in turn decreases the likelihood of them being physically active (Leeuw et al., 2007). The relatively low level of activity in these patients is especially troubling when considering the large and growing body of evidence demonstrating that exercise and increased levels of daily physical activity can provide benefits to individuals with chronic pain beyond enhanced physical fitness. The benefits of regular exercise for these patients may include improvements in pain symptoms, physical and functional capacity, fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, and quality of life. For low to moderate intensity prescriptions, the consensus appears to be that chronic pain patients can engage in exercise safely and without fear of exacerbating symptoms. Clinicians, for the most part, no longer subscribe to the view that rest and activity avoidance are the best methods of managing chronic pain symptoms. In fact, following decades of research, a recommendation for exercise or increased physical activity has become a standard element of multicomponent therapies for all manner of chronic pain conditions (Iversen, 2012).",

      "title": "THE CONTINUUM: SOMATIC DISTRESS TO MEDICALIZATION IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT",
      "abstract": "The sequence of stress, distress and somatization has occupied much of the late twentieth-century psychological research. The anatomy of stress can be viewed from interactional and hybrid theories that suggest that the individual relates with the surroundings by buffering the harmful effects of stressors. These acts or reactions are called coping strategies and are designed as protection from the stressors and adaptation to them. Failure to successfully adapt to stressors results in psychological distress. In some individuals, elevated levels of distress and failed coping are expressed in physical symptoms, rather than through feelings, words, or actions. Such “somatization” defends against the awareness of the psychological distress, as demonstrated in the psychosocial literature. The progression of behavior resulting from somatic distress moves from a private domain into the public arena, involving an elaborate medicalization process, is however less clear in sociological discourse. The invocation of a medical diagnosis to communicate physical discomfort by way of repeated use of health care services poses a major medical, social and economic problem. The goal of this paper is to clarify this connection by investigating the relevant literature in the area of women with breast cancer. This manuscript focuses on the relationship of psychological stress, the stress response of distress, and the preoccupation with one’s body, and proposes a new theoretical construct.",

Nowadays, anxiety and its associated problems are among the most common psychiatric syndromes in all over the world. It is believed that this syndrome affects approximately 25 percent of the general population. Hence, the present study attempts to find out the major causes of depression under anxiety particularly for the women section because women are mostly having depression, which is affected by their anxiety. With the rapid growth of industrialization and modernization in the country, there is also a rapid increase in the rate of violence against women, which has directly or indirectly contributed to the rise of mental health problems.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of major depressive episode in the elderly leads to impairment on several aspects of daily life, including life quality, morbid - mortality and increases rates of suicide risks. Stress and life events are frequent triggers of depressive episode in elderly. The present review aimed to explore the aspects related to the onset of depression in old age, focusing on psychosocial and stress. In order to achieve that, we systematically reviewed papers published in the Medline database from 2003-2013. From this study, we verify that depression in the elderly is a complex disorder, more often associated to psychosocial aspects and chronic stress than to genetic and biomarkers. Loneliness, daily and chronic stress, lack of social support, mourning and economical aspects such as retirement and job loss are major risk factors for depression. Generally, negative life events were noticed to cause poorer mental health in advanced age and cumulative stressful events or traumas untreated too. Furthermore, cognitive functions may be affected negatively by lifelong chronic stressors. These events can cause quite a few different impacts in distinct cultures and lifestyles. The consequences also depend on the duration, or on the life period that these episodes occur. The treatment of depression in the elderly should target both medication and psychotherapy in order to account for psychological aspects, especially treatments based on life review. These perspectives are important due to the possibility of development of specific target strategies in order to prevent those risk factors and improve quality of life in elderly. Many points were contradictorily related, overdue the papers had noticed different conclusions about the same studied points. Face of this, we grouped relevant articles with the same results. Notwithstanding, there were points that require more studies, considering the relevance of the theme.",

Patient concerns: Forty-one year old patient complained from feeling cold after breast cancer surgery. Diagnoses: The diagnoses of fibromyalgia, depression, neurological, psychiatric, and vascular disorders were excluded by appropriate clinical and laboratory investigations. She was diagnosed as CFS. Interventions: The patient was treated successfully via aerobic exercise therapy that scheduled for 30 min at least 3 days per week. Outcomes: At 6-month follow-up, her complaints were almost resolved and the patient regained her physical health and mental attitude. Lessons: A thermal dysregulation should be taken into consideration as one of the symptoms of CFS.",

Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "In the modern world, anxiety is an important part of life. Physiological anxiety is a normal emotional response to stress, a biological response to a threat. Anxiety allows you to protect yourself and your loved ones from harm and prepare for significant events, and also serves as an important signal to take strong action in a stressful situation. The study and understanding of the specifics of the clinical structure, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders in persons who have suffered as a result of hostilities is indeed the main concern for social and medical issues of our society. As the results of the study showed, patients most often complain of the following symptoms: the affect of longing (boredom, despondency, sadness, sorrow), depressed mood, a feeling of tension, danger and tightness, difficulties in adapting to new surroundings, anxiety over small things, irritability and impatience, lack of hope and prospects, internal tension with the inability to relax, a sense of loss of control over one's life, obsessive fears, sleep disorders, psycho-traumatic memories, fears and fixation on subjectively significant negative information about events in the occupied territories. In the clinical structure of post-traumatic stress disorders in the examined patients, it was found: post-traumatic stress disorder (F43.1), adjustment disorders (prolonged anxiety-depressive reaction) (F43.21), anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (F41.1) and panic disorder (F41.0). The data obtained became the basis for the development of a comprehensive personalized program for the correction of anxiety disorders and rehabilitation of persons with forced displacement. The personalized program was with differentiated use of methods of psychopharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychoeducation. Keywords: biosugestive therapy, anxiety, depression, correction programs.",

      "abstract": "How can death during police restraint be explained when the pathologist finds no structural or anatomic lesions to explain death? This is not an easy question to answer. When an in-custody restraint death occurs, there is a close physical and temporal association between the restraint process and the death that follows. Because of this, it is tempting to attribute the cause of death to the restraint procedure itself. However, this is an error of logic: the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc, which is Latin for \"after this therefore because of this.\" This error in logic may mislead death investigators into building a case centered on the deadly effects of police restraint procedures and prevent consideration of other mechanisms and causes of death that occur contemporaneous with restraint. One such cause is cardiorespiratory arrest caused by the acute stress response occurring during police restraint. This cause of sudden death is unpredictable and rare, and results from a combination of individual perception of the threat posed by the restraint events and maladaptive pathophysiology of the acute stress response. This chapter examines the mechanisms, physiology, and medical issues associated with the acute stress response.",

      "title": "Evaluación de funciones cognitivas: atención y memoria en pacientes con trastorno de pánico",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered an important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas. On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk. PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control. In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities. One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes. Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry «Ramon de la Fuente» in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions. We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory. Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck’s Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms. The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p<0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12. The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control. According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls. In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency. This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder. In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations. Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.",

      "title": "Is musical hallucination an otological phenomenon? a review of the literature",
      "abstract": "Background: Musical hallucination is the subjective experience of hearing music, or aspects of music, when none is being played, and as such is a disorder of the processing of complex sounds. Objective of Review: To determine the extent to which the otological system is responsible for musical hallucination, and to evaluate approaches to clinical management. Type of Review: A review of all studies and literature reviews pertaining to musical hallucination, supplemented by inclusion of informative case reports. Search Strategy: A systematic search of multiple databases carried out on 22nd March 2009 was complemented by referral to the reference lists of included manuscripts. Results: Although not always troublesome in itself, musical hallucination can be a marker of underlying pathology in the ear or brain, or indicate obsessive‐compulsive traits or social isolation, and is likely to be clinically underreported. Associations have been reported with hearing loss, female gender, social isolation and being over 60 years of age, although it is rare even in this group, and these may well not be independent risk factors. Robust comparative analysis of these factors with controls has yet to be undertaken. Underlying causes include neurovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders and opioid medications, however these are absent in the majority of cases. Conclusions: This review supports the proposal that the otological system plays a role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucination. Hearing impairment may act as an initiating factor, and the primary dysfunction is overactivity of auditory association cortex, although an impairment of higher‐level inhibition does also seem necessary. Once underlying sinister causes have been excluded, first line treatment should be explanation of the condition and optimisation of hearing. Medications have a role only in selected patient groups.",

Our patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who had been working in a company for around 33 years and always had good appraisals. He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness. His delusions did not respond to conventional treatment with psychotropic medication possibly due to non-adherence because of side effects. However, a series of venesections lead to an improvement in mental state.",

Despite the experimental work which has been reported on the subject there is little accurate knowledge concerning the essential basis of the phenomena of sleep or concerning the real effects of disturbances of the rhythm of sleep. Stories concerning death produced by continued wakefulness or of mental disease produced by long vigils have been current for many years. There are, however, no actually observed cases recorded in the medical literature which clearly indicate that extended vigils produce either mental disease or death. Normal sleep is disturbed in various organic conditions of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis, meningitis, concussion and dementia paralytica, as well as in the functional psychoses, in manic-depressive psychosis and in schizophrenia.

      "title": "Pain in Animals and Humans: An Introduction",
      "abstract": "No issue in animal research is more sensitive than that of inducing distress in animals. Both the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research Extension Act (1985) require special justification and committee approval before research likely to produce distress in animals is performed. It is therefore imperative that investigators carefully review all aspects of their proposed investigations, with the intention of reducing or eliminating factors that may lead to distress. A variety of factors contribute to distress in the research setting. These factors are commonly termed stressors and are known to elicit typical physiological and/or biochemical responses, for example, stimulation of the adrenocortical axis. While exposure to some stressful events is necessary for normal development, it is the abnormal response to these events, distress, that should be avoided. Whether or not an animal responds to a stressor by manifesting signs of distress depends on the duration and intensity of the stressor as well as the animal's previous experience. One signal of distress, sometimes the only sign, is maladaptive behavior. As a result, special attention must be given to species typical behaviors and abnormalities in these behaviors when attempting to assess the presence or absence of distress. One well recognized stressor is pain. While many scientific investigations can adequately avoid pain, a few types of experiments, especially those involved with testing analgesics, may induce pain. It is particularly important in these studies that the methods chosen appropriately simulate the condition under study in man, that the intensity and duration of the stimulus be the minimum necessary to generate scientifically valid results, and that special attention be given throughout the study to assess the presence of distress in the animal. Animals involved in studies that may lead to severe or chronic pain that is not expected to be relieved by analgesics should be euthanized during or at the conclusion of the procedure. With this in mind, we have invited a number of investigators to submit manuscripts dealing with pain and its assessment and alleviation in humans and nonhuman animals.

      "abstract": "Physical fitness, achieved through regular exercise and/or spontaneous physical activity, confers resilience by inducing positive psychological and physiological benefits, blunting stress reactivity, protecting against potentially adverse behavioural and metabolic consequences of stressful events and preventing many chronic diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical fitness on mental and physical health. Physical fitness appears to buffer against stress-related disease owing to its blunting/optimizing effects on hormonal stress responsive systems, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. This blunting appears to contribute to reduced emotional, physiological and metabolic reactivity as well as increased positive mood and well-being. Another mechanism whereby regular exercise and/or physical fitness may confer resilience is through minimizing excessive inflammation. Chronic psychological stress, physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity have been associated with persistent, systemic, low-grade inflammation and exert adverse effects on mental and physical health. The anti-inflammatory effects of regular exercise/activity can promote behavioural and metabolic resilience, and protect against various chronic diseases associated with systemic inflammation. Moreover, exercise may benefit the brain by enhancing growth factor expression and neural plasticity, thereby contributing to improved mood and cognition. In summary, the mechanisms whereby physical fitness promotes increased resilience and well-being and positive psychological and physical health are diverse and complex.",

When stress becomes a prolonged or chronic experience, it can result in psychological distress, including generalized anxiety, burnout, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety, fatigue, burnout, and depression are familiar examples of \"distress\" and evidence has demonstrated that they are associated with prolonged exposure to stressful work. Many studies have shown an association between job strain and some form of psychological distress. Several other studies that have measured job strain and anxiety, often as part of a battery of \"psychological distress\" domains, have shown a positive correlation between high job strain and anxiety. Work-related stress can also be a factor in exacerbating pre-existing mental illnesses and may even precipitate clinically diagnosable symptoms of depression. The work environment is filled with challenges that provoke \"stress\" and engage our adaptive coping abilities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Despite 50 years of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions schizophrenia remains one of the leading causes of disability. The inability to function in everyday settings includes deficits in performance of social, occupational, and independent living activities. Schizophrenia is also a life-shortening illness, caused mainly by poor physical health and its complications. Dysfunctional lifestyles including sedentary behavior and lack of physical activity prevail, while treatment with adipogenic antipsychotic medication interacts with poor performance in screening, monitoring, and intervention that result in shortening of life expectancies by 25–30 years. Disability interferes with self-care and medical care, further worsening physical health to produce a vicious cycle of disability. Further, the neurobiological impact of obesity on brain functioning is substantial and relevant to schizophrenia. Decision making deficits that lead to choices resulting in obesity themselves have neurobiological determinants. Simultaneous treatment of cognitive deficits and related deficits in functional skills, ubiquitous determinants of everyday functioning in schizophrenia, and targeted interventions aimed at poor physical health, especially obesity and associated comorbidities, may lead to additive or even interactive gains in everyday functioning in patients with schizophrenia not previously realized with other interventions.",

Common comorbidities include endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, migraine, anxiety, multiple chemical sensitivity and autoimmune diseases. Chronic pain may lead to depression, which often results in social isolation. Chronic pain can only be explained and treated successfully if a person is seen as a biopsychosocial entity. Interrelations between a person and their environment are of central importance for the maintenance of health and the development of disease. The fact that the pain is located in the urogenital area makes the situation even more delicate. In this location, we find the functions of excretion, reproduction und sexual desire - a constellation that predisposes to a high incidence of psychosomatic events. This means that urogenital pain not only involves an unpleasant sensory experience but also feelings of fear, guilt, shame and impotence.Das Risiko von Komorbiditäten chronischer Schmerzstörungen ist bei IC/BPS Patienten höher als in der gesunden Population.

Wechselbeziehungen zwischen Umwelt und Individuum sind von zentraler Bedeutung für die Aufrechterhaltung der Gesundheit sowie die Entstehung und den Verlauf der Krankheit.

Diese Konstellation prädisponiert zu hoher Anfälligkeit für ein psychosomatisches Geschehen.

People who have been traumatized often present with distressing and frequently intractable psychosomatic symptoms, often without knowing consciously that the source of their symptoms is the trauma they experienced. The stress response may be considered to exist along a continuum: eustress, stress, and traumatic stress. Traumatic stress precipitates a condition of physiological and psychobiological imbalance in the nervous system and in the endocrine, immune, and neuropeptide systems. Some evidence suggests that discrimination may constitute a stressor and contribute to a greater lifetime allostatic load. Conversely, social relationships mitigate the effects of allostatic load. This intersects with a new model of stress response called \"tend and befriend.\" Learned helplessness intersects with the central assertion of state-dependent memory, learning, and behavior: what we learn and remember is dependent on our psychophysiological state at the time of the experience.",

It is treated at departments of physical medicine, such as dental, oral and maxillofacial surgery, otolaryngology, cerebral surgery, or head and neck surgery. In primary care, it is considered to be a medically unexplained symptom (MUS), or a somatoform disorder, such as somatization caused by a functional somatic syndrome (FSS) by psychiatrists. Usually, patients consult departments of physical medicine complaining of physical pain. Therefore physicians in these departments should examine the patients from the holistic perspective, and identify organic diseases. As atypical facial pain becomes chronic, other complications, including psychiatric complaints other than physical pain, such as depression may develop. Moreover, physical, psychological, and social factors affect the symptoms by interacting with one another. Therefore, in examining atypical facial pain, doctors specializing in dental, oral and maxillofacial medicine are required to provide psychosomatic treatment that is based on integrated knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of epilepsy is a complex and evolving field, reflecting both rapid developments in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, and the continued difficulties in translating electrical and functional phenomena into traditional categories of morphological disease. A seizure is an acute neurological event due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of neurons.1 Lesions that are presumed to cause seizures can be either structural, definable by morphological techniques such as radiology and anatomic pathology, or functional, definable by clinical localization, electrophysiology, and, in some cases, functional imaging defining a focus. Causality is inferred by correlation of morphological findings and location with clinical and electrophysiological data and, in some cases, by the cessation of subsequent seizures after removal of the lesion or focus. Epilepsy is intermittent recurrence of seizures. The finding of structural lesions in some forms of epilepsy suggests and supports causality, but our understanding of the chain between the definable structural lesion and the recurrence of seizures is often less clear.2 Causality may be particularly difficult to determine in conditions producing multiple structural lesions such as tuberous sclerosis, where one lesion is epileptogenic and other similar lesions are not. Even determining how a particular electrically active focus propagates to evolve into a particular seizure or series of intractable seizures is also incompletely understood. To add to the difficulty, seizures or epilepsy itself can be causal, resulting in progressive brain damage and self-perpetuating seizures, particularly in some forms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, some treatments for epilepsy themselves have been associated with some forms of brain damage.",

      "title": "Somatoform Disorders",
      "abstract": "Around the world, physical symptoms are the most common manifestation of psychological distress. This seeming contradiction presents a diagnostic challenge for health care professionals who are consulted to provide treatment and illness management. In many situations, it is difficult to clearly identify the psychological cause of physical symptoms, and, at times, it is equally difficult to exclude the possibility of an underlying biomedical process. This clinical challenge has led to the construction of the diagnostic category of somatoform disorders, a group of psychiatric disorders characterized by the presence of physical symptoms causing significant distress or functional impairment that cannot be fully explained by a general medical condition, substance use, or any other mental disorder. This category of disorders was established based on clinical utility and the need to exclude medical causes in health care settings rather than on a theoretical model of psychopathology or shared etiology. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association 2000, cited under Classification), the somatoform disorders include somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and somatoform disorder not otherwise specified. Some authors prefer other terminology, including use of the terms medically unexplained symptoms, emphasizing the uncertainty about diagnosis, or functional somatic syndromes, suggesting that symptoms are due to disturbances in the function of psychophysiological systems rather than structural or anatomical pathology.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

She was very much concerned about the behavioural issues and wellbeing of her elder son since 12 years. According to the informant, the patient was having increased tension, repeated talking about her elder son, making loud noises and suicidal thoughts. Also, she had an attempt to suicide. She was treated on an IP level with a combination of Ayurvedic internal medications and Panchakarma procedures. The treatment protocol includes Snehapana, Virecana, Nasya, Shirodhara, and Dhoopana.

      "abstract": "Chronische Erschöpfung lässt sich aufgrund vorliegender Befunde zu konstitutionellen Voraussetzungen, auslösenden und aufrechterhalten Bedingungen als eine funktionelle Störung beschreiben. Im Sinne einer medizinisch-psychiatrischen Interfaceerkrankung kann sie so schlüssig und therapierelevant eingeordnet werden. Subsyndromale kürzer dauernde Episoden chronischer Erschöpfung sind um ein vielfaches häufiger als die mindestens drei bzw. sechs Monate anhaltenden Diagnosekategorien «Neurasthenie» und «Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrom». Diese weisen große Ähnlichkeit miteinander auf und beschreiben offenbar denselben Sachverhalt. Ursprüngliche ätiologische Annahmen haben sich hier als empirisch nicht belegbar erwiesen. Jedoch bestehen bei Betroffenen in somatischer Hinsicht insbesondere Veränderungen neurohumeraler und immunologischer Wechselwirkungen, die auf eine hohe Bedeutung einer für funktionelle Syndrome charakteristisch veränderten HPA-Stressachsenaktivität bzw. deren Wechselwirkung mit anderen Regulationssystemen hinweisen. Auch eine erhöhte Sensitivierung auf neuronaler und neurokognitiver Ebene scheint der Fall zu sein. Eine erhöhte kritische Aufmerksamkeitszuwendung auf körperliche Funktionen und dysfunktionale Bewältigungsweisen sind zumindest aufrechterhaltende chronifizierende Faktoren, wie bei anderen funktionellen Störungen auch. Wobei diese Dysfunktionalität sowohl beim Betroffenen, wie auch beim Behandler bestehen kann. Die eine und spezifische Ursache chronischer Erschöpfungssyndrome gibt es offenbar nicht, jedoch bieten die genannten Gemeinsamkeiten Ansatzpunkte für eine positive therapeutische Beeinflussung. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass sich nur Therapieansätze als wirksam erweisen, die eine aktive Rolle der Betroffenen einfordern. Medikamentöse Behandlung in Form der Gabe von SSRI-Antidepressiva kann augmentativ von Nutzen sein. Passive Therapieansätze zeigen bislang keine nachweisbare Wirkung.",

      "title": "Obsessive-compulsive spectrum – review of the construct",
      "abstract": "Introduction Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a clinical syndrome whose hallmarks are excessive, anxiety-evoking thoughts and compulsive behaviours that are generally recognized as unreasonable, but which cause significant distress and impairment. OCD may also occur in the context of other neuropsychiatric disorders, most commonly other anxiety and mood disorders. The question remains as to whether these combinations of disorders should be regarded as independent, cooccurring disorders or as different manifestations of an incompletely understood constellation of OCD spectrum disorders with a common aetiology. Objectives To review critically whether there is a robust basis for the concept of an obsessive–compulsive (OC) spectrum of disorders, and if so, which disorders should be included. Methods Literature review performed on PubMed and Google Scholar databases, using the keywords “obsessive–compulsive disorder”, “obsessive–compulsive spectrum”, “body dysmorphic disorder”, “hypochondriasis”, “trichotillomania”, “psychiatry”. Results Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) itself is a heterogeneous condition or group of conditions, and this needs to be appreciated in any articulation of a ‘spectrum’ of OC disorders. The basis for ‘membership’ of the spectrum is inconsistent and varied, with varying level of support for inclusion in the putative spectrum. Conclusions A more fruitful approach may be to consider behaviours and dimensions in OCD and OC spectrum disorders, and that this should be encompassed in further developments of the OC spectrum model.

      "abstract": "A non-reversible obstructive inflammatory process of the small airways and destruction of the alveolar walls characterizes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

      "abstract": "With the recent development of sleep medicine, insomnia has been perceived as a disease from a simple symptom. As there are various causes in a disease, proper treatment according to each cause is necessary for a more effective treatment In general, insomnia is classified into five categrories of physical, physiological, psychological, psychiatric and pharmacological aspects. However, such categorizations are often insufficient in treating insomnia. Furthermore understanding of the developmental mechanisms of insomnia is required. The function of sleep is developed and maintained through the balance of the reciprocal forces of sleep and arousal. These forces are contantly regulated by what is called a circadian rhythm. Sleep is induced by this rhythm which is affected by factors such as awakening time in the morning, amount of intellectual function, amount and time length of physical exercise and sunlight Insomnia could develop when this rhythm is delayed and leads to a forbidden zone which is a very difficult period for inducing sleep about two to four hours before the routine bedtime. Whereas sleep gradually develops in line with the circardian rhythm, arousal can occur very abruptly by any cause triggered by emotional discomfort or anxiety. Such characteristic and emotional factors as perfectionism, separation anxiety, secondary gain, insecurity, and negative cognition may provoke the inner anxiety and fear for insomnia, which can lead acute insomnia to a chronic one. As chronic insomnia is developed by multiple causes and factors, integrated approaches through analysis of above mentioned factors will be more effective in the treatment of insomnia than a simple administration of hypnotics.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "Die Depression in der Postpartalzeit: eine diagnostische und therapeutische Herausforderung",
      "abstract": "Postpartum is not a specific entity. There is neither a very specific psychopathology nor evidence for a specific aetiology. The prevalence of severe is not significantly enhanced in the year as compared to women of the same age group without delivery who have quite a high prevalence of anyway. Incidence of milder might slightly be enhanced in the first weeks. Giving birth and adapting to the new mother role seem to be stressors contributing to the outbreak of in vulnerable, predisposed women or to enhance pre-existing depression. Biological, especially hormonal, as well as psychosocial factors can be relevant stressors in this situation. Although this is not a specific entity, the diagnostic term or specifier postpartum depression might still be justified, as in early motherhood shows many important specifities. Diagnosis is especially difficult, as women, due to shame, stigma and many fears, do not seek help and doctors, due to misinterpretation of symptoms, often do not recognise the severity of the situation. Untreated, these disorders can have especially severe consequences, not only for the mother, but also for the child and the whole family. These disorders therefore need our special attention and special treatment. This means modifications of our pharmacological, non-pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment methods. Therapy - although in principle the same as that of other depressive disorders - has to put a special emphasis on the needs of the period. Education about the fact that this is a disease and not due to failure as a mother is of utmost importance to relieve the patients from feelings of guilt. Counselling and practical advice for the mother and her family is often needed as well as the help of a midwife, a family nurse, a social worker and/or other health care professionals. A good mother-infant bonding should be a main concern from the start. This means that the mother should not be separated from her infant for longer periods of time. However, she needs a lot of help in order to allow for relaxed contacts with the infant. Pharmacological treatment is often complicated by the patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of antidepressant treatment during lactation as regards the potential side effects and/or long-term consequences for the infant. On the other hand, the risks of ongoing severe are generally regarded as higher than the potential risks of medication. Thus, if a mother insists on breast-feeding, she has to be educated about side effects and the baby has to be carefully monitored. Several studies have in the meantime also shown positive effects of oestrogen substitution and non-pharmacological treatments such as bright-light therapy. Psychotherapy should be initiated as soon as possible and be very supportive in the beginning. Specific manualised forms of psychotherapy for women with have also shown very promising results. In the future, more emphasis should be laid on prophylaxis, specific education and the broad implementation of low-threshold services. Under all circumstances, special attention must be given to the mother-child-relationship, on the one hand to reduce feelings of guilt in the mother and thereby to enhance the process of healing, on the other hand to prevent traumatisation of the infant and to avoid deleterious long-term consequences.",

This theoretical condition tangentially explains the loss of professional efficacy and became a quasi-clinical concept. Nevertheless, burnout questionnaires do not measure loss of professional efficacy. The attribution of this loss remains understudied. Some allege that over 50% of therapists and health workers suffer from burnout, but these results warrant scepticism on account of the overlap with loss of motivation. A main prodromal factor in the loss of professional efficacy is a loss of motivation or «disenchantment», possibly caused by occupational boredom. A sequence boredom loss of motivation burnout means that therapist efficacy loss depends on continuing professional education (CPE) and peer monitoring. Self-monitoring for motivation is important.

      "title": "Complex regional pain syndrome–up-to-date",
      "abstract": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) was described for the first time in the 19th century by Silas Weir Mitchell. After the exclusion of other causes, CRPS is characterised by a typical clinical constellation of pain, sensory, autonomic, motor, or trophic symptoms which can no longer be explained by the initial trauma. These symptoms spread distally and are not limited to innervation territories. If CRPS is not improved in the acute phase and becomes chronic, the visible symptoms change throughout because of the changing pathophysiology; the pain, however, remains. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, although in complex cases further technical examination mainly for exclusion of alternative diagnoses is warranted. In the initial phase, the pathophysiology is dominated by a posttraumatic inflammatory reaction by the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system. In particular, without adequate treatment, central nociceptive sensitization, reorganisation, and implicit learning processes develop, whereas the inflammation moderates. The main symptoms then include movement disorders, alternating skin temperature, sensory loss, hyperalgesia, and body perception disturbances. Psychological factors such as posttraumatic stress or pain-related fear may impact the course and the treatability of CRPS. The treatment should be ideally adjusted to the pathophysiology. Pharmacological treatment maybe particularly effective in acute stages and includes steroids, bisphosphonates, and dimethylsulfoxide cream. Common anti-neuropathic pain drugs can be recommended empirically. Intravenous long-term ketamine administration has shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials, but its repeated application is demanding and has side effects. Important components of the treatment include physio- and occupational therapy including behavioural therapy (eg, graded exposure in vivo and graded motor imaging). If psychosocial comorbidities exist, patients should be appropriately treated and supported. Invasive methods should only be used in specialised centres and in carefully evaluated cases. Considering these fundamentals, CRPS often remains a chronic pain disorder but the devastating cases should become rare.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fatigue is a symptom whose causes are protean and whose phenotype includes physical, mood, and behavioral components. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness that has strong biological underpinnings and no definite etiology. Diagnostic criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have helped classify CFS as an overlap of mood, behavioral, and biological components. These include the presence of fatigue for more than 6 months associated with a diminution of functional activity and somatic symptoms, and pain not attributable to a specific diagnosis or disease. Four of the following criteria need to be present: sore throat, impaired memory or cognition, unrefreshing sleep, postexertional fatigue, tender glands, aching stiff muscles, joint pain, and headaches. Many researchers have observed that CFS shares features in common with other somatic syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Correlations between inflammation and infection, augmented sensory processing, abnormalities of neurotransmitters, nerve growth factors, low levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, abnormalities of homeostasis of the stress system, and autonomic dysfunction may be hallmarks of CFS. The relative contributions of each of these abnormalities to the profound fatigue associated with CFS need to be explored further to better evaluate and treat the syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

The second part of the chapter has focused on three specific neurological entities to examine evidence for a possible association between neurological illness and life stress. There is some suggestion that certain vulnerable epileptic patients can experience convulsions in response to acute emotional upheaval or certain types of cognitive challenges. More commonly, it is probable that social stress and emotional tension can produce lowering of seizure threshold by increasing levels of fatigue and disrupting sleep. The latter factor, in particular, is known to lower seizure threshold. In the case of stroke, several dramatic cases of intracranial hemorrhage have been related to disastrous life circumstances. A general association between life stress and stroke has yet to be established. The case for a link between life events and onset of exacerbation of multiple sclerosis seems stronger. Events which produce emotional upset seem capable of worsening symptoms in patients with existing disease, and several studies have reported unusual life stresses in the period preceding onset of symptoms in this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Seeing domestic violence and abuse through a psychological lens can entail considering violence as a trauma and being concerned with its potential effect on mental health. As a traumatic event, domestic violence can be described as severe. It commonly persists over time, contains multiple types of violence, and takes place within a significant relationship, which may limit the possibility to escape and involve betrayal. Mental health consequences of domestic violence can be severe and complex, sometimes including symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or substance abuse disorders. For children, an additional problem is that domestic violence may interfere with their development and attachment. Cross-cultural research may elucidate the role of culture in domestic violence prevalence, mental health risk and coping. Not all survivors struggle with symptoms of mental health problems, and certain risk and protective factors may increase or decrease the risk. One potent risk factor for mental health problems is shame. As a social emotion, shame relates to negative beliefs and assumptions about violence and victims held by their social surroundings. Shame is thus not only a characteristic of the individual victim, but also of her/his social group, and society at large. The severity of potential mental health problems after experiences with violence means that many survivors may need psychological treatment. Various trauma-treatment models are effective in reducing symptoms. However, treatment is not available for all. New innovations, including online modules, show promise in making treatment more available for victims.",

      "abstract": "Study of the life settings in which patients fall ill reveals that illness is commonly preceded by a period of psychological disturbance, during which the individual feels unable to cope. This has been designated the giving-up—given-up complex and has the following five psychologic characteristics: a feeling of giving up, experienced as helplessness or hopelessness; a depreciated image of the self; a sense of loss of gratification from relationships or roles in life; a feeling of disruption of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and a reactivation of memories of earlier periods of giving-up. It is proposed that this state reflects the temporary failure of mental coping mechanisms with a consequent activation of neurally regulated biological emergency patterns. Changes in body economy so evoked may alter the organism's capability to deal with concurrent pathogenic processes, permitting disease to develop. As such, the giving-up—given-up complex is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for disease development, merely a contributing factor.",

Without a specific explanation for a patient's symptoms, the family physician is charged with providing reassurance, while also guiding the patient toward a return to function, which often includes maintaining employment. Evaluating for red flag signs and symptoms helps to eliminate concerning causes of low back pain, such as malignancy, fracture, infection, and cauda equina. Prescribing physical activity, including core strengthening, physical therapy, or yoga, is an important therapeutic intervention. Early return to work should be encouraged when appropriate. There is limited evidence to support workplace modification, medication, or steroid injection for nonspecific low back pain. Early assessment for barriers to recovery, such as fear avoidance beliefs and psychosocial factors, is helpful. Stress management counseling may also be beneficial. Disability guidelines can serve as guideposts for return to work recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Depression is considered as affective disorder characterized by change in mood, lack of interest in the surrounding. It is one of the mental health problems of people all over the world. Depression is a multifaceted condition characterised by episodes of mood disturbances alongside other symptoms such as anhedonia, psychomotor complaints, feelings of guilt and suicidal tendencies, all of which can range in severity. Anxiety and fear can be defined as response of subject to real or potential threats that may impair his/her homeostasis that can significantly mark function and quality of life. Some of depressive disorder overlap those of anxiety disorders, including severe phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety-related disorders such as patient’s nervousness, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress are foremost causes of infirmity in the world. Antidepressant and anxiolytic drug are the drug use for treatment of depression and anxiety but there are several side effect of these drug were observed like dry mouth, mental confusion, weakness and sedation. So, we evaluate the anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effect of N. Jatamansi root extract in rats by dose dependent manner. The behavior assessment observed by force swim test, locomotor activity, tail suspension test and elevated plus maze for depression and anxiety experimentation. The drug given 150mg/kg and 300mg/kg by oral route. The study observed that the ethanolic root extract reduced depression and anxiety generated by force swim test, tail suspension method, actophotometer and elevated plus maze.",

A 19‐year‐old male is reported who was assaulted and placed in a head‐down position in the back of a car were he was later found dead. Brush abrasions indicated that he had been dragged to the vehicle. The head and right shoulder were wedged into the foot well with the body uppermost. At autopsy, there was marked congestion of the face, neck, and upper chest with conjunctival ecchymoses, bruising of the face and scalp, focal subarachnoid hemorrhage, minor cerebral contusion, and diffuse cerebral swelling with early hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ). Toxicology was negative. Death was attributed to HIE resulting from the unusual positioning of the body. Cases of positional asphyxia involving others may not always include restraint, and when encountered should initiate a careful evaluation of the possible events and lethal pathophysiological processes.",

      "abstract": "Post-operative sleep disturbance, with suppression of rapid eye movement sleep and slow wave sleep followed by a subsequent rebound, seems to be related to the magnitude of trauma and thereby to the surgical stress response. In this context, cortisol, autonomic stimulation, and certain cytokines may lead to abnormal sleep. Furthermore, the environment, pain and the administration of analgesics seem to be important factors in the precipitation of sleep abnormalities. Post-operative sleep disturbance may contribute to the development of episodic hypoxaemia, haemodynamic instability and altered mental status, all of which have an influence on post-operative morbidity and mortality. Prevention or reduction of the post-operative sleep disturbance may be achieved by minimizing surgical trauma, changing the conventional nursing procedures, avoiding opioids and treating pain with non-opioid analgesics, although none of these methods has been thoroughly studied. Post-operative sleep disturbance represents an important research field, since it may have a significant adverse impact on post-operative outcome.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "abstract": "The influence of anxiety and depression on cardiovascular disease is well-known in terms of chronic cardiovascular and ischemic states. It happens mostly through diminished cardiac vagal modulation and greater procoagulant activity in depressed patients. But the impact of emotional factors in acute cardiac events is not estimated enough. From the clinician's point of view, there are an increasing awareness concerning external circumstances and external triggering in sudden cardiac death, that is caused by malignant ventricular arrhythmias or myocardial infarction. A number of external, i.e. exogenous factors in everyday life can be implicated in triggering such events. Including heavy physical activity, emotional stressors, meteorologic variables, air pollutants, chronobiologic phenomena, food ingestions, coffee, alcohol etc., emotional stress seems to be among the most often triggers of sudden event. There is a wide range of everyday situations and activities that involves activation of sympathetic nervous system, and emotional stressors are described as trigger caused by sympathetic arousal. Acute emotional arousal can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias and the mechanisms of that risk have been recognized. Acute episode of emotional distress (and notably anger-like stress) may trigger ventricular ectopic beats and tachycardia, as well as acute myocardial infarction. These sudden phenomena can be the result of the endogenous response to external risk of acute emotional stress. Sudden death without antecedent angina, suggesting cardiac arrhythmia, as well as deaths preceded by chest pain, suggesting coronary occlusion were observed in many studies that have led to estimates that between 20 and 40 percent of sudden cardiac deaths are precipitated by acute emotional stressors.",

The physical symptoms of psoriasis, namely pruritus, can contribute to disease-related psychosocial stress, although its role may be less prominent than other features. Psoriasis-induced stress can lead to a self-perpetuating problem as stress has been suggested to precipitate psoriasis flares. Small studies have shown improved response to phototherapy and increased remission duration when phototherapy is combined with a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), respectively. Cardiovascular comorbidity can contribute to impaired sexual functioning in patients with psoriasis as atherosclerosis can lead to erectile dysfunction.",

Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

      "abstract": "Burnout» is a syndrome consisting of physical and emotional exhaustion resulting from negative self-concept, negative job attitudes, and loss of concern for clients. This theoretical condi- tion tangentially explains the loss of professional efficacy and became a quasi-clinical concept. Nevertheless, burnout questionnaires do not measure loss of professional efficacy. The attribution of this loss remains understudied. Some allege that over 50% of therapists and health workers suf- fer from burnout, but these results warrant scepticism on account of the overlap with loss of moti- vation. A main prodromal factor in the loss of professional efficacy is a loss of motivation or «disenchantment», possibly caused by occupational boredom. A sequence boredom > loss of mo- tivation > burnout means that therapist efficacy loss depends on continuing professional education (CPE) and peer monitoring. Self-monitoring for motivation is important. National professional practice rules should be tuned to these requirements.",

There is a high association of co-morbid medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial disorders, as with chronic pain in general. Attention to history, especially onset and aggravating factors, can be crucial in identifying the etiology. Physical examination, including neurological and myofascial exam, can often provide important clues to identifying the most appropriate treatments. Many of the chronic facial pain syndromes are unique, given the complex anatomy and specialized sensory innervation of the head, face, and neck, and often pose diagnostic challenges. Due to the host of therapies available for facial pain it is imperative for the clinician to guide patients through therapeutic options to maximize treatment efficacy.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Multiple causes are not mutually exclusive, and a high background rate does not preclude associations with specific factors that are uncommon in the general population. MSDs have well-documented associations with occupational ergonomic stressors such as repetitive motion, heavy lifting, non-neutral postures, and vibration. Organizational features of the work environment, such as time pressure and low decision latitude, may also play a role, at least by potentiating the effects of physical loading. Numerous systematic reviews have mostly concurred with these overall findings. Nevertheless, some continue to debate whether MSDs are sometimes work-related, even for those performing jobs with repetitive and routinized tasks, heavy lifting, and/or pronounced postural strain. This article discusses (1) some epidemiologic features of MSDs that underlie that debate; and (2) the question of what should appropriately be considered a gold standard for scientific evidence on an etiological question such as the health effects of a non-voluntary exposure, such as an occupational or environmental agent. In particular, randomized clinical trials have little relevance for determining the health effects of non-therapeutic risk factors.",

In both cases, endurance limits are pushed, which leads to burnout and has consequences for the entire human body and psychophysical health. We live in a harsh age where it is not enough to be successful, the demand is to be the best. This ultimatum is particularly prominent in sports. Athletes are distinguished from others by discipline, perseverance, persistence, focus on the goal (victory), sacrifice and responsibility. Top fitness and top results are always expected from them.

      "title": "POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AS PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR TIME",
      "abstract": "The issue of combat-related psychological trauma and the development of post-traumatic disorders during wartime are of great significance now. The ongoing conflict with the invasion of neighbouring forces and the large-scale war against Ukraine poses a threat that could extend for years, if not decades, and potentially affect other regions. The constant shelling of border areas, missile attacks, and the dire social, humanitarian, and epidemiological conditions in occupied territories of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions have resulted in profound psychological distress among not only military personnel but also the entire population of Ukraine. This situation has led to a complex and diverse development of post-traumatic stress disorder in the contemporary context. However, despite these tragic events, this topic is of interest due to its scientific, practical, epidemiological significance, among other aspects. There is still no universally accepted theoretical framework defining approaches to the study of the psychological and biological mechanisms underlying post-traumatic stress disorder. Several pathogenetic models of the development of this disorder are currently under development. This disorder is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including asthenia, anxiety, affective, behavioural, and psychotic disorders, which often present challenges in therapy. The most effective approach involves the use of combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions, with antidepressants being the only pharmacological agents endorsed in international clinical guidelines as first-line treatments. While experimental treatment methods exist, they require further investigation. Nonetheless, only about half of the patients achieve remission. Consequently, symptomatic therapy, placebo medications, and polypharmacy have become common in clinical practice, as clinicians attempt to address various comorbid psychopathological symptoms. This approach, to some extent, reflects the lack of well-established effective therapeutic methods and often results in prolonged illness, the development of treatment resistance, and the occurrence of side effects. In general, the efficacy of comprehensive therapy is insufficiently studied and necessitates further representative placebo-controlled and comparative clinical studies, as well as the development of more suitable and effective experimental approaches to investigate novel treatment methods.",

      "title": "Depression: epidemic or pseudo-epidemic?",
      "abstract": "There are a number of under-examined fault lines running through the medical literature on depression, and current clinical practice in the UK. This chiefly stems from a too exclusively biomedical focus, neglecting the social construction of the human mind. For a start, the term `depression' tends to be used without qualification, as if it was settled that we were always referring to a free-standing biologically-based disorder. Yet in everyday usage, as much by doctors as by the general public, `depression' can mean something figurative or literal, can denote a normal or abnormal state, and if abnormal either an individual symptom or a full-blown disorder. And though depression-as-disease may have acquired the status of a natural science category, this was an achievement rather than a discovery: the history of the concept demonstrates the gradual incorporation of a Western cultural vocabulary of guilt, energy, fatigue and stress.1\r\n\r\nOrthodox teaching has been that a `functional shift', the presence of so-called biological features, points to medically significant depression (and responsiveness to anti-depressants). But, bar a small subset of severe cases, there is no reliable demarcation of depression from ordinary unhappiness or misery on this basis. Poor sleep and concentration, weight loss, reduced motivation and drive, anhedonia, etc. (as well as suicidal ideas), not uncommonly accompany ordinary misery as well.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, just before the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners began a Defeat Depression campaign, they surveyed lay people's attitudes to depression and its treatment.2 The views they elicited tended to portray depression in terms of emotional problems, like unhappiness, caused primarily by social and situational factors, and not something to take to general practitioners (GPs). Of the 2003 people polled, 78% saw anti-depressants as addictive, and liable to dull symptoms rather than solve the problem. The Royal Colleges seem to have been undeterred by these findings, which were rather at odds with their view of `depression' as straightforwardly connoting a psychiatric disorder. Indeed the Royal Colleges initiated the Defeat Depression campaign because they believed that 50% of people with depression did not consult their GPs. They wanted to increase this figure. But was the lay view wrong? We can see here how professional pronouncements can contribute to a blurring between unpleasant but commonplace mental states, part of life, and those associated with objective dysfunction and breakdown, meriting medical attention.\r\n\r\nThe other explicitly stated reason for the campaign was the belief that GPs often missed depression anyway. Since then the notion that there were large numbers of undiagnosed cases has been remarkably tenacious. Why? There is, in fact, no sound evidence for an epidemic of depression (as psychiatric disorder) in the UK. On the other hand, the case for an epidemic of antidepressant prescribing is now cast iron. In Britain prescriptions rose from 9 million to 21 million during the 1990s, and in the USA have doubled in only 5 years—mirroring the production and marketing of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants.\r\n\r\nWhat remains striking is how unrobust the evidence base for antidepressants still is, particularly for the mild/moderate cases that account for the majority of all prescriptions.3 Part of the reason is surely that antidepressants will not cure human misery, whether presenting in primary care or in psychiatric clinics. Indeed many of those difficult cases described in psychiatric journals as having `treatment resistant depression' may be `resistant' precisely for this reason.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this repeatedly aired assumption about under-recognition at primary care level has itself led GPs to prescribe more readily. Further, some GPs prescribe for low mood per se, even if other features of the syndrome are absent, and the simpler dose regimens of SSRIs by comparison with tricyclics have helped. Patient feedback is influenced by placebo effects, and by factors like nonspecific sedation that have nothing to do with `antidepression'. People whose record indicates prior prescription of anti-depressants are more likely to be prescribed them again at a later time by other doctors. It remains to be seen if NICE guidelines—which do not recommend antidepressants as the primary intervention in `mild/moderate' cases, make a difference to these trends.4\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical promotion of SSRIs made much of the claim to have fewer side-effects than the tricyclics, and this contributed to the confidence with which GPs recommended them to patients. In view of the public concern about addictive effects evident in the survey described above, it is ironic that discontinuation reactions are now emerging as a distinct clinical problem (extending to litigation against doctors in the USA), both in SSRIs and in other new anti-depressants like venlafaxine.\r\n\r\nThe weak construct validity of psychiatric categories, and the dominance of empiricism over theoretical development, are overarching issues for the psychiatric profession.5 Both are apparent in the discourse about depression. So, too, is a lack of explicit reflection on the ideological and societally-framed nature of medical practice, which would need to take account of cultural shifts in attitudes to adversity and the emergence of an expressive, less stoical individualism.6 The surge in anti-depressant prescribing is as much a cultural trend as a medical one, reflecting the rise of a medicalization and professionalization of everyday life and its problems across Western societies.7\r\n\r\nThere is also an important international dimension. `Depression' is said to contribute 12% of the total burden of nonfatal global disease.8 The World Health Organization describes it as an epidemic that within two decades will be second only to cardiovascular disease in terms of global disease burden. But `depression' has no exact equivalent in non-Western cultures, not least because these do not share a Western ethnopsychology that defines `emotion' as internal, often biological, unintentioned, distinct from cognition, and a feature of individuals rather than situations.9 Non-Western peoples would tend to see the problem in situational and moral terms (as some Western citizens still do, as evidenced by the survey described above), though when they migrate to the West they become more likely to ascribe to a depression-as-disease model.10 This is to highlight the work of culture and its opinion formers—including the medical profession—in shaping a particular interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nThus the use of Western-derived quantitative instruments to estimate population prevalences worldwide is likely to commit a category fallacy, which is the assumption that mental and bodily state phenomena mean the same thing in whatever setting they are detected. There is no such thing as depression, if by this we mean (as the WHO appear to mean) a unitary, universally valid, pathological entity requiring medical intervention. Such claims seem a serious distortion, one serving to deflect attention away from what millions of people might cite as the basis of their misery, like poverty and lack of rights. The one clear-cut beneficiary would be the pharmaceutical industry, with its vested interest in the biologization of the human predicament.",

      "abstract": "Patient Scenario: An adolescent female youth soccer athlete, with a previous concussion history, suffered a second concussion 4 wk ago. Her postconcussive symptoms are affecting her school performance and social and family life. Clinical Outcomes Assessment: Concussion is typically evaluated via symptoms, cognition, and balance. There is no specific patient-oriented outcomes measure for concussion. Clinicians can choose from a variety of generic and specific outcomes instruments aimed at assessing general health-related quality of life or various concussion symptoms and comorbidities such as headache, migraine, fatigue, mood disturbances, depression, anxiety, and concussion-related symptoms. Clinical Decision Making: The data obtained from patient self-report instruments may not actively help clinicians make return-to-play decisions; however, these scales may be useful in providing information that may help the athlete return to school, work, and social activities. The instruments may also serve to identify issues that may lead to problems down the road, including depression or anxiety, or serve to further explore the nature of an athlete’s symptoms. Clinical Bottom Line: Concussion results in numerous symptoms that have the potential to linger and has been associated with depression and anxiety. The use of outcomes scales to assess health-related quality of life and the effect of other symptoms that present with a concussion may allow clinicians to better evaluate the effects of concussion on physical, cognitive, emotional, social, school, and family issues, leading to better and more complete management.",

The signs were associated with other clinical measures of illness behavior and distress, and are not simply a feature of medicolegal presentations. Despite clear caveats about the interpretation of the signs, they have been misinterpreted and misused both clinically and medicolegally. Behavioral responses to examination provide useful clinical information, but need to be interpreted with care and understanding. Isolated signs should not be overinterpreted. Multiple signs suggest that the patient does not have a straightforward physical problem, but that psychological factors also need to be considered. Some patients may require both physical management of their physical pathology and more careful management of the psychosocial and behavioral aspects of their illness. Behavioral signs should be understood as response affected by fear in the context of recovery from injury and the development of chronic incapacity. They offer only a psychological \"yellow-flag\" and not a complete psychological assessment. Behavioral signs are not on their own a test of credibility or faking.",

The perception of dyspnea is highly influenced by emotions. The history and physical examination and the judicious use of laboratory and functional tests will help identify the possible etiologies and underlying mechanisms of dyspnea. Treatment should be focused first on the underlying cause of the dyspnea, and on the symptom itself when disease-modifying interventions are ineffective or have become burdensome. Opioids and other interventions, pharmacological and non-pharmacological, can be effective for the symptomatic treatment of dyspnea.",

      "abstract": "As it is well known, all living humans are subject to daily effects of stress; the stress response varies among individuals depending on the experience that has endowed each person to learn how to deal with stress. Stress relief may be obtained by procedures that lead the subject to “forget” the bad situation or to relax, for instance physical exercise, talking the problem to someone else, drinking alcoholic beverages or using drugs of abuse. Drug addiction develops in persons voluntarily seeking relief from a depressive situation, usually linked to personal catastrophic event, death of a dear family member or a valuable loss of personal belonging, or else also voluntarily aiming to a novel mood enhancing experience, in spite of being conscious of the unwanted effects – dependence – arising from repetitive drug taking, the most serious being addiction, a persistent state in which compulsive drug use escapes control. Addictive drugs besides providing a pleasant rewarding experience also generate reinforcing behaviors of the drug effects leading to tolerance, dependency compulsion, persistence, chronicity with multiple relapses and withdrawal syndrome. The compulsion and persistence are based on pathological molecular mechanisms similar to those involved in memory. Studies done both in humans and rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavior abnormalities associated with addiction are related to changes in the brain, both at molecular and cellular levels. The plastic changes in the dopaminergic VTA NAc pathway and the interconnected structures, also include changes in the gene transcription, RNA and protein processing and in synaptic structure. All the specific changes so far identified are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the behaviors associated with addiction.",

      "abstract": "Agitation is a frequent clinical condition that notably raises the hospital morbidity. It generally coexists with a wide range of mental and cognitive symptoms and has a diverse clinical course. Agitation is a state of extreme restlessness or irritability including excessive muscular activity accompanied by a sense of inner strain and exceeding restlessness associated with mental discomfort. It occurs frequently in psychiatric units, emergency rooms, and nursing care homes, and is a common condition experienced by the patients especially of neuropsychiatric diseases. Agitation is the third most prevalent neuropsychiatric symptom in dementia, behind apathy and depression, with an overall approximate prevalence of 30%. Agitation has variable prevalence as per the diseases. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the etiology, epidemiology and common disorders associated with agitation. Trauma particularly to the head, widespread infection, sepsis, dementia, delirium, exposure to toxins, electrolyte imbalances, endocrine abnormalities, and a post-ictal state is one of the risk factors for agitation. Agitation prevalence varies between 30% and 50% in Alzheimer's disease, accounts for 30% in dementia with Lewy bodies, 40% in frontotemporal dementia, and 40% in vascular dementia, as per the various studies. Agitation is a broad category of unrelated behaviours that frequently changes course and is visible in a range of clinical settings. Several underlying pathophysiologic conditions are mediated by dysregulations of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and GABAergic systems. Further research will be helpful in defining new management strategies.",

Major depressive disorder is a common complication, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Depressive disorders can cause patients to develop certain diseases that occur postoperatively, especially in patients who have malignant tumors or carcinomas that will undergo surgery. Depression is associated with cognitive impairment, which is exacerbated by postoperative events. There is evidence that postoperative pain is seriously depressing and depression causes pain to worsen. Depression is also said to be a strong predictor and correlates with persistent postoperative pain. Some studies say depression is an objective risk factor that can lead to a long recovery after surgery. Depression can also occur in patients admitted to the intensive care unit, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, thereby increasing the possibility of additional hospitalization costs.",

Furthermore, chronic pain is strongly associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and in particular, anxiety, depression and insomnia. Accordingly, pain is associated with decrements of many aspects of patient's lives including physical and emotional functioning, affective symptoms and sleep problems. The negative impact is higher in patients with greater pain severity. However, there is a bidirectional relationship between chronic pain and these symptoms. Patients with somatisation, health-seeking behaviours and poor sleep are at high risk of developing chronic widespread pain. The risk increases in tandem with severity of anxiety, depression or sleep problems, and those with multiple predisposing factors are at the highest risk (Figure 1)\nTherefore, clinically, it may be prudent to consider pain, sleep problems and anxiety/depression as co-existent components of a triad, where the presence of symptoms of one component should prompt investigation for the others.",

Many factors influence patients psychosocial functioning; they can be grouped into illness related factors, context related factors and factors related to individual resources. Among illness related factors, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment are the most largely investigated domains. Evidence has been provided that negative symptoms are related to a poor psychosocial outcome; however, whether negative symptoms contribute to patients disability or represent its consequence is an open issue. Moreover, the study of relationships between negative symptoms and psychosocial functioning is further complicated by the overlap between the two domains in several assessment instruments and by the definition of negative symptoms as a unitary construct. Cognitive impairment has also been reported in association with poor psychosocial functioning. It is debated whether a global impairment in cognition is relevant to poor functioning in the real life, or deficit of specific cognitive domains (including social cognition) play the most important role, or whether specific cognitive deficits are actually responsible for the impairment of specific aspect of psychosocial functioning. The need for future treatments to target negative symptoms and cognitive impairment for their direct and indirect impact on psychosocial functioning will be highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

Female athletes may be at more risk of concussion compared with male athletes; however, more research is needed. Evaluation of concussion involves assessments of multiple domains or clinical profiles, including vestibular, ocular, headache, cognitive, mood, fatigue, and other systems. Initial management consists of a short rest period followed by increasing activity that does not exacerbate symptoms. Cognitive modifications for school or work also are initiated early in the management plan. Use of other management modalities is based on findings from the physical examination. Imaging may be needed in cases of worsening or progressive symptoms. When athletes have returned to baseline symptom burden and have returned to school or work, they may transition to a return to play/sport progression. Most sports-related concussions resolve within 2 weeks for adults and 4 weeks for adolescents. Risk factors for prolonged recovery include initial high symptom burden, multiple concussions, young age, mental health issues, and migraine history.",

      "title": "Psychosocial problems observed in older adults after disaster",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural disasters are large‐scale catastrophic events that seriously disrupt the functioning of a community or society. The frequency and severity of disasters are increasing and involve widespread human, material, economic, or environmental impacts that exceed the ability of the society affected by them to cope using its resources. In addition, disasters significantly affect the physical, emotional, and psychological health of individuals and cause numerous deaths, injuries, and economic losses. One of the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of disasters is the elderly. The increase in the elderly population worldwide brings with it the problems specific to this period and the service needs for these problems. The population consists of older adults, who are among the most vulnerable groups to the negative effects of natural disasters. During the social traumatisation process triggered by natural disasters, elderly people experience intense feelings of anxiety, fear, anger, helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, futurelessness, and insecurity. Reactions such as unresponsiveness, alienation, inability to focus, and inability to remember are normal during this process. The normality of these feelings and responses in the acute period, which can last up to 3 months, will give way to abnormality unless the necessary physical and psychosocial conditions are provided. When the necessary psychosocial conditions are not provided, elderly individuals who experience a disaster may experience mental problems such as post‐traumatic stress disorder, depression, somatisation disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. In this context, providing the necessary psychosocial support for older adults to cope with psychosocial problems after a disaster and facilitating access to this support is very important in terms of adapting to the post‐disaster period.",

      "abstract": "Sensitization is conceptually related to cognitive bias in experimental psychopathology, and they share the basic mechanism of neuronal sensitization. Every strongly relevant individual concern, like fears, can yield cognitive bias or \"cognitive-emotional sensitization\". It might also be present for bodily and environmental information related to illness, and could be an etiological factor in medically unexplained complaints. Physiological and cognitive sensitization are theoretically compared. There is evidence for cognitive-emotional sensitization in some medically unexplained somatic complaints, and negative affect is suggested as a catalyst. Prolonged cognitive-emotional sensitization (\"perseverative negative cognition\" or worry, rumination) might even have demonstrable somatic pathological effects. It is concluded that sensitization may be organized at different levels, both in the organism and in the larger living system within which the organism is subsumed. This view might not only help to clarify medically unexplained pain syndromes, but virtually every subjective complaint, both with and without recognized physiopathology.",

These symptoms can lead the person to lose his or her job and lower the quality of life of both patients and their relatives.To review the literature on demographic, clinical, cognitive, psychiatric, occupational and social variables associated with the work situation.Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have detected variables related with unemployment. Empirical research has shown how physical disability, fatigue and the progression of the disease exert a clear influence on the patient's work situation. Yet, the same degree of evidence is not true for gender, depression, age, duration of the disease and cognitive variables. Little attention has been given to work characteristics such as job discrimination, employer's attitude, labour laws, colleagues' attitudes and transport problems.Many of the factors that determine job loss in a patient with multiple sclerosis can be identified in time to allow them to be modified or offset. The knowledge provided by the studies mentioned above makes it possible to detect patients who are at risk of losing their job so that interventions can be carried out with the aim of preventing such a situation from occurring. More particularly, the vulnerability profile includes high physical disability and fatigue, progressive development of the disease and the presence of cognitive impairment, among others.Factores asociados con la situacion laboral de pacientes con esclerosis multiple.Introduccion. La esclerosis multiple es una enfermedad neurologica desmielinizante que suele provocar trastornos motrices, perceptivos, afectivos y cognitivos a quienes la padecen. Estos sintomas pueden llevar a la persona a perder su empleo, y disminuir la calidad de vida del paciente y sus familiares. Objetivo. Revisar estudios sobre variables demograficas, clinicas, cognitivas, psiquiatricas, laborales y sociales asociadas con la situacion laboral. Desarrollo. Estudios transversales y longitudinales han detectado variables relacionadas con el desempleo. Las investigaciones empiricas muestran una influencia clara de la discapacidad fisica, la fatiga y el curso de la enfermedad sobre la situacion laboral. Sin embargo, el genero, la depresion, la edad, la duracion de la enfermedad y las variables cognitivas no poseen el mismo grado de evidencia. Caracteristicas de la ocupacion, como discriminacion laboral, actitud del empleador, leyes laborales, actitud de los compañeros de trabajo y dificultades en el transporte han sido variables poco consideradas. Conclusiones. Muchos de los factores que determinan la perdida de empleo en un paciente con esclerosis multiple pueden identificarse a tiempo para poder modificarlos o compensarlos. Los conocimientos aportados por los estudios reseñados permiten detectar a aquellos pacientes que se encuentran en riesgo de perder su empleo para realizar intervenciones posibles con el objetivo de prevenir esta situacion. En particular, el perfil de vulnerabilidad incluye alta discapacidad fisica y fatiga, curso progresivo de la enfermedad y presencia de deterioro cognitivo, entre otros.",

Esto se debe a que comparten patrones del TOC y porque las personas con alteraciones provocadas por excoriacion y tricotilomania presentan mayor incidencia de TOC y cuadros asociados.A pesar que algunos sujetos pueden lastimarse por habito o aburrimiento, en muchas ocasiones se pellizcan la piel o arrancan el pelo para afrontar pensamientos o emociones negativas como ansiedad, tension, tristeza o enojo. Mientras lo hacen pueden sentir alivio, pero este es frecuentemente seguido por sentimientos de verguenza o culpa.La forma adecuada de ayudar a estos pacientes es que los profesionalesque los tratan conozcan este nuevo encuadre diagnostico y sus tratamientos.

Largely classified as an impulse control disorder, they are now considered as part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder because they share features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Also, because people with skin picking disorder and trichotillomania are more likely to have OCD and other OC spectrum disorders than people without them.Even though some people may pick out of habit or boredom, they often pick their skin or pull their hair in order to cope with negative thoughts or emotions, such as anxiety, stress, tension, sadness or anger. While picking, people may feel relief, but then they often feel ashamed or guilty.The right way to help these patients is that those professionals that treat them know the new diagnosis framework and their specific treatment. Therefore, we conducted a revision of the cutaneous manifestations associated to these disorders, their etiopathogenic mechanisms and their possible therapeutic approaches.Key words: self-inflicted dermatoses, skin picking disorder, dermatillomania, trichotillomania, obsessive-compulsive disorder.Dermatol.

      "title": "The Interplay between Pain, Anxiety and Depression",
      "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience with two inseparable components: sensory and emotional. The personal property of pain experience makes it difficult to manage and treat due to the influence of genetics, age, gender, spiritual beliefs, social-economic status, and cultural factors. Similarly, medical care methods partly control pain experience and regulate pain progression. Contrary to chronic pain, which is continuous and recurrent, acute pain is primarily due to trauma, acute medical conditions, or treatment. Whatever the case, both can cause mood disorders. The interplay between mood disorders and pain upholds a progressively significant bidirectional link, as mood disorders and pain are risk factors for each other. Depression and anxiety heighten pain perception or decrease pain tolerance. Acute or chronic pain can also increase the chances of mood dysregulation. Although depression and anxiety have a close relationship with acute pain, the interplay between depression and acute pain is more comprehensively studied. Most depressed patients present pain as their sole complaint in primary care practices, which unfortunately is overlooked by physicians. Howbeit, reports on experimentally induced pain perception in depressed patients are mixed, presenting both an amplified and reduced pain threshold and tolerance. Although there are less published data about pain and anxiety, the association is regular because increased anxiety equally increases pain perception while decreasing tolerance. The aim of this review was to elucidate more on the mechanisms delineating the interconnectivity of pain and mood disorders.",

Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "abstract": "1494 Leg pain which occurs only with exercise and disappears on cessation of exercise is a common presenting complaint. The primary source of this pain could be bone, muscle compartment, vascular or neural tissue. These different sources can usually be differentiated on the basis of history and physical examination. Bone stress occurs as a continuum from normal bone at one end of the continuum to the development of a stress fracture at the other end. The main characteristic of bone injury is the presence of focal tenderness over the bone. The two main sites of compartment syndrome are the anterior compartment and the deep posterior compartment. Patients with compartment syndrome complain of a characteristic feeling of tightness in the relevant area. This pain is alleviated as soon as exercise ceases. Vascular and neural causes of exercise-induced leg pain are relatively uncommon but should be considered in cases with atypical presentations. Vascular entrapments present with claudication-type pain and a vascular bruit can often be heard over the site of the narrowing if the patient is examined immediately following exercise. Neural entrapments may present as exercise-induced pain rather than the classic presentation with neurological symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The three types of pain related to exercise are 1) pain experienced during or immediately following exercise, 2) delayed onset muscle soreness, and 3) pain induced by muscle cramps. Each is characterized by a different time course and different etiology. Pain perceived during exercise is considered to result from a combination of factors including acids, ions, proteins, and hormones. Although it is commonly believed that lactic acid is responsible for this pain, evidence suggests that it is not the only factor. However, no single factor has ever been identified. Delayed onset muscle soreness develops 24-48 hours after strenuous exercise biased toward eccentric (muscle lengthening) muscle actions or strenuous endurance events like a marathon. Soreness is accompanied by a prolonged strength loss, a reduced range of motion, and elevated levels of creatine kinase in the blood. These are taken as indirect indicators of muscle damage, and biopsy analysis has documented damage to the contractile elements. The exact cause of the soreness response is not known but thought to involve an inflammatory reaction to the damage. Muscle cramps are sudden, intense, electrically active contractions elicited by motor neuron hyperexcitability. Although it is commonly assumed that cramps during exercise are the result of fluid electrolyte imbalance induced by sweating, two studies have not supported this. Moreover, participants in occupations that require chronic use of a muscle but do not elicit profuse sweating, such as musicians, often experience cramps. Fluid electrolyte imbalance may cause cramps if there is profuse prolonged sweating such as that found in working in a hot environment. Thus, despite the common occurrence of pain associated with exercise, the exact cause of these pains remains a mystery.",

The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person's lifetime. Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient's physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation. Pronounced joint hypermobility which led the patient to flex her joints excessively, causing subluxations in several districts, was the only sign overlooked. Exploring the patient's articular features in her clinical context led us to diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome, a complex and often ignored condition. The case highlights the utility of a multidisciplinary approach and coordinated interventions to define and manage this clinical entity.",

      "abstract": "Auras of somatic and visceral sensibility are commonly experienced as part of the epileptic sequence of events, and their divers varieties have been fully described in a prolific literature on the subject. The \"sensory march\" of the jacksonian fit and the variegated epigastric aura represent the sensory component of what may or may not terminate in the motor expression of the epileptic attack. These sensory manifestations may include the element of pain, but usually they are not confined to a single somatic segment or focal visceral area. Localized pain, as an isolated phenomenon not associated with somatic convulsive seizures or with other motor, sensory or psychic variants of epilepsy would rarely be considered a form of epilepsy even though its occurrence was episodic and paroxysmal. However, it was conjectured prophetically without benefit of electroencephalography by Wilson<sup>1</sup>in 1928. The frequency with which unexplained abdominal pain occurs both in children",

      "abstract": "Addicts and alcoholics suffer vulnerabilities and deficits in self-regulation. A principal manifestation of their self-regulation disturbances is evident in the way they attempt to self-medicate painful affect states and related psychiatric problems. Individuals select a particular drug based on its ability to relieve or augment emotions unique to an individual which they cannot achieve or maintain on their own. Addicts and alcoholics usually experiment with all classes of drugs, but discover that a particular drug suits them best. Usually, painful affect states interact with other problems in self-regulation involving self-esteem, relationships, self-care, and related characterological defenses, making it more likely that addicts will experiment with and find the action of a particular drug appealing or compelling. Stimulants have their appeal because their energizing properties relieve distress associated with depression, hypomania, and hyperactivity; opiates are compelling because they mute and contain disorganizing affects of rage and aggression; and sedative hypnotics, including alcohol, permit the experience of affection, aggression, and closeness in individuals who are otherwise cut off from their feelings and relationships.",

      "abstract": "Any physical or psychological stimuli that disrupt homeostasis result in a stress response. The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.

[9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]. Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death. adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well. The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral). General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer.. Psychosocial Treatment Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo alto, Ca1991Google Scholar, 18.Kissane D.W. Love A.

Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

      "abstract": "Pendidikan kedokteran merupakan jurusan akademik yang sangat diminati dan ditargetkan oleh banyak kalangan. Namun, dalam proses pembelajarannya, seorang mahasiswa kedokteran harus menghadapi berbagai tuntutan akademik yang berat dan dapat menyebabkan kesehatan mentalnya terganggu. Gangguan kesehatan mental merupakan kondisi seseorang mengalami gangguan psikologis sehingga menyebabkan perubahan negatif pada kesejahteraan hidup, fisiologis kejiwaan, dan kecakapan hidup. Beberapa contoh gangguan ini adalah perasaan stres, cemas, dan depresi. Stres merupakan reaksi tertekan pada tubuh terhadap besarnya tuntutan dan kewajiban yang harus dilakukan dalam waktu tertentu. Cemas adalah kondisi seseorang yang merasa gelisah, takut, dan khawatir yang terlalu berlebihan terhadap masa depan. Depresi merupakan kondisi berkurangnya energi tubuh, berkurangnya minat dalam menjalankan aktivitas sehari-hari, serta perasaan sedih yang berkepanjangan. Segala stresor yang menyebabkan gangguan kesehatan mental ini tidak hanya didapatkan dari proses pembelajaran, namun juga didapatkan dari kondisi eksternal, seperti tekanan dari teman sejawat, finansial, dan keluarga. Gangguan kesehatan mental mampu memberikan pengaruh besar bagi mahasiswa kedokteran dalam melaksanakan aktivitas perkuliahannya, salah satunya adalah pengaruhnya terhadap hasil Uji Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter (UKMPPD). UKMPPD merupakan exit exam nasional bagi mahasiswa program profesi dokter yang harus diambil sebelum mengangkat sumpah dokter, ujian ini terdiri atas Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) dan Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Kondisi mental yang tidak sehat berpengaruh pada kinerja mahasiswa dalam menganalisis setiap materi yang akan dipelajari. Besarnya beban mental yang ditampung mahasiswa akan membuat diri mereka tidak fokus untuk mempelajari materi secara terstruktur sehingga tidak semua materi dapat dipelajari dengan baik. Hal ini bermuara pada hasil UKMPPD yang tidak optimal.",

Chronic pain has been considered a natural and unfortunate side effect which accompanied a primary illness or accident. Work injuries and motor vehicle accidents account for over 80% of the beginning nightmares for the chronic pain patient. Chronic pain has multiple causes, each of which raises the stress dimension and impacts a patient's life. However, the nonanatomic distribution of the pain and associated tenderness is one of the factors that may identify it as chronic pain. Chronic pain is accompanied by stress and distress which lead to chronic disease. In 1936 Dr. Selye discovered the general adaption syndrome in which all stress producers, such as physical, chemical, and psychological damaging agents, will provoke a reproducible nonspecific body response.",

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Symptoms are the body's major signaling device, but symptoms often are frustratingly vague, subjective, and ill reported. In addition, challenges attend making decisions about an individual's ability to function based solely on the medical diagnosis, particularly when impairment is subtle or subjective. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a model for understanding the limits of the medical approach to determining impairment and disability. A protocol from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is used to define CFS. This protocol is not a list of diagnostic criteria, and some patients with chronic fatigue may not meet the CDC definition. The syndrome reflects dysfunction in the neuroendocrine system similar in some ways to that seen with depressive illness, and most patients seen for this condition fulfill the criteria for depression, which is another illness characterized by fatigue and somatic complaints. Physicians who evaluate and treat patients with subtle persistent illness know that employers and coworkers respond less positively to an employee's needs when illness is subtle than when impairment is obvious. Physicians must be clear about the family, job, and employment risks patients take when they stay out of work for medical reasons; they also must recognize the risk these patients take when they continue to work despite impaired performance.",

The symptoms of stress are many: irritability and frustration; altered sleep patterns despite increasing fatigue; laughter is less frequent; concentration is reduced; increased sensitivity to noise; and inability to make decisions. There are also physiological symptoms such as high blood pressure, increased heart rate, sweating, numbness, lack of bladder and bowel control, indigestion and tension headaches.

      "title": "An Undervalued Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Perinatal Period: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that occurs around childbirth, typically after a traumatic birth experience, where women may feel violated due to traumatic childbirth interventions they cannot control. Traumatic birth is defined as an event in which the mother perceives a real or perceived threat to herself or her baby, causing intense fear, helplessness, and horror. This can be considered an obstetric sequel. It is relevant to note that among pregnant women, perinatal PTSD is the third most common psychiatric disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 0.8% to 43% worldwide. Despite its significance, it is little-known, underdiagnosed, and often confused with other conditions such as depression or anxiety. Furthermore, it results in serious family, social, and occupational dysfunctions and is associated with other pathologies. Clinically, women with perinatal PTSD experience symptoms such as re-experiencing the event, detachment from the newborn, nightmares, irritability, and rejection of motherhood. This can lead to consequences for the mother, ranging from a desire not to become pregnant again to severe symptoms such as dissociation, stress, anxiety, and depression. It also affects those close to the mother, such as the partner and family. The aim of this work is to describe perinatal PTSD and emphasize the importance of early identification and appropriate treatment by medical professionals for the benefit of mothers and their children THE CASE: We describe a 35-year-old patient with a history of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder since 2018 experiences perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder. This is related to physical and verbal abuse during her second childbirth, resulting in a traumatic experience. Her childhood was marked by the feeling that her mother favored her younger sister and subjected her to physical and emotional abuse. The first pregnancy was unplanned, and she faced humiliation and abandonment by her partner. Despite the circumstances, the birth was a positive experience. The second pregnancy was planned and desired, but during childbirth in a different clinic from the first, she experienced inadequate care conditions, a lack of privacy, and physical abuse by medical staff. She also received inappropriate comments from the attending gynecologist. During the postpartum period, she shared a room with a cancer patient, complicating her experience. After childbirth, she experienced a hypertensive disorder in the postpartum and chose not to return to the hospital where she gave birth due to her traumatic experiences. Overall, her story reveals a series of challenging experiences related to motherhood that have contributed to her current mental health state. CONCLUSION: Perinatal PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that affects a significant number of pregnant and postpartum women. Its prevalence varies widely, reflecting the need for increased awareness and early detection. Despite its considerable impact on maternal mental health and well-being, perinatal PTSD is often overlooked or confused with other conditions such as depression and anxiety. It's important to raise awareness among medical staff about this disorder and provide a comprehensive and empathetic approach to enhance care for mothers during childbirth and the postpartum period.",

      "title": "Reactive Psychoses Revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

These may include organic aggressive, or organic affective syndromes that are episodic in nature and therefore require a more specific diagnosis, a different classification, and a different approach to treatment. Consequently, it is necessary for clinicians to learn to distinguish between \"primary\" psychiatric illnesses and those disorders of behavioural control and mood that stem specifically from brain injury. There is relatively little in the clinical literature that explains the relationship between variable states of behaviour, mood or temperament, and clinical disorders that may have long-term implications for patient management. This concept paper therefore addresses abnormalities of mood and behaviour that are episodic in character and are not recognisably included in the DSM and ICD classifications of psychological or psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We summarize popular and pre-scientific conceptions of the relationship between crying, well-being and health, and we review the scientific literature on this topic. First, the focus is on whether crying brings relief and facilitates emotional recovery. Next, we discuss the evidence addressing whether crying or its chronic inhibition is associated with an increased risk of developing health problems. Finally, we address crying as a signal or symptom of disease. It is concluded that the question regarding whether crying brings relief has yielded seemingly contrasting findings, dependent on the design of the study. Concerning the second and third issues, there is a lack of sound studies. Little is known about the nature of the association between depression and crying. The evidence for a relationship between neurological disorders (in particular, stroke and multiple sclerosis) appears more convincing. There is also mainly anecdotal evidence of increased crying in a wide variety of health problems, which may reflect symptoms of disease, co-morbid depression, adjustment problems, or side effects of treatment. Some recent studies further suggest a positive effect of crying on health status in certain patient groups. More systematic and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the relationship between crying and health.",

      "abstract": "Delusional mis-identification syndromes constitute a number of disorders that involve a myriad of delusions related to the identity of self or other. The forms of delusion range from mis-attribution of identity related to self, other, as well as parts of the body. Although rare, these syndromes are encountered in a number of different forms by medical and psychiatric personnel, as well as other types of mental health workers. This is especially true since many of the syndromes have organic etiology and are treated via medical rather than psychological intervention. Nevertheless, delusional mis-identification syndromes often co-exist with psychiatric issues which can be helped by concurrent psychological treatment. Given that identity is central to human beings and their cultures, it is not surprising that delusional mis-identification is represented in a number of cultural beliefs. Some cultural expressions of delusional mis-identification may function as coping mechanisms for anxiety over loss of identity or the trauma of infant mortality.",

Within the social approach, there are three dominant theories of mental illness etiology: stress theory, structural strain theory and labeling theory. This chapter describes each theory's basic concepts and assumptions, theoretical limitations and advantages, and implications for treating or preventing mental illness. According to stress theory, when events and strains accumulate in people's lives, they can overwhelm people's psychosocial resources and abilities to cope and then generate symptoms of psychological disorder. Labeling theory picks up at this point and suggests that frequent, severe, or highly visible symptoms or symptoms exhibited by those with little social prestige or power, can launch a victimizing process. Societal reactions to symptoms may result in the person's receiving a formal psychiatric diagnosis, becoming hospitalized, and, ultimately, accepting a mental patient identity.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is an impossible concept. Under this heading, a number of psychoses is being grouped which have the common characteristic that the patient is, as a rule, but by no means always, fully conscious. In all other respects, no other points agree, neither in respect of symptoms, nor in respect of etiology or prognosis. Hence, there are hardly any reasons to reduce these disease patterns to a common denominator, either as \"schizophrenia\" or as a \"group of schizophrenic psychoses\". Rather, it seems more probable that schizophrenic psychoses are individual disease patterns, instead of being variations of a basic type. What is principally needed at this stage, is a fair amount of empirical research to catalog the concept of schizophrenia. Such a catalog would have to be based on exactly defined and described syndromes to enable further study whether there are any other points besides these symptoms which characterize the syndrome in question, such as etiology, pathogenetic factors, course, or response treatment. The more characteristics are found, the greater the chance that the disease pattern under investigation is really a unit by itself. In the course of these studies, and in order to avoid terminological confusion, it is advisable to use, for the time being, the term \"schizophrenic psychoses\", under the condition that in each concrete case this term must be supplemented by a careful typification of the symptomatology, of the etiologic factors, and of the course of the disease.",

Postpartum depression is associated with anxiety, mood swings, tiredness, feeling scared all the time, trouble sleeping or sleeping, weight loss, stress eating, losing interest, sudden weight gain, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions, fatigue and several other issues. It can happen during pregnancy as well as after giving birth. Some women experience baby blues while some experience postpartum depression. Women feel depressed and sadly most of the time. Depression can make it difficult for mother to take care of herself and the child. Various lifestyle choices also need to be mentioned while talking about factors causing PPD. Some factors affecting PPD are lack of physical activity and exercise, bad eating habits, disturbed sleep cycle etc. it may include hormonal changes, sleep deprivation, risk factors, psychological stress. One of the chief factors affecting postpartum depression is the sleep cycle. It is seen that less sleep is brought near to postnatal depression. Exercise, psychosocial support, physical stretching or working activity can decrease symptoms of depression. Exercise causes the release of mood-boosting hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which elevates the mood. Low esteem caused by depression can be decreased by an elevated mood. Exercise can also increase endogenous endorphins and opioids which gives a positive mood. It also increases problem solving capacity and confidence. The most common management methods used for managing depression are psychological support, professional help, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive therapy.",

Emotional disturbances may mask these subtle problems, but they can also result from them. Clinical experience indicates that these problems are more apt to become stressful when the patient misinterprets or copes ineffectively with them. That these common problems of brain injured adults may be overlooked in the usual clinical examination was shown in a comparison of clinical records of 50 patients referred for neuropsychological consultation with records of 46 patient-participants in a longitudinal neuropsychological study. Significantly more reports of these problems appeared in the latter group of records. However, consultation records did reflect emotional distress. Irritability, depression, or anxiety affected all but six consultation patients and appeared with equal frequency among working patients as among those unable to work or needing full-time care. This suggests that some of their emotional distress resulted from less obvious problems than those impairing mobility, strength, or competency. Counseling can reduce the patient's vulnerability to the psychologically crippling effects of perplexity, distractibility, and fatigue. Specific recommendations for patient and family counseling are offered.",

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

      "title": "Hoarding Disorder in DSM-5: Clinical description and cognitive approach",
      "abstract": "Hoarding disorder is characterized by difficulty discarding or parting with possessions regardless their actual value as well as, in most cases, persistent acquisition of objects. Possessions are accumulated in large numbers that fill up and clutter active living space to the extent that its intended use is no longer possible resulting to significant functional impairment and/or distress. Saving and difficulty discarding appear to be associated to subjective beliefs about the instrumental, sentimental or intrinsic value of objects. Despite significant impact on the individual, the family and the community, until recently hoarding disorder had been a \"neglected\" clinical phenomenon. The recent research efforts to study and understand this phenomenon led to significant changes regarding the diagnostic status and therapeutic interventions. It was classified as a distinct diagnostic entity in the recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association-5th ed. (DSM-5). Hoarding is not considered a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder or obsessive compulsive personality disorder anymore and it is now ranked among compulsive spectrum disorders. So far the cognitive model for hoarding disorder is the main, widely accepted, clinically and empirically supported theoretical framework for understanding its features. The cognitive model offers an explanation about the predisposing, onset and perpetuating factors of the disorder as well as the basis for the development of specific therapeutic interventions. The cognitive model conceptualizes hoarding disorder as a result of four factors: personal vulnerability (heredity, early experiences and life events, personality traits, interpersonal difficulties), difficulties in information processing (deficits in attention, memory, executive functions such as decision making and categorization), maladaptive cognitive content (meaning of possessions, emotional attachment to possessions, dysfunctional beliefs in relation to the mnemonic ability and memory importance) through which hoarding behaviors are reinforced and finally installed (positive and negative reinforcement, association with positive or negative emotions e.g. pleasure in relation to acquisition/saving and anxiety or discomfort in relation to discarding). The purpose of this article is to inform about this new disorder giving emphasis on recent data in regard to its phenomenology and provide a detailed description of the cognitive model. Finally, a brief mention on the psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions is presented. Hoarding Disorder is a difficult clinical problem to treat. Poor insight, ego-syntonic nature of symptoms and treatment resistance are often reported in patients. Further improvement of the therapeutic interventions in order to improve effectiveness and target the high rate of treatment drop out is needed.",

      "abstract": "While there is no exact definition of sleep acceptable by all authorities, it is generally accepted that ordinary sleep is characterised by a loss of critical reactivity to events in the environment, an increased threshold of general sensibility and reflex irritability, and the ability of being aroused or brought back to a state of wakefulness (Kleitman, 1929). There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

Pain most often appears because of the already existing pathological substrate. Increased efforts caused by the specific military service emphasized the painful disturbances that could be eliminated by short-term drug therapy. Early diagnosis had the irreplaceable role in professional orientation. Diagnosis such as lumbosacral syndrome should be avoided. The exact cause should be determined thus making a more precise diagnosis and therefore the therapy more successful. Physical treatment combined with the other treatments is of particular significance.",

      "title": "[Current psychological findings in essential hypertension].",
      "abstract": "Many authors have investigated the role of psychic factors in the pathogenesis of idiopathic hypertension. Experimental studies have confirmed that the emotional stress induces a longterm blood pressure increase. Psychophysiologic investigations have revealed that patients with essential hypertension, when compared to the healthy population, are characterized by prompt reactions at the very initial stage of the disease, accompanied by an elevation of the biochemical and vegetative functional parameters, blood pressure in particular. It is in concordance with findings that hypertonics have hemodynamic reactions at rest quite similar to those found in normotonics under the emotional stress. Certain psychosocial factors cannot be identified as absolute causes of the disease. Their particular role varies from person to person. It depends on particular personality features whether any of these factors will be experienced as a stress. It has therefore been assumed that hypertension is a concomitant vegetative phenomenon, typical for people who have a permanent feeling of anger or for ambitious people who are under a permanent pressure of striving for success. Numerous psychological investigations have led to a conclusion that hypertonics have psychological troubles which cannot generally be considered as specific for hypertension. The question concerning the part played by such behaviour as the primary cause of the disease is still to be answered. Doubtlessly, such behaviour is frequent in hypertonics and it probably contributes to persistence of the disease, since they are more apt to stressogenic situations. These findings have resulted in formulating the therapeutic strategies with psychophysiologic orientation. At the physiological level, they resolve the increased excitement and lower the excessive reactivity of the vegetative nervous system, whereas on the psychological level, applying psychotherapy methods, they achieve both cognitive and behavioural changes.",

Muitas patologias hoje estudadas têm a íntima relação com o estresse, e estabelecer a relação estresse/doença é fundamental para o estudo de alunos e profissionais da odontologia. O estresse se caracteriza como uma resposta do organismo a agressões de ordem física, psíquica e infecciosa capazes de perturbar seu equilíbrio. O excesso do estresse, seja por grande intensidade ou duração do agente agressor, é capaz de produzir alterações a qualquer nível neuroendocrinoimune do organismo estabelecendo, assim, a relação estresse/doença, o que explica a participação de fatores psíquicos no desenvolvimento de determinadas condições na mucosa bucal. Estar relacionado a condições como doença periodontal, líquen plano, língua geográfica, herpes simples e ulceração aftosa, o estresse emocional também pode resultar em disfunções temporomandibulares. É necessário enfatizar que estas condições devem merecer atenção especial do cirurgião-dentista, que, por sua vez, faz parte de uma equipe multidisciplinar no atendimento do paciente, sendo necessário o encaminhamento do paciente portador de uma dessas condições associadas ao estresse a profissionais especializados, para uma terapia adjunta, exercícios, podendo melhorar sobremaneira o resultado do tratamento odontológico.",

      "abstract": "Chronic abdominopelvic pain is a debilitating problem that presents challenges to patients and clinicians alike. Symptoms of abdominopelvic pain are among the most commo symptoms presenting to primary care and fall within the scope of a large number of medical specialities, especially gynaecology, gastroenterology, and urology. Such pain can be a warning sign of serious pathology, but chronic abdominopelvic pain must be recognized as a disease in its own right, since it can exist as a chronic condition without identifiable pathology. Traditionally, the management of pelvic pain has focused on biomedical mechanisms such as infective, inflammatory, or malignant conditions; it is now understood, however, that many of the mechanisms are attributable to modulation of pain processing within the nervous system. Although a peripheral stimulus such as inflammation may initiate pelvic pain, the condition or syndrome may become persistent as a result of these mechanisms. Chronic pain syndromes are associated with a variety of cognitive, behavioural, social, sexual, and functional phenomena. These form the basis for diagnosis and must be addressed through multidisciplinary care. Functional disorders, for the purpose of this article, are disorders characterized by disturbance of function (such as urinary urge/frequency in bladder pain syndrome). The term is not used in the sense of a psychiatric functional disorder. Associated psychological disturbances should be considered a result of the disease rather than a cause and there must be an associated conceptual shift, in healthcare providers who work with these patients, to acknowledge this. The authors acknowledge that ongoing organ pathology, such as endometriosis, can produce persistent pain, but the management of specific diseases is beyond the scope of this article. This article will focus on pain syndromes in which no identifiable cause can be found.",

Brain imaging and neurophysiology studies have helped demonstrate multiple areas and aspects of brain dysfunction, implicating a disruption of physiological \"networks.\" Disorders of energy metabolism, immune regulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and the autonomic nervous system are also theorized to participate in the pathogenesis. Other markers of fatigue include findings on polysomnography and tests of vigilance and attention. Nonpharmacologic treatments include energy conservation, cooling, exercise, rehabilitation therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, electromagnetic maneuvers, and mindfulness techniques. Medication trials have met with mixed results. Ideally future studies will better help link elements of fatigue to study findings and enable improved therapeutic modalities.",

      "abstract": "The origin and pathophysiological background of MS-associated fatigue is poorly understood. There is no unifying concept of its nature and its determinants to date. This paper reviews possible influences of factors determining personality profile on mental fatigue in MS. Likewise, the role of psychological factors and their interaction with personality to promote fatigue is discussed. Current data suggests that fatigue, especially in early MS states, may be influenced by vulnerable personality traits and personality-associated features. Among them are depressive disease coping, avoidance behavior and inhibition, irritability, less extraversion, neuroticism, disturbed reward responsiveness and somatization behavior. However, among the validated personality factors no genuine influences that are independent of depression have been documented. From a psychological perspective, depressiveness, anxiety and perhaps somatization may be relevant mediators of fatigue. Interesting to note that in early MS a psychiatric diagnosis is significantly more likely than on a later stage of the disease and that fatigue and motivation might share neural circuits. It is hypothesized that psychological factors promote fatigue in MS by psychological distress and sustained neuro-endocrine and neurovegetative stress response. Despite there are limitations of data as discussed in the paper, personality research might help to disentangle specific promoting factors of fatigue in MS. Further research efforts are warranted since they might open ways to early psychological intervention of MS-associated fatigue. This is all the more important since medication is insufficient until now.",

Inability to form object representation insures primitive lack of object constancy, resulting in pre-oedipal longing and neediness and malignant affect. Ambivalence towards the sadistic love objective is recognized and allows for a healthier, more complete period of mourning (Freud, 1917). Indeed, depression is banished from family acknowledgement in the service of homeostatic denial. This only reinforces the identified patient's feeling of unreality, shame and guilt over verbalizing the depression and the frequent underlying traumatic history. The enormous role of socio-economic stress is pervasive, yet the focus here is on individuals with complex dynamic constellations which are often ignored in the face of external factors. Addiction as attempt to self-medicate depression and trauma remains the overarching theme.",

Although post-stroke anger (PSA) has been studied relatively less, it can be as frequent as depression. Manifestations of PSA range from overt aggressive behaviors (including hitting or hurting others) to becoming irritable, impulsive, hostile, and less tolerable to family members. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of PSA include neurochemical dysfunction due to brain injury, frustration associated with neurological deficits or unfavorable environments, and genetic predisposition. PSA causes distress in both patients and their caregivers, negatively influences the patient’s quality of life, and increases the burden on caregivers. It can be treated or prevented using various methods, including pharmacological therapies. In addition, anger or hostility may also be a risk or triggering factor for stroke. The hazardous effects of anger may be mediated by other risk factors, including hypertension or diabetes mellitus. The identification of anger as a result or cause of stroke is important because strategic management of anger may help improve the patient’s quality of life or prevent stroke occurrence. In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, prevalence, factors or predictors, relevant lesion locations, and pharmacological treatment of PSA. We further describe the current evidence on anger as a risk or triggering factor for stroke.",

      "title": "Fibromyalgia or pseudo fibromyalgia? - We have to get it right",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain disorders like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, repetitive strain injury and myofascial pain syndromes are no more considered as ‘waste basket diagnosis’, especially because of better biological understanding of these disorders including their immunological and genetic links.1-3 Patients truly suffering from these illnesses, therefore, need to be recognised correctly. Missing these peculiar illnesses and thereby messing them up by misdiagnosing as more serious ailments like Rheumatoid arthritis, other arthritic conditions, connective tissue diseases, psychiatric illnesses or malingering are expensive errors. An equally expensive error is labelling these close mimics and other pseudo fibromyalgia states as fibromyalgia. In both the scenarios, implications can be clinical (progression of an undiagnosed illness), pharmacological (toxicity of an unwarranted drug therapy) economic, emotional, social or even legal. Unfortunately, these errors are made by General practitioners, Physicians, orthopedicians, Psychiatrists and by Rheumatologists alike.4 Syndromic approach to diagnosis of illnesses relies upon physical signs and investigations to a large extent. In pain disorders like fibromyalgia, however, the vague, ‘out of proportion’ tenderness on minor pressure or even a gentle touch may be the only other notable feature apart from the widespread aches complained by the patient. There is no ‘tell-tale’ sign elicitable by inspection, palpation, percussion or auscultation for this spectrum of illnesses. Laboratory investigations always draw a blank. Chronic pain disorders, therefore, cannot be diagnosed by this conventional approach.5 Although chronic wide spread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and mental fogging are some of the hallmarks of these illnesses, familiarity with classification criteria is a prerequisite to identify a good number of them. There are patients, however, with these illnesses that do not fulfill any criteria. Neurochemical misbalances, rather than anatomical lesions are more likely to cause these disorders; nor are they straightforward psychiatric illnesses, in spite of many reports of mind-body link in these conditions.6, 7 While rheumatology clinics in the western and developed world are flooded with such patients and rheumatologists in those parts of the world are more familiar with these illnesses, developing world is less familiar with these maladies. Now that the epidemic seems to be reaching the less developed world, many unanswered questions need to be addressed on this subject. Is it globalization that is bringing it to the developing world, where people earlier could tolerate small aches and pains better? Is it much less common amongst the underprivileged section of the society? Do lifestyle, dietary factors and other socioeconomic factors have some influence on pain threshold, if not on causation of these new world diseases? Painful disorders with anatomical lesions like inflammatory arthropathies, connective tissue diseases and osteoarthritis may also cause vicious cycle of ‘pain begetting more pain’, which may be termed as secondary fibromyalgia.8 On the contrary and paradoxically enough, there is a paradigm shift in the understanding of pain disorders; it is now believed widely that pain itself can cause localised inflammation in a significant proportion of cases and thereby induces this novel mechanism to perpetuate the vicious cycle of pain.9 Whether this has a therapeutic implication is arguable, but breaking this cycle is important in arresting the pain process. Mimics of fibromyalgia comprise a wide spectrum. On the one end, there are highly treatable low grade metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency causing chronic widespread pain. These relatively common disorders need to be excluded or diagnosed and treated, as the case may be, in a chronic pain scenario.10 On the other end of this spectrum, there are more serious organic pathologies like enthesopathic pain of spondyloarthropathies and at times, out of proportion pain and tenderness of leukemic arthropathies, especially in children presenting as vague aches and pains. Attending physician need to be sensitized to avoid misdiagnosing these conditions as fibromyalgia. Last, but not the least, undiagnosed cases of psychiatric illnesses including depression and malin-gering for social, emotional or economic gains can also present as ‘pseudofibromyalgia’.11, 12 The Chinese study in this issue by Rong MU et al. has revealed poor awareness and deficiency in diagnostic skills amongst doctors including rheumatologists and is a must- read article for all. Some of the points discussed in the preceding paragraphs are realised in this paper. Many rheumatologists who considered themselves non-believers of this vague entity in the recent past, have now turned into believers in view of emerging evidences cited above. No rheumatologist can afford to make a mistake today in diagnosing or excluding these modern day illnesses.",

      "title": "Pruritus Ani",
      "abstract": "Summary Pruritus ani, although it presents as the only symptom, never occurs alone, but is associated with bizarre gastrointestinal symptoms and sexual disorders. Depressive and paranoid trends are common. It is the leading symptom in a syndrome. This syndrome exists in its own right. No distinct personality type could be established; it was found to occur without personality disorder, in psychoneurotic and prepsychotic personalities, and in frank psychoses. Its origin can be traced to a reactivation in adult life of infantile (unconscious) fantasies about procreation centering round the anal function, which precede genital interest and knowledge of sex. These \"cloacal\" fantasies are revived in their original primitive mode, as bodily sensations rather than ideas; the symptoms thus represent the fantasy. They appear as distressing somatic symptoms because such archaic fantasies are incompatible with reality. A breakthrough into consciousness is thus prevented and psychotic delusions avoided. Revival of procreation fantasies must be more deeply disturbing in the man than in the woman; this is borne-out by the greater severity, longer duration, and preponderance of male cases. The syndrome is capable of reduction by psychotherapy. The structure of this syndrome is simpler than that of the psychoneuroses. By the absence of overt anxiety it can be separated from anxiety hysteria, and by the absence of true obsessions, with their tendency to displacement and spread, from obsessive-compulsive neurosis. Secondary gain is absent. Its psychopathology suggests a hypochondriacal syndrome with specific content. Freud classed hypochondria among the \"actualneuroses\" to which psychoanalysis had little to contribute. In psychiatry proper hypochondria is also a stepchild. Brachet speaks of it as a \"disorder of the imagination.\" Gillespie8 defines \"the syndrome of hypochondria\" as, \"A mental preoccupation with a real or supposititious physical or mental disorder, a discrepancy between the degree of preoccupation and the grounds for it, so that the former is far in excess of what is justified, and an affective condition best described as interest with conviction and consequent concern, and with an indifference to the opinion of the environment, including irresponsiveness to persuasion… usually inaccessible to psychotherapy… it affects men predominantly… it can shade into schizophrenia… in its mild form it is often erroneously diagnosed as anxiety neurosis or hysteria.\" This description neatly condenses our findings on patients with pruritus ani. It should perhaps be added that in the clinical example given by Gillespie of hypochondria there was, besides intestinal symptoms of \"a bizarre nature\" and \"persecutory ideas of a peculiar kind referring to his gullet and genital organs, \" also \"a tearing away at the anus.\"",

Next to sociopathy these disorders have traditionally been regarded as constituting one of the most difficult classes of psychological problems to treat; certainly they present an exceptionally low rate of success. By contrast with the usual insight psychotherapy, behavior therapy usually focuses on the symptoms alone, with little attention to any underlying intrapsychic or environmental conditions that presumably maintain the symptom. Behavior therapy ignores, in short, the total personality or lifestyle. This symptom specificity of treatment has rendered behavioral approaches subject to criticism from practitioners of more traditional approaches. In more recent years, newer techniques and strategies of behavior therapy have rendered some of those criticisms obsolete.

      "title": "Mania Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition in the brain. A 29-year-old housewife with secondary mania related to multiple sclerosis is described. The case highlights the importance of considering organic causes in treating patients with mania, especially when there are unexplained neurological findings and cognitive dysfunction. The case also illustrates the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging for investigating organic causes of secondary mania and psychosis. Key words: Bipolar disorder, Case report, Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Multiple sclerosis Mania sometimes occurs in association with an organic condition. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode according to DSM-IV requires a distinct period of persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 4 days, with at least 3 associated symptoms, such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in pleasurable activities. The diagnosis of a hypomanic episode must be distinguished from a mood disorder due to a general medical condition. Very often, the florid psychopathology can obscure subtle neurological/physical signs and symptoms, and make the diagnosis of the underlying organic conditions difficult. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a particularly devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS); a patient's presenting symptoms and the temporal evolution of the clinical findings may suggest the correct diagnosis. In relapsing-remitting MS--the type present in 80% of patients--symptoms and signs typically evolve over a period of several days, stabilise, and then often improve, spontaneously or with treatment, within weeks. Relapsing-remitting MS has a peak age of onset of 20 to 40 years and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1. This type of MS typically starts with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, clumsiness, gait apraxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel symptoms. Twenty percent of affected patients have primary progressive MS, while others may develop persistent neurological signs after relapse and the disease may progress between relapses (secondary progressive MS). Prominent cortical signs (aphasia, apraxia, recurrent seizures, visual field loss, and early dementia) and extrapyramidal phenomena (chorea and rigidity) only rarely dominate the clinical picture. Eventually, cognitive impairment, depression, emotional lability, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, progressive quadriparesis, and other CNS manifestations become troublesome. The diagnosis is based on established clinical, and when necessary, laboratory criteria. The most widely used diagnostic criteria are Poser's criteria. (1) Very recently, a new criterion developed by McDonald has been found to enable earlier diagnosis in a group of patients with one demyelinating syndrome. (2) It may become widely used in the near future. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), findings of multifocal lesions of various ages, especially those involving the periventricular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and the spinal cord white matter, support the clinical impression. The presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI indicates current sites of presumed inflammatory demyelination (active lesions). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity, oligoclonal bands may be present, or the synthesis of immunogobulin G (IgG) may be increased. Physiological evidence of subclinical dysfunction of optic nerves and spinal cord (changes in visual evoked responses and somatosensory evoked potentials) may further support the diagnosis. A case of a 29-year-old married woman with secondary hypomanic features associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) is presented, along with a review of the subject. …",

The term rolling effect or rolling mechanism is used as well. The dissociation of tissue layers with other epiphenomenon occurs. The presented group of 152 décollement determined in 103 autopsy cases during the 4 years period comprises the observation of décollement of different etiology of the injuries (traffic accidents, falls from the high, compression of the torso); in the traffic accidents the occurrence in various participants of the traffic, not only in the case of the collision of the pedestrians with various traffic vehicles, but also in drivers of various traffic vehicles, and fellow-travelers as well. The topic, the localization, the content, the extent, and vital reaction and combination injuries were followed-up. According to the variability of the injury etiology, not restricted to the traditional conception of the décollement mechanism, it is obvious that the passed on rule by far is not covering the whole content of this concept. We didn't find any alternative interpretation of until now presented mechanism in the literature. The medical literature focuses mostly on the clinical aspect of this injury. In this paper, the biomechanics of the décollement origin also in case of the tissue compression by the pressure applied perpendicularly to the body surface, the dependences on physical properties of the actively or passively affecting object, the relevance of the ratio of the tissue structures compression in one direction and transversal dilation in other two directions according to the Poisson's constant, the question of tangential factor of the force in case of vertical falling on the horizontal plane, and biomechanical relations in case of body landing on an oblique surface are discussed. The mechanism of décollement is more complex as presented until now. The forensic interpretation of findings should reflex the above-mentioned facts.",

      "abstract": "Pain has often been regarded merely as a symptom that serves as a passive warning signal of an underlying disease process. Using this model, the goal of treatment has been to identify and address the pathology causing pain in the expectation that this would lead to its resolution. However, there is accumulating evidence to indicate that persistent pain cannot be regarded as a passive symptom. Continuing nociceptive inputs result in a multitude of consequences that impact on the individual, ranging from changes in receptor function to mood dysfunction, inappropriate cognitions, and social disruption. These changes that occur as a consequence of continuing nociceptive inputs argue for the consideration of persistent pain as a disease entity in its own right. As with any disease, the extent of these changes is largely determined by the internal and external environments in which they occur. Thus genetic, psychological and social factors may all contribute to the perception and expression of persistent pain. Optimal outcomes in the management of persistent pain may be achieved not simply by attempting to remove the cause of the pain, but by addressing both the consequences and contributors that together comprise the disease of persistent pain.",

Investigations to determine whether there might have been some injury causing brain damage reveal nothing. The child had a normal, full-term birth, with no resuscitation necessary. His psychomotor development was physiologically normal and without complications. His intelligence and scholastic achievements are normal. The most extensive tests always give negative results. Only the electroencephalogram (EEG) may show disturbance, but not always. Typical losses of consciousness are reflected the EEG if it is a case of petit mal. But these EEG tracings, whether recorded during or between seizures, give no clues whatever to etiology. The child or adolescent is then treated symptomatically. He will be re-examined later. The subsequent course varies. Sometimes seizures or blackouts cease under the effects of treatment. In other cases, new seizures occur at more or less long intervals, so that treatment must be modified or intensified. The patient will never, throughout his life, provide concrete evidence of any organic damage. This person is then classified as epileptic; and view of the absence of any discernible lesion as cause, the term is qualified by essential or idiopathic.

A growing body of evidence suggests that ME/CFS may be caused by a dysfunction of the stress system—the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in particular—as a result of chronic stress. ME/CFS shares many similarities to occupational burnout and overtraining syndrome, including similar symptoms, physiological abnormalities, and triggers.After a brief review of the science of stress, burnout, overtraining, central fatigue, and ME/CFS, we propose a model of ME/CFS based on a state of persistent burnout that remains after the initial stressors have been removed. This persistence may be due to a combination of a dysregulation of the ANS and HPA axis, behavioural factors, and negative feedback from the illness itself.",

      "title": "Other Uses: Psychosis, Pregnancy, and Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Although ECT was developed as a treatment for schizophrenia, its ease of use, its safety, and the lack of effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions encouraged experimentation with this therapy to treat other disorders. These explorations define a cluster of conditions— acute and chronic psychosis, psychiatric disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and intractable seizure disorders—in which ECT has a clinical role. Strongly held beliefs (delusions), abnormal sensory experiences (hallucinations, illusions) that are not based upon reality, and beliefs that others are paying special attention or plotting harm to the subject (paranoid thoughts) impair social functioning and disrupt family life. Thought disorders are the central peculiarity of schizophrenia but are also frequently found in patients with depression, mania, toxic states, and brain disorders. Regardless of the cause or the associated signs and symptoms, treatment can reduce the psychosis. This benefit is often given small notice, however, because ECT is widely regarded as an antidepressant, not an antipsychotic, treatment. The relief of psychosis afforded by ECT varies with the underlying condition. Disorders in thought in patients with depression or mania are readily relieved. Indeed, the more severe form of psychotic depression is relieved more rapidly than nonpsychotic depression. When ECT is used to treat patients with malignant catatonia and delirium, the psychosis is relieved at the same time as the toxic state. When psychosis dominates the clinical condition without other features, schizophrenia is the usual diagnosis. For acute schizophrenia dominated by the positive symptoms of paranoia, catatonia, or excitement, ECT is quite helpful. It is not helpful for the chronic varieties dominated by passivity and withdrawal, the negative signs of the illness. The clinical approach to the diagnosis of a psychotic condition is to exclude other causes for psychosis first and reserve the label “schizophrenia” for the residue of “not otherwise diagnosed” psychotic conditions. While we are able to ameliorate the psychoses in mood disorders and toxic states, palliation and symptom reduction are the best that we can offer other psychotic patients. Electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy were the main treatments for psychosis at the time when Thorazine and other new antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950s.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

      "title": "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE INTEGRATED CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN",
      "abstract": "In the holistic approach in medicine а person is viewed through the bio-psycho-social model. Human health is a trinity of “soma” (body), “psyche” (soul) and social role (position) that are constantly interacting with each other and with the environment. Any action on one of the dimensions inevitably affects the others. Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. They cause social, economic and psychological burden for individuals, their families and the whole society. Much of the socially significant diseases (especially cancer and degenerative diseases) are associated with chronic pain. Epidemiological data shows that between 10.1% and 55.2% of people in different countries suffer from chronic pain. Pain has been shown to affect all dimensions of health related to quality of life. Patients with chronic pain also suffer from depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Limitation of physical activity leads to overweight and all additional health risks related to this condition. Depression, inability to work, impaired social contacts and suicidal thoughts make chronic pain a public health problem. Drug medication along with psychological support and social commitment are important elements of holistic integrated care for patients with chronic pain.The purpose of this article is to analyze the ethical considerations of integrative care for patients with chronic pain.In modern medical ethics autonomy is basic principle. In bioethics autonomy means “the capacity to make an informed, uncoerced decision for your health”. To participate in the decision-making process patients, need sufficient and comprehensive information. The right to information is a basic patient’s right and obligation of the physician. The partnership model is of great importance in the treatment of chronic diseases. The patient is engaged as part of the therapeutic team, actively participates in the healing process and implements self-management of the disease. Numerous studies have proven that patient involvement improves medical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in healthcare. The communication between the doctor and the patient is a cornerstone and a premise for quality medical care.In conclusion, in the age of high-tech medicine, the human factor and patient-centered care have remained intact. Good awareness of patients is of key importance for their participation in the treatment. Easily available, true and relevant information is a prerequisite for understanding the pain control options.",

Considering the burden of mental health disorders and the lack of efficacy of available treatments, there is a need for biomarkers to predict tailored or personalized treatments. However, identifying reliable biomarkers for complex mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, has been challenging, likely owing to the heterogeneity, comorbidity and differences in experiences and histories of individuals. For these reasons, taking a transdiagnostic approach, which identifies biomarkers that map onto shared symptoms/constructs across disorders could be most effective for informing personalized or precision medicine approaches in psychiatry. Transdiagnostic features of anxiety, depression and anhedonia have been examined in relation to brain activity and connectivity patterns. Neuroendocrine and inflammatory markers, which are altered in depression and other comorbid illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), might be useful in differentiating transdiagnostic symptom profiles as well as treatment responses. Ultimately, biomarker research that looks beyond diagnostic categories and embraces the complexity of individuals' lives and experiences might be more effective in moving towards precision medicine in psychiatry.",

They may aggravate psychiatric disorders, perpetuate them or predict a disease onset, like in depressive or manic episodes. Also in organic sleep disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders or nocturnal movement disorders, increased anxiety or depression scores may be observed. Patients suffering from sleep disorders do not only experience impaired well-being, but also show deteriorations in cognition and performance, have a higher risk of accidents, are generally more prone to health problems, have a higher sickness absence rate, seek medical help more often and thus are also an important socioeconomic factor. This is why sleep disorders should be taken seriously and treated adequately.",

Functional somatic illness may express underlying psychiatric disorders (e.g. fibromyalgia due to non-fearful panic disorder, irritable bowel syndrome due to bipolar disorder). Sustained physiological activation caused by stressful life events combined with catastrophic thinking may be another cause. Functional somatic illness may also be caused by classic conditioning of physiological responses that may have been triggered by biological or emotional stimuli. Operant conditioning may also be a cause. The therapeutic alliance relies on acceptance of the reality of the subjective complaints, without a priori acceptance of the patient's attribution of the cause of the symptoms. We recommend initial exploration of the patient's own ideas about aetiology, including appropriate medical tests. The physician should then change the agenda to a biopsychosocial perspective and identify current stressors and psychosocial variables that reinforce symptoms. Only a few randomised trials have been performed. They suggest that psychological treatment should be systematic and structured, with a focus on information, alternative ways of perception, and problem solving.

      "abstract": "Background: In some medical cases, psychotic symptoms can be part of the clinical picture, and sometimes it can even be the only clinical appearance of the medical condition. Psychotic disorders secondary to organic pathologies affecting the central nervous system are called psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. While some of these secondary causes can easily be detected by laboratory and imaging methods, anamnesis or neurological examination (substance use, trauma, and tumors), others are often overlooked in the presence of rare medical conditions (autoimmune disease and viral encephalitis), when laboratory and examination findings are not clear and psychiatric symptoms are in the foreground. Case Presentation: In this case, we tried to reveal the differential diagnosis and treatment processes of a patient who was admitted to the emergency department with psychotic symptoms, such as agitation, aggression, and paranoid delusions, and was admitted to the psychiatry clinic after an urgent medical evaluation. After his admission to the psychiatry clinic, the medical evaluation of the patient was re-evaluated in detail due to memory and orientation deterioration, and as a result, clinical pictures such as Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, herpes encephalitis, and epileptic seizures were found to be together in the patient. As a matter of fact, both general medical and psychiatric statuses of the patient improved with the application of low doses and short-term antipsychotic treatment for psychiatric symptoms together with the treatment for this underlying general medical condition. Conclusion: Since the treatment of psychiatric symptoms caused by secondary medical factors is quite different from the treatment of primary psychiatric disorders, it is important to make full medical evaluations, especially in patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms for the first time or presenting with emergency psychiatric symptoms.",

      "title": "Anatomical and Physiological Considerations Prerequisite to Diagnosis of Back Trauma",
      "abstract": "The anatomy of low back pain following injury involves practically the structure of the entire living human body. For the purposes of this paper, the anatomy and physiology of the back will be considered from a broad and not a detailed descriptive point of view. The variable character of low back pain, its multiplicity of causes, the complexity of the anatomic structures involved, and the difficulties in its treatment render this affection one of the most baffling problems that confront the physician. The condition has important industrial and economic aspects. Many persons habitually assume, at work or otherwise, positions seriously at fault mechanically, and sooner or later under the stress and strain the body tissues rebel and backache results, with or without trauma. Industry suffers a severe drain on its man power from this type of affection, since slight traumata may throw on the disabled list for very long periods those whose bodies have been repeatedly insulted by postural errors and the consequent mechanical strain. Exact anatomical knowledge is necessary for accurate diagnosis. In the past, the anatomy of the back has been neglected too frequently by medical students. Since charlatans are most liable to promise relief in fields where medical and anatomic knowledge is deficient, it becomes an obligation on each practitioner to possess knowledge of the anatomy underlying backache following injury. Anatomy of the Human Spine The human spinal column is the central axis of the skeleton and is situated in the median line at the posterior aspect of the trunk. It is normally composed of thirty-three segments or vertebrae, twenty-four of which are true or movable and nine false or fixed vertebrae. Of the true vertebrae, the first seven are called cervical, the succeeding twelve, thoracic or dorsal; the remaining five, lumbar. Of the false vertebrae, the first five form one mass, called the sacrum, and at the terminal part of the column are three to five fused segments forming the coccyx. The vertebral column functions as a pillar of support for the trunk and a case for protection of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and meninges. Cephalad it supports the skull; laterally, it gives attachments to the ribs, through which in part it receives the weight of the upper limbs; caudad it is supported by the hip bones, by which the weight of the trunk is transmitted to the lower limbs. The structure of the whole column accords with the necessities of these functions, and thus the vertebrae of which it is composed show their individual agreement with the general arrangement of the whole: they are modified in details according to their position, but they are all built on the same general principle. This principle may be demonstrated, briefly, by a vertebra taken from the center of the column and used as an illustration of the positions of the chief parts of a “typical” vertebra. In front a strong body carries and transmits weight.",

      "abstract": "This article provides a critical review of the psychological and related literature on fatigue resulting in both mental and physical experiences. On one hand, prolonged severe fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in various diseases of different aetiology – psychiatric (e.g. depression), somatic (e.g. some infections) and neurologic (e.g. multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). For instance, fatigue is a main symptom of myasthenia that leads to pathological skeletal muscle weakness. Furthermore, 40 to 90 per cent of individuals suffering from multiple sclerosis confirm they have experienced fatigue, which impairs their cognitive functioning. In both multiple sclerosis and myasthenia, fatigue has not only a physical but also a psychological dimension. On the other hand, fatigue can be seen as an isolated set of symptoms of unknown origin called the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The development of the concept, diagnostic criteria and some strategies of coping with CFS are presented. Various somatic disorders, as well as subjective cognitive and emotional complaints, are common and well documented in patients with CFS. The most typical include depression, as well as problems with concentration of attention, decision-making and reasoning in complex situations. However, general intellectual abilities and higher order cognitive skills are intact. Directions for future research are outlined.",

      "abstract": "A XXI. század vívmányaként hangoztatják a testi-lelki egészség komplexet, amelynek részeként a sportolók körében is mind nagyobb figyelmet szánnak a szomatikus orvoslás mellett a pszichére is. A sportpszichiátriát húzták elő és állították a teljesítményfokozás szolgálatába akkor is, amikor már valamennyi biológiai fegyvert elpuffogtattak, s a várva várt eredmény még mindig nem jött meg. Sőt, egyre több energiaráfordítás ellenére egyre rosszabbá vált. A sportolók körében több pszichiátriai kórkép hívja fel magára a figyelmet vagy a magas prevalencia, vagy egy-egy specifikus szindróma kialakulása által. A depresszió (versenyzés utáni depresszió, a megmérettetés meghiúsulása utáni depresszió), a krónikus stressz, szorongás, a túledzési szindróma, fáradékonyság, enerváltság, alvászavarok, étkezési zavarok tünetei, a burnout, az evészavarok (anorexia athletica, atlétatriász), személyiségtényezők és a kémiai addikciók mind rendkívül fontosak. A jelen tanulmány elsőként foglalja össze azokat a legfontosabb pszichiátriai kórképeket, amelyek a sportolópopulációban, az egyes sportágak szerint különböző mértékben, nagy jelentőséggel bírhatnak.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

      "title": "[Subjective syndrome after head injury].",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS: Post-traumatic or post-commotion syndrome is one of the most controversial entities in studying consequences of craniocerebral trauma. Part of this problem arises from impossibility of adequate translation of the term brain concussion. Post-concussion syndrome is a broader concept than post-commotion and includes, if not a whole, than part of the post-contusion syndrome. There are also some other terms in the literature: post-traumatic syndrome, post head injury syndrome, post head injury syndrome or symptoms and the old term post-traumatic encephalopathy. Terminological imprecisions have not been solved yet, but the notion itself is determined by relative standard symptoms often associated with closed craniocerebral trauma, but without precise connection with the severity of the trauma. In the classification of mental disorders and behavior disorders, this syndrome is coded as FO7.2.In regard to the etiology of this syndrome some authors speak in favor of psychogenic and some of organic etiology, while Levin considers symptoms of post-commotion syndrome to start as organic and persist as psychic. Wechsler classified subjective disorders after head injuries into 4 categories: simulation, traumatic hysteria, traumatic encephalopathy and traumatic neurosis. The author does not deal with the origin of symptoms, whereas the classification itself suggests priority of psychic to organic factors (11). Those who speak in favor of organic etiology, think that axon damage and neuron damage are organic substrate in mild brain injuries, while fibrous degenerations of the cerebral hemisphere and brain stem are the organic base in severe traumas. On the other hand, many scientists primarily point to psychic moments, especially to importance of aggravation and simulation as well as compensation or rental neurosis in persistent post-traumatic syndrome. Most scientists agree that personality characteristics influence the development of post-traumatic syndrome and can predispose aggravation and simulation, whereas these symptoms more often occur in neurotic persons. The latest investigations reveal that classification in regard to etiologic factors--organic and psychogenic--is an anachronism. Long and Novac state that 80% of persons with cerebral trauma spontaneously speak about symptoms of the post-traumatic syndrome, while by targeted evaluation the percentage rises to 90%, so that they think that universality of symptoms points to their common origin.If the post-traumatic syndrome is though of as a line with organic dementia at one end and traumatic neuroses at the other, then this syndrome can be placed at different positions. Some authors put it close to the neurotic syndrome or regard it to be the neurotic syndrome itself, while others, mostly due to homogenity of the clinical picture, believe that this syndrome has an organic cause.",

Postural tremor is present while voluntarily maintaining a position against gravity (e.g., holding up outstretched arms). Intention tremor occurs when tremor increases as one is approaching a target (e.g., with finger-to-nose movements).

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is a common, disregarded, underdiagnosed, and inadequately treated complaint of both young and adult females. It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen, which start shortly before or at the onset of menses and which could last for 3 days. In particular, PD negatively impacts the quality of life (QOL) of young females and is the main reason behind their absenteeism from school or work. It is suggested that increased intrauterine secretion of prostaglandins F2α and E2 are responsible for the pelvic pain associated with this disorder. Its associated symptoms are physical and/or psychological. Its physical symptoms include headache, lethargy, sleep disturbances, tender breasts, various body pains, disturbed appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and increased urination, whereas its psychological symptoms include mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, and irritability. While its diagnosis is based on patients' history, symptoms, and physical examination, its treatment aims to improve the QOL through the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and/or the use of non-pharmacological aids (e.g., topical heat application and exercise). Patients must be monitored to measure their response to treatment, assess their adherence, observe potential side effects, and perform further investigations, if needed.",

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a complex condition that is characterized by chronic widespread pain and multiple other symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, stiffness, and depressive episodes. Fibromyalgia may coexist and/or overlap with other conditions that may involve central sensitivity, including chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, irritable bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis, and temporomandibular disorder. The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia remains uncertain but is believed to be partly the result of central systems affecting afferent processing as well as impaired endogenous pain-inhibitory systems. Abnormal central nociceptive processing may contribute to fibromyalgia, producing heightened responses to various noxious stimuli with resulting mechanical hyperalgesia. Fibromyalgia remains a clinical diagnosis. There has been a recent paradigm shift away from requiring 11 or more out of 18 tender points and instead focusing on the presence of chronic widespread pain as well as symptoms of fatigue, unrefreshed sleep, and other somatic complaints. Although there is no known cure for fibromyalgia, multidisciplinary team efforts using combined treatment approaches, including patient education, aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic therapies (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [eg, duloxetine, milnacipran] and alpha 2-delta receptor ligands [eg, pregabalin]) may improve symptoms as well as function of patients with fibromyalgia.",

It is determined that injuries are divided into mild and severe. The purpose of the article is to analyze the psychological characteristics of the main categories of severely wounded combatants and to identify the factors that affect their psychological state and the rehabilitation process. The study is aimed at identifying the problems faced by wounded combatants, since the injuries they receive lead not only to physical but also to profound psychological consequences. The study shows that severe injuries of various kinds have a significant impact on the functioning of the nervous system and psyche of combatants. The study focuses on different types of physical injuries (amputations, traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries) and their impact on mental health. Amputations of limbs lead to a violation of the integrity of the body, which significantly affects self-esteem, self-image, and adaptation to life with a disability. In addition to physical limitations, these individuals experience phantom pains, depressive disorders, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress reactions. The results of the study show that severe injuries lead not only to physical limitations, but also to profound psychological consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, aggressiveness, emotional instability and social isolation. These factors significantly complicate their integration into society after returning from war. The article proposes various methods of psychological support that can help improve the psycho-emotional state and overall quality of life of severely wounded. The article emphasizes the importance of further study of this topic for the development of new methods of support and adaptation of combatants in civilian life. The study of the psychological consequences of severe trauma requires a comprehensive approach.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder is a common psychiatric illness that imposes persistent functional impairment and disability on persons who have the disorder. The disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. It is the most prevalent of any anxiety disorder and is the third most common psychiatric disorder after depression and alcohol abuse. Social anxiety disorder typically begins during childhood with a mean age at onset between 14 and 16 years and is sometimes preceded by a history of social inhibition or shyness. Persons who have social anxiety disorder either endure or avoid social situations altogether because the fear of embarrassment causes such intense anxiety; such avoidance may ultimately interfere with occupational and/or social functioning and lead to significant disability. The duration of social anxiety disorder is frequently lifelong, and there is a high degree of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Social anxiety disorder is a serious illness that frequently runs a chronic course and is associated with significant morbidity. Patients should be treated aggressively using pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be tolerated over the long term. Cognitive-behavioral therapy should also be considered in treatment planning. Efforts to increase the recognition of social anxiety disorder as a common, distressing, and disabling condition are critical. This article discusses the comorbidity, neurobiology, and pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder.",

      "title": "Impairment Tutorial: Personality Disorders in Disability Arena",
      "abstract": "Personality disorders are conditions that can complicate impairment and disability assessment. It is important that the evaluating physician recognize these disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)1 defines ten specific personality disorders in addition to an eleventh condition, Personality Disorder NOS, which allows for combined features of the various personality disorders as well as personality conditions which are not specifically listed. The ten listed personality disorders are divided into three clusters.Personality disorders represent enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from those expected by the individual—s culture. These inflexible and pervasive patterns reflect problems with cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning and impulse control, and lead to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. By their very nature, personality disorders are often unrecognized by those who suffer from them, who tend to blame others for their problems. There may be comorbidity with various conditions, such as pain disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse. Personality disorders may be undiagnosed by healthcare providers, which can be particularly troublesome when disability benefits are involved.These personality disorders are occasionally present in people involved in litigation. Of this group, Paranoid Personality Disorder, in which a person suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploitative, harmful, or deceitful, is probably the most common in the legal arena. Such people tend to bear grudges, read hidden meaning into benign remarks, and to believe that their reputations are under attack. The other Cluster A personality disorders result in significant social detachment or isolation and are less likely to be present in plaintiffs or workers—compensation claimants.These personality disorders are more prevalent in the legal arena, perhaps because people suffering from these conditions feel comfortable with and may seek to be the focus of attention. Of this group, probably the most prevalent disorder in the legal disability arena is borderline personality. Such people may suffer from frantic efforts to avoid perceived abandonment, patterns of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, an identity disturbance, and impulsivity. They may exhibit suicidal behavior, gestures, and threats, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, intense displays of anger, transient dissociative symptoms, and stress-related paranoid ideation. Histrionic individuals have a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking behavior. Narcissistic individuals have a pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Antisocial individuals have long-term disregard for the rights of others. In my experience, legal issues involving individuals with cluster B personality disorders often involve determination of causation of the person—s problems, an assessment of claims of harassment, and an assessment of the person—s fitness for employment.These disorders also are encountered in legal situations. Obsessive-compulsive personality disordered individuals who may have functioned at a high professional level, such as in the legal and medical professions, may be seeking disability benefits through private or group disability insurance plans. Dependent personality disordered patients encounter difficulty making everyday decisions; they tend to let others assume responsibility, have trouble with self-assertion, and have excessive need for nurturance and support. Such individuals—psychological need to be cared for perpetuates a disabled posture with respect to family and medical caregivers. These underlying issues tend to reinforce chronic pain syndromes and perpetuate claims for disability benefits, leading to potential diagnostic dilemmas concerning the cause of ongoing problems.The following case vignettes, which are composites of various case histories, help to illustrate these points.A thirty-five year old sawmill worker suffered a partial index and ring finger amputation in his non-dominant hand. He had suffered two prior significant accidents while working elsewhere in his twenties. In one of those accidents, he sustained a lumbar compression fracture when he fell from a platform; in the other, a mild traumatic brain injury when he was struck by falling pieces of lumber. After all of the injuries, there was a pattern of prolonged disability, chronic pain behavior, narcotics dependence, and increased explosive and threatening behavior.The injured worker gave a history of conflict with others since early adolescence. He had a history of mistrust, believing that others were cheating him and that his wife was unfaithful. Although greatly perturbed by his wife—s unsubstantiated infidelity, he was not at all concerned about the impact on his wife and children of his own infidelity. His accusations caused considerable turmoil at home. He had a long history of believing that he was being persecuted by his employers, family, police, neighbors, and acquaintances, lacking insight into the provocative nature of his own behavior. He thought that others tampered with his equipment at work and deliberately miscalculated his work output in order to cheat him, even though there was no supporting evidence. He had a history of recurrent fights, exacerbated by alcoholism and narcotics use, and of friction with the police.The evaluee suffered from Personality Disorder NOS with marked paranoid features, and this significantly colored his reaction to his traumatic amputation. His tendency to blame others for an accident that was due to his own misjudgment, his turbulent relationships at work, and his belief that he was being persecuted by the employer and coworkers severely impacted his ability to return to work and to be rehabilitated. His psychological problems were due to his underlying personality disorder, exacerbated by both substance abuse and the work injury. In the particular jurisdiction in which he was evaluated, the worsening of his psychological condition due to his work injury was deemed compensable by the workers—compensation hearing officer.A thirty-one year old woman was sexually harassed by a male supervisor in a factory where she was employed for seven months. The harassment began with occasional sexual comments, which at first seemed casual. When the remarks were not met with firm rejection, the supervisor escalated his behavior and made the employee feel very uncomfortable.At the time of the harassment, the employee was going through a divorce and a custody battle. Her husband, a cocaine dealer, had been released from prison one year previously. The evaluee had two prior failed marriages, both to jealous, abusive, controlling individuals. Her current husband seemed more interested in retribution for an affair that she had had when he was imprisoned than in working or providing for their two children.The employee had a long history of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships. She had a history since adolescence of mood swings with recurrent periods of anxiety, depression, and stress-related paranoid thinking. She had a pattern of self-abusive behavior, recurrently burning herself with matches and superficially cutting her forearms, abdomen, and legs with razor blades. The repetitive burning caused keloid formation on her forearms, which served to exacerbate her negative self-perception. She was perceived as flirtatious and often wore halter-tops and low-cut blouses to work, even in winter.The employee had a history of ongoing cocaine abuse and a past history of amphetamine addiction. She had a history of multiple failed relationships and impulsive behavior, but was socially engaging. She was perceived by others as a fun person when things were going well, but was quick to react with rage and feel abandoned. At such times, she contemplated suicide, and had a history of two brief psychiatric hospitalizations for overdoses. She had been in outpatient psychotherapy off and on since her teens, with four different therapists, and had been prescribed various benzodiazepines (which she abused) and antidepressants.In this case, the person—s psychological difficulties were due to a borderline personality disorder and substance abuse. The job-related sexual harassment was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but was not determined to be the cause of her psychological difficulties.",

      "title": "Burnout: Hintergründe, Konzepte, Perspektiven",
      "abstract": "Burnout, historically the successor to neurasthenia, is considered an exhaustion phenomenon caused by prolonged work-related stress. The very concept of \"being burned out\" implies an image that is immediately understandable and concise to any layperson. Academic psychiatry and psychology pose conceptual challenges to this popular model, which was first published in 1974 by the German-American psychotherapist Herbert Freudenberger. To date, more than 140 definitions of burnout have been proposed. All of the main features of burnout, especially the experience of exhaustion, are non-specific. Various burnout development models have been proposed, which were assumed to represent a quasi-natural process. None could be confirmed empirically. An expert consensus on the diagnostic criteria and conceptual classification, whether as an independent disorder or as a risk condition, could not be achieved. Nevertheless, burnout is classified as a work-related disorder in the ICD-11. Current findings indicate that the experience of burnout among members of the baby boomer generation often reflects their high performance expectations of themselves, while the identical subjective feeling in Generation Z is often associated with missing or unsustainable professional goals. The research on the burnout phenomenon, which largely ignores the fact that burnout - in the absence of reliable diagnostic criteria - must be considered a subjective model, meets social expectations but does not meet scientific criteria. A parallel recording of ICD/DSM diagnoses and subjective disorder models is recommended in everyday therapeutic practice in order to meet the needs of both sides.",

Even emotional ventilation, such as crying, is sometimes said to be depression. I often hear suggestions of ventilating one’s feelings or performing leisure activities to get rid of depression. Although, the importance of emotional ventilation can never be understated in order to manage mental health, according to the WHO, depression is a mental disorder that is identified by a loss of pleasure or interest in daily activities for a long period of time, the causes of which may vary from physical or emotional abuse to severe losses in life. Depression needs to be diagnosed and treated, whereas the misuse of the term may lead to misidentification and the illusion that talking to loved ones and getting indulged in one’s favourite activities can cure it.",

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

Objectives Increase knowledge about paraphrenia, a classic diagnosis that no longer appears on international classifications. Methods Extensive research on the historical path of the paraphrenia diagnostic entity was carried out. Patient’s data is obtained from medical history and psychiatric interviews done during her hospitalizations. Results 68 year-old patient attended the hospital emergency service due to a demonic possession delusion that emerged when she was 44 year-old, when she first consulted a psychiatrist because she believed someone introduced the demon inside her body. She described kinesthetic hallucinations as “movements of her brain” and an intense headache, both originated by the demon; as well as other types of hallucinations and confabulations. However, there was no deterioration in her personaliy or her intellectual capacity, as it could have been seen in a case of schizophrenia. This clinical case is considered a paraphrenia phantastica as it presents the typical features raised by the classic authors (mainly Henry Ey): paralogical thought dominance, megalomania, confabulation and integrity of relation with reality. Conclusions Current internacional classifications do not consider paraphrenia as a differentiated diagnostic entity, as it also occurs with other classical entities. This causes a loss of important tools that would achieve a better approach to the patient’s condition. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

Mental health is assessed on a continuum, ranging from languishing to flourishing. Languishing has been described as feeling uninspired, joyless, and lacking the power to function at full capacity. And languishing may increase your risk of mental illness, such as major depressive episode, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, or substance use disorder. Lawyers may suffer from several obstacles to mental strength, including lack of self-awareness, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, social comparisons, trained pessimism, inability to regulate emotions, and inauthenticity from a failure to understand or leverage their temperament and personality strengths.

      "title": "The Clinical and Roentgenographic Interpretation of Lumbosacral Anomalies",
      "abstract": "THE significance of lumbosacral anomalies is closely related to certain clinical concepts which, in turn, have distinct bearing on the treatment. For this reason, these clinical concepts and treatment will be discussed before the various common anomalies are described. Lumbosacral anomalies produce symptoms only through faulty mechanics. Faulty support or faulty relationship produces abnormal stresses or pressures. Whether an anomaly is of faulty support or of faulty relationship, its mechanical weakness can be compensated by muscles and ligaments. As long as these soft tissues are of sufficient strength and tone to meet the conditions without fatigue, there are no symptoms—the patient is compensated. Muscles and ligaments that are thus occupied in supporting or protecting the lumbosacral area have less than normal capacity for meeting extraneous loads or stresses, as a certain portion of their total capacity is already in use. Hence these tissues are more liable to strain than the normal; that is, their capacity to meet stresses is more liable to be exceeded, in which event the patient is decompensated and must be relieved by rest in order that these injured tissues may recover and regain a state of compensation. Decompensation occurs in several ways: (1) There may be an excessive extraneous load or stress directly producing a strain. (2) As one grows older, muscles lose tone and power, so that the person who is well compensated at 20 may, at 40, have his muscle power exceeded by stresses which were easily met at 20. Accordingly, decompensation is more frequent later in life. (3) One's routine may change from a physically active to a sedentary life. The muscles which were of good power and tone rapidly become weaker and poorer in tone so that muscles which, in the period of activity, could meet severe stresses, in the sedentary period are not equal to meeting even moderate stresses, and decompensation occurs on some slight injury. Women lead a fairly active life up to the time of marriage but on the average are much more sedentary thereafter. This, I believe, is the reason that backache of lumbosacral origin is so common among women, while many laborers who do heavy work, with muscles of good tone and power, escape it. (4) Muscles able to meet considerable stress when prepared for it may offer little resistance if caught unprepared. The person with a lumbosacral anomaly may do heavy work with no difficulty and yet develop an acute strain with some sudden twist or turn for which the protective muscles are not prepared. (5) Muscles that are being used constantly for protection while the patient is erect may become fatigued. Fatigued muscles may ache. This is a minor form of decompensation without acute strain but with definite low-back fatigue. Some patients, not having known any other condition, may not realize that they are fatigued. Such persons are apt to lead a sedentary life merely because they do not feel equal to anything else. Often the adolescent child who is lazy, sedentary, or a book-worm has adopted that habit because of a lumbosacral anomaly which produces chronic fatigue.",

The grief reactions can be divided into stress-specific reactions (typical, chronic, inhibited, and delayed grief) and non-specific and mixed reactions (distorted grief). It is especially in the latter group the diagnostical difficulties show up. The reason is, that the symptomatology in these cases is very diffuse and the clinical picture may look like many other psychiatric diseases. A case with the clinical picture of depression caused by pathological grief is discussed in relationship to other kinds of depression. Regarding psychiatric patients it is often difficult to unveil the trauma/loss. In some patients there will be more than one loss, and the problem is to find out which one has caused the symptoms. Besides, sometimes the traumatic loss is unconscious. In order to unveil the trauma we have used a combined physio-psychotherapy, which in the uncovering phase is characterized by a therapeutic non-directive attitude, where the patient is grounded, relaxed, concentrated, and as close to himself as possible in order to facilitate thoughts, emotions, body sensations etc. to emerge. When you have identified the type of loss, the therapy follows the basic principles: The inhibited emotions must be expressed and painful situations must be repeated until the emotions are extinguished. During the therapy the psychiatric patient will be in danger of becoming psychotic or committing suicide, and often it has been necessary to apply psychopharmaca to accomplish the therapy, even if many authors warn against it. The difficulties of treating hospitalized patients with pathological grief are to my opinion counterbalanced by the advantages of the in-patient psychiatric department, where you have the possibility of using various kinds of professionals, whose combined methods of treatment may ensure a successful therapy.Key Words: Pathological griefpsychotherapy",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

The victim, as the recipient of the rapist's anger and need to control, experiences terror, fear of death, and helplessness. This results in classic posttraumatic symptoms of haunting, intrusive recollections, numbing or constriction of feelings and focus, and increased arousal. When this psychological trauma is not integrated, anxiety, depression, phobias, impaired sexual and social adjustment, negative self-image, and diminished capacity to enjoy life follow. Concepts of posttraumatic stress are reviewed and a definition of sexual assault is offered. The posttraumatic stress response to sexual assault is considered under the phases of response and symptoms, followed by the psychodynamics of this particular psychic trauma. A brief overview of treatment is outlined.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that cognitive and behavioral interventions have enduring effects that reduce risk for subsequent symptom return following treatment termination. These enduring effects have been most clearly demonstrated with respect to depression and the anxiety disorders. It remains unclear whether these effects are a consequence of the amelioration of the causal processes that generate risk or the introduction of compensatory strategies that offset them and whether these effects reflect the mobilization of cognitive or other mechanisms. No such enduring effects have been observed for the psychoactive medications, which appear to be largely palliative in nature. Other psychosocial interventions remain largely untested, although claims that they produce lasting change have long been made. Whether such enduring effects extend to other disorders remains to be seen, but the capacity to reduce risk following treatment termination is one of the major benefits provided by the cognitive and behavioral interventions with respect to the treatment of depression and the anxiety disorders.",

      "title": "Validation of Stress Assessment Using Mobile Phone",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONStress is a universally experienced phenomenon. It represents a continuum which no single definition can encompass. Stress is considered as an external load or demand on a biological, social or psychological system (Lazarus, 1993). In general terms, stress is defined as the reaction of an organism to a change in its equilibrium. More commonly it is referred to, as, the tension one experiences in response to a threat (Lu et al., 2012). Cumulative stress in daily life impacts negatively on health and societal well-being. Stress being highly pervasive, is widely accepted as the leading cause of illness and diseases. This presents an inherent need to detect and monitor stress as a pre-requisite for eliminating stress and diseases caused due to stress. Yet, despite the scientific advances of modern times, stress continues to be measured only through a self declared questionnaire. Such a questionnaire has several limitations, including lack of portability to measure frequently.Physiologic responses to stress could be used as markers to quantify stress. As a rule, stress does not exist in the absence of stressors. Stressors are stimuli which evoke stress responses. They could be real or imagined, physical or psychological. Physical stressors pose a threat to a person's physical equilibrium such as an electric shock, prolonged exercise, or deprivation of sleep. A psychological stressor on the other hand could be an event that poses a threat to an individual's self-esteem, e.g., the pressure of solving a difficult mental task within a time limit (Lu et al., 2012). It has been recognized that all stressors, whether physical or psychological elicit the same physiological response. Among the various physiological responses to stress such as, changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature, respiration, skin conductance etc., cortisol responses function as the chief biomarker of stress. Largest cortisol responses entailing longest time for recovery are found to occur as a result of acute psychological stressors. (Dickerson and Kenney, 2004) These stressors refer to tasks of motivated performance (public speaking and mental arithmetic) with both uncontrollable and social evaluative elements (i.e., task performance could be negatively judged by others) present in them.On the other hand, it has been widely acknowledged (Hecker, Stevens, von Bismarck and Williams, 1968, Scherer, 1986., Tolkmitt and Scherer, 1986) that human voice is influenced by stress. According to Chang, Fischer and Canny (2011) the human voice encodes a wealth of information about emotion, mood and mental state. Variations in speaking fundamental frequency, duration (Griffin and Williams, 1987) amplitude (Brenner and Shipp, 1987) etc., provide for changes in acoustic speech signal that are measured as correlates of stress. Alterations in acoustic signals could be an outcome of changes in respiration during stress. Rate of respiration increases during stress, as a result, sub glottal pressure increases during speech. This in turn increases fundamental frequency or pitch of voice. Increased rate of respiration decreases duration of speech between breaths. Dryness of mouth, activity of the muscles of the larynx, vibrating vocal cords affect the volume velocity through the glottis and thereby fundamental frequency which contribute to changes in speech production under stress. These facts tender human voice as a potential source for stress detection. Voice features that could be influenced by stress include loudness, fundamental frequency, jitter, zero-crossing rate, speech rate and high-energy frequency ratio (Rothkrantz, Wiggers, van Wees and van Vark, 2004). Utilizing these facts the stressMobile-a tool developed to assess stress, demonstrates the possibility of quantifying stress levels from voice features recorded in a mobile phone.The present investigation was conducted to validate stress assessment using stressMobile against salivary cortisol responses to psychologically induced stress task on a sample of university students. …",

The threshold for perceiving the internal body state as abnormal varies and depends particularly on psychological influences. As a result, a symptom can either reflect pathology, whether serious or not, or be generated wholly psychologically. Intuition allowing discrimination between these possibilities is central to the physician9s art. Particular difficulty arises in differentiating between those psychologically generated symptoms which are produced unconsciously, often as a result of anxiety or depression, and those that constitute deliberate deception. Such malingering has the unstated intent of accessing a secondary gain, such as welfare benefit. The art of diagnosis includes estimation of whether symptoms resonate with known pathophysiological processes, using history-taking as a story which unfolds logically towards a diagnosis, assessing how a patient reacts to their symptoms compared to neutral matters, detecting exaggeration or falsification, and documenting evidence of psychologically generated abnormalities during examination. Scientific ability is only one of the attributes of a good diagnostician; equally important are abilities to notice things, to weigh up human nature and to recognise dilemmas.

There are also occasions when medical conditions cause mental health problems directly.

      "title": "Exertional Rhabdomyolysis",
      "abstract": "Introduction Rhabdomyolysis is defined as the breakdown of muscle fibers that results in the release of muscle proteins and other cellular constituents into the circulation. Exercise, particularly when strenuous and unaccustomed, causes damage and subsequent muscle fiber breakdown, known as exertional rhabdomyolysis [1]. Evidence of muscle damage is derived from microscopic analysis of muscle biopsy samples taken from subjects who have undergone strenuous exercise [1]. Muscle fibers from these subjects show focal disruption in the banding patterns; particularly evident is Z-line streaming [2]. Determination of muscle damage is often made from analysis of blood samples; the most common measure of muscle damage is creatine kinase (CK), although many other muscle constituents have been assessed in blood samples, such as myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin I, and myosin heavy chain [3]. Symptoms of exertional muscle damage are muscle soreness, pain, swelling, and stiffness. Pain generally develops in the hours after exercise and peaks between 24 and 48 hours postexercise [1]. The muscle has a tremendous capacity to repair itself, and it is suggested that the damage/repair process may be the stimulus for muscle growth and adaptation to exercise [4]. Pain is generally tolerable and temporary, and therefore of little clinical concern. However, rhabdomyolysis becomes clinically relevant when pain becomes debilitating, a compartment syndrome ensues, or elevated levels of circulating myoglobin precipitate in the kidney tubules. These precipitates can obstruct the renal tubules, lead to tubular necrosis, and effectively shut down the kidneys [5–7]. The increase in blood concentration of myoglobin after strenuous exercise is significantly correlated with the increase in CK activity [8]. Because of the relationship of CK and myoglobin, and the fact that measuring CK is less expensive and produces test results faster than myoglobin, elevated CK levels have been used as a surrogate for myoglobin and taken to indicate a risk of acute renal failure. In fact, recent attention has been drawn to monitoring CK in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) to assess the risk of myopathy and renal failure [9]. However, there appears to be little consensus concerning the amount of CK in the blood that would indicate a risk [9]. In cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, there is no commonly accepted CK threshold for determining when to hospitalize and treat individuals who present with elevated CK [8]. Terpilowski and Criddle [10] published an algorithm in which a CK greater than 20,000 U/L was the threshold to begin treatment to prevent renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. In the acute clinical setting, this arbitrary CK threshold of 20,000 U/L seems reasonable and prudent. Granted, CK values of up to 20,000 U/L are common and can seem benign in exertional rhabdomyolysis. For example, a study of serial CK values in 12 football players participating in two-a-day practices showed that, by day 4 their mean CK level was just over 5000 U/L, with one player at nearly 19,000 U/L, yet no player had any problems [11]. Also, as cited below and often discussed anecdotally among sports medicine physicians, cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis exist in patients with initial CK values well over 20,000 U/L, yet who recover simply with oral hydration. This may be why most experts who advise on management of exertional rhabdomyolysis do not cite a CK threshold for hospital admission [12–14]. What is key is not the CK level per se, but the setting, degree, stage, and tempo of the exertional rhabdomyolysis. Comorbidities such as heat stress, dehydration, shock, acidosis, and pre-existing illness can accelerate and compound the clinical problems. Life-threatening hyperkalemia can develop quickly, compartment syndromes can ensue, and initially it is difficult to predict whether, or how fast, renal failure may develop. Oral hydration and outpatient observation may suffice for a stable patient with CK of 20,000 to 50,000 U/L (and possibly higher), normal creatinine, and good urine flow. But in light of the clinical uncertainties cited above, it seems reasonable to argue that most patients who present to the emergency room with evidence of acute exertional rhabdomyolysis and a CK threshold of 20,000 U/L should be treated with vigorous intravenous hydration and close monitoring in the hospital for at least a day or two. CK Increase After Exercise Most strenuous exercise results in an increase in blood CK activity because of the stress placed on the contracting muscle fibers. Peaks of up to 80,000 U/L have been reported after exercise with no clinical consequence [8]. However, endurance exercises, even as prolonged and strenuous as marathon running, result in only relatively small increases in CK for the amount of muscle mass involved in the exercise. For example, Smith et al. [15] reported that CK activity in 34 runners immediately after the London Marathon was 707.8 U/L. Similar values were reported in a group of 16 runners immediately after a marathon with a peak increase of 2477 U/L at 24 hours postexercise, returning to near baseline by 96 hours postexercise [16]. Cycling for 2 hours resulted in an increase in CK of 542 U/L at 24 hours after the exercise [17]. Downhill running is often used as a laboratory model to produce muscle soreness and damage because the eccentric (muscle lengthening) contractions are exaggerated in this form of activity as the muscles produce a braking action to counterbalance the downhill forces. Although eccentric actions are known to produce muscle damage, the increase in CK activity after downhill running is relatively small because the contractions are not forceful. For example, Peake et al. [18] reported a CK increase of 1000 U/L 24 hours after a 45-minute bout of downhill running at 60% VO2max, and Pizza et al. [19] reported peak CK values of about 850 U/L 12 hours after 60 minutes of downhill running at 70% VO2max. From these studies and others [3,20,21], CK peaks about 24 hours after endurance-type exercise with peaks generally less than 5000 U/L. High-force eccentric contractions produce a large strain on muscle fibers resulting in considerably greater damage compared with endurance-type activities [1]. Over the past 20 years, our laboratory has used strenuous one-arm exercise to examine elevated CK levels produced by muscle injury [7,22–27]. Most of these studies used small sample sizes, but we and others have occasionally observed that some subjects are “high-responders” to this standard exercise, with postexercise blood CK values as high as 80,000 U/L [8,26]. We recently examined blood CK activity in 208 subjects who performed 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles. The average CK increase was about 7500 U/L, peaking at 4 days postexercise and returning to near baseline by 10 days postexercise. In a study from another laboratory [28], nine subjects performed 100 maximal eccentric contractions of the knee extensors; the peak CK activity at 4 days postexercise was 18,129 U/L, and at 11 days postexercise CK remained elevated at 1009 U/L, then returned to baseline by 14 days. High-force eccentric contractions of isolated muscle groups show a larger (often > 5000 U/L) and more delayed peak (4–5 days postexercise) in circulating CK activity compared with endurance type exercises. Relationship of CK and Renal Function Although we and others have reported cases in which CK is profoundly elevated after controlled exercise in laboratory experiments, we have never provoked renal failure, nor has renal failure been reported in the numerous laboratory studies of exercise-induced muscle damage. However, these studies have typically not monitored renal function to determine possible renal compromise. Clinical definitions of acute renal failure are commonly based on changes in creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine output. In a recent report [8], we presented data on measures of renal function (potassium, osmolality, BUN, creatinine, phosphorus, and uric acid) in the 208 subjects who performed strenuous one-arm eccentric exercise. Despite CK levels for 11 subjects between 15,000 and 20,000 U/L, 16 subjects between 21,000 and 30,000 U/L, and eight subjects between 31,000 and 80,000 U/L, there was no impairment in renal function. Hurley [29] described a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented at an office visit with a 2-day history of dark urine and painful, swollen arms produced from a 2-hour weight lifting regimen performed 3 days prior. His CK was 181,690 U/L, myoglobinuria was positive, and creatinine was normal. He was not hospitalized and recovered with supportive therapy of rest, fluids, and analgesics. We [30] described the case of a 37-year-old emergency room physician who performed excessive exercise in a health club under direction of a personal trainer. The day after the exercise session, he noted severe arm pain, and on the following day, dark urine. His blood CK levels over a 3-day period were 19,746, 70,158, and 45,461 U/L. He was not hospitalized and recovered with self-treatment of oral hydration and bicarbonate. There have been many reports of rhabdomyolysis induced by recreational exercise [30–45], but fewer incidents of concomitant acute renal failure when there is no other underlying problem (eg, drug or alcohol abuse, or underlying genetic predisposition such as sickle cell trait or carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency) [45–48]. Demos et al. [38] reported data on 11 Marine Corps recruits who were hospitalized with muscle pain and swelling of the shoulders and arms on the third day of basic training that included push-ups, pull-ups, rope climbs and other upper body exercises. Eight of the 11 men noted dark urine and dipstick analysis indicated the presence of heme pigment for all patients. Serum BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, and total and direct bilirubin levels were normal. The men were hospitalized, treated with fluid infusion, and had an uneventful recovery. The CKs on the day after admission ranged from 26,708 U/L to 109,609 U/L. Sinert et al. [49] reported 35 cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis in young healthy male prisoners who had performed exercise, specifically repetitive squat jumps, chin-ups, or lifting weights, as a consequence of losing a game of dominoes. The prisoners presented to the hospital an average of 2.7 days after the exercise exertion with symptoms of thigh or arm pain and a change in urine color. The range in CK was 700 U/L to 165,000 U/L. None presented with hyperkalemia, acidosis, or elevated creatinine or BUN, and other blood tests were normal. All patients tested positive for blood in the urine without microscopic hematuria. Although some of these men presented with alarmingly high CK levels, by the time they presented to the hospital, they were likely already on the way to healing. However, patients were hospitalized and all but one treated with intravenous forced bicarbonate diuresis. No patient developed renal failure. In most of the cases, treatment did not occur until at least 48 hours after the exercise, which is common in cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, in which patients do not present to the emergency room until 48 hours after the event when the urine is either noticeably dark and/or the pain is severe. Generally heat stress, dehydration, exercise-induced aciduria (which decreases myoglobin's solubility), or trauma are factors when exertional rhabdomyolysis (high CK) results in acute renal failure in otherwise healthy people [49]. Seedat et al. [46] examined hospital records over an 18-year time frame (1969–1986) and noted that 19 runners who participated in the Comrades Marathon in South Africa were admitted to the renal unit for treatment of acute renal failure, where dehydration and hypotension were present. Another case report [48] described a 25-year-old woman who hiked down the Grand Canyon in an ambient temperature of 100°F for 4 hours and suddenly collapsed. Four hours later she was transported to the hospital, where her laboratory test results indicated a serum creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL, BUN of 21 mg/dL, and an impressive CK of 1.6 million U/L. She was treated for heat stroke and acute renal failure. Even those with moderate increases in CK may develop acute renal failure. Hurley [29] described the case of a 17-year-old young man who presented with nausea and back pain 48 hours after participating in a high school football game and a session of bongo drum playing. Because of the back pain and possibility of trauma, an intravenous pyelogram was performed that showed poorly functioning kidneys with faint nephrogram. His CK on hospital admittance was 1723 U/L and increased the next day to 2423 U/L. Creatinine levels were 3.0 on admittance and 5.9, 9.0, and 2.5 mg/dL over the next several days. It was concluded that the myoglobinemia (from exercise) and radiographic contrast material led to acute renal failure. Baysal et al. [45] described a case of a 21-year-old man who participated in 1.5 hours of weight lifting exercise. He appeared to have no evidence of dehydration, heat stress, or other intervening factors, and presented 4 days later with painful, swollen arms and dark urine. CK was 101,080 U/L, BUN was 73 mg/dL, and creatinine was 8.4 mg/dL. A kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis with eosinophilic material in the tubules. The authors suggested that the swelling produced a type of compartment syndrome leading to continued muscle breakdown. Conclusions Recreational activity frequently produces large increases in circulating CK activity without consequence. Thus, high CK levels alone do not portend renal failure. Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis can, and probably do, resolve on their own without treatment. When taking a blood sample during a routine check, for example in monitoring patients on statin therapy, a high blood CK activity may indicate that strenuous exercise was performed in the previous 10 days. Patients should be queried as to their exercise history during this time. Snow shoveling, dirt shoveling, lifting and lowering heavy boxes, strenuous resistance training, and excessive calisthenics (such as push-ups and pull-ups) are exercises that may dramatically increase circulating CK activity for several days due to forceful eccentric contractions. In addition to elevated CK, factors such as underlying disease, dehydration, environmental heat stress, or genetic predisposition (eg, sickle cell trait) are likely required for exertional rhabdomyolysis to result in acute renal failure [8]. Persons who present to the emergency room with painful, swollen muscles about 2 days after a bout of strenuous exercise should be monitored for kidney function (BUN and creatinine), evidence of myoglobinuria and dehydration, and be queried regarding hydration, heat stress during the exercise, and possible trauma. In cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, especially in laboratory situations, CK levels up to 100,000 U/L in the absence of nephrotoxic factors have been found to resolve without consequence when no treatment is provided. However, because few data confirm this in a clinical situation in which there may be comorbidities, it remains conservative and prudent in the emergency room to hydrate intravenously and monitor closely to help avoid hyperkalemia and/or acute renal failure in the face of fulminant exertional rhabdomyolysis.",

      "title": "Chronic stress and chronic disease in life and work: Conceptual and methodological issues",
      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "title": "[Medically unexplained symptoms].",
      "abstract": "Patients with physical symptoms for which no medical explanation can be found are relatively common in general practice. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms are frequently frustrating to physicians both in primary and secondary care and utilize health sources disproportionately. They frequently attend both primary care units and hospitals and are usually not satisfied with the care they receive. Medically unexplained symptoms in patient populations are strongly associated with psychiatric pathology and with anxiety and depression in particular. They are also linked to personality pathology, childhood adversity, adult trauma or medically unexplained symptoms in childhood. The predictive value of alexithymia in determining these symptoms is controversial. Patients who have high negative affectivity or neuroticism tend to score high on measures of physical symptoms. These symptoms have a high degree of co-occurrence. The same person may meet the diagnostic criteria for several functional somatic syndromes simultaneously. The clinician should be aware of the cultural and social shaping of the bodily experience of these patients and hence acknowledge the somatic nature and reality of the symptoms. The clinician should make the person feel understood and establish a positive collaborative relationship. This would enable him/her to correct misconceptions about the disease and give a positive explanation of symptoms. Antidepressant therapy and cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy have been proved to be moderately effective in this group of patients. Because of the high disability that might be caused by these symptoms, psychiatrists and primary and secondary care physicians should pay careful attention to this clinical condition. These symptoms may also aid us in challenging the long-held idea of mind-body dualism which is inherent in Western biomedicine.",

However, pain is not always related to tissue damage and does not always serve a protective function. This is the case with neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory parts of the nervous system, and with some other chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and migraine.2 Acute and chronic pain may cause suffering and interfere with daily life, factors that influence the choice of treatment. Acute pain is the most common reason for visiting an emergency department,3 and surgical procedures are often associated with acute postoperative pain.4,5 Chronic pain also causes suffering, as reflected by the finding in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 that chronic low back pain was the leading cause of years lived with disability.6 In addition to the contribution of pain to disability, that study showed that the associated problem of opioid use disorders accounted for 5.8 million additional years lived with disability,6 an observation that underpins attempts to treat pain with drugs other than opioids. Long-term opioid administration has minimal effects on chronic pain and can cause tolerance, drowsiness, and dependence, as well as impaired memory, concentration, and judgment.7 For these reasons, the International Association for the Study of Pain recommends caution in prescribing opioids for chronic pain,8 and there has been an increased emphasis on the use of nonopioid pain management. The choice of treatment for pain depends on many factors, and the heterogeneity and large number of acute and chronic pain conditions preclude a general treatment algorithm. In cooperation with the World Health Organization, the International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a classification of chronic pain for the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases2 (Table 1), and a similar classification has been proposed for acute pain,5 providing the bases for facilitating treatment pathways.",

The heart attack forced a break in his employment and made his previously subclinical disability obvious to employer, wife, and the claimant himself. The resulting disability featured depression, anhedonia, and loss of identity, thus becoming primarily psychiatric in nature. No one of these disorders is “causally related” as a single entity; the problem is the outcome of a cumulative stress in a person made highly vulnerable through prior deterioration. Of particular import is the demonstration of “context-dependence”: workers depend for their own sense of identity and responsibility upon their occupation, and the loss of work becomes itself a “causal” factor.",

KNIGHT ALDRICH, MD* Pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) is, in a way, the ultimate psychosomatic condition in that the interrelationship among psychological and somatic causes and psychological and somatic symptoms is welldefined and relatively uncontroversial. Pseudocyesis has been recognized since the time of Hippocrates. Its incidence has been reported [1] as one case per 250 pregnancies. The signs and symptoms of amenorrhea, abdominal and uterine enlargement, changes in breasts and cervix, fetal movements, and nausea, vomiting, and weight gain have led physicians through the centuries to misdiagnose pregnancy as often as once in three cases, even in recent years [1, 2]. Symptoms are often related with such complete conviction by the patient that the physician or obstetrician is led to omit examinations or tests he might otherwise perform. Earlier psychodynamic formulations considered pseudocyesis to be a manifestation of a hysterical conversion. Later formulations viewed the condition as an organ neurosis. A more recent view [3] implicates depression as a major determinant. Childhood deprivation, the need to avoid abandonment or loss of love object, and the fear of losing the capacity to bear a child (most cases occur in childless women of an average age of thirty-three) have been implicated as potential contributors to causation. Psychophysiological correlates have also been explored. Fried et al. report that \"the psychic factor ... is capable of affecting the pituitary, probably by way of the hypothalamus, causing the release of lactogenic hormones, the suppression of follicle stimulating hormone and consequent persistence of lutein function with the production of estrogen and progesterone\" [pp. 1332-1333].

The anterior pituitary reacts by decreasing follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and by increasing prolactin secretion. The decrease of FSH and LH prevents ovulation and results in amenorrhea. The increased prolactin promotes lactation (and may support the persistence of the corpus luteum if prolactin is luteotropic). [P. 227] Most of the patients discussed at length in previous reports have had a single episode of pseudocyesis. Case histories of recurrent pseudocyesis have not, to my knowledge, been reported in detail, although there are brief accounts of up to four occurrences in one subject [4]. The following history describes a patient who suffered two episodes in a span of approximately four years. Case History The patient's parents were married near the turn of the century. It was a marriage of convenience, arranged because both fathers thought that it would consolidate a merger of their extensive international interests. At the time of her marriage, Mrs. T. was twentyfour , a plain, stout, highly religious woman with neither interest nor competence in the hectic social life which already appealed to her eighteen-year-old husband, and which was to appeal to him even more over the years. The couple had little in common: she had been born and educated in Europe and never felt as comfortable speaking English as she did speaking her native tongue. He was intelligent and attractive, and grew up to be competent and successful in business as well as in society . Both were fond of children, but they were disappointed when five successive pregnancies led to miscarriages or stillborn infants. By the time a living daughter, Mary, was born, on 2/18/16, even their shared affection for the child was not enough to bring them together. Mr. T., much warmer in temperament than his wife, was obviously delighted with his daughter. He indulged her, lavished affection on her, and loved to show her off to company. Her more restrained mother, on the other hand, showed little outward affection toward...",

Immobility, unconscious, or unable to sense pain are the main reasons and has an effect on individual functions restricted to bed. It can lead to constant pressure. Pressure sores, an injury to the skin and underlying tissues occur as a result of direct unrelieved pressure of soft tissue against bones. It happens on areas of the skin that are under pressure from lying in bed, sitting in a wheelchair or wearing a cast for a prolonged time. A bedsore can become deep. It can extend into the muscle and bone. Once a bedsore develops, it is often very slow to heal. Depending on the severity of the bedsore, the person's physical condition, and the presence of other diseases (such as diabetes), bedsores can take days, months, or even years to heal. They may need surgery to help the healing process. Hence students play an important role in preventing pressure sores during clinical posting.Results: The results of major findings indicated that, in pretest Basic BSc nursing students had inadequate knowledge in various aspects of pressure sore and its prevention. Educational intervention was found to be a very effective method of providing information regarding pressure sore and its prevention. The mean post-test level of knowledge is significantly higher than the mean pre test knowledge scores “t”=P",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "title": "Maladaptive daydreaming should be included as a dissociative disorder in psychiatric manuals: position paper",
      "abstract": "Maladaptive daydreaming is a distinct syndrome in which the main symptom is excessive vivid fantasising that causes clinically significant distress and functional impairment in academic, vocational and social domains. Unlike normal daydreaming, maladaptive daydreaming is persistent, compulsive and detrimental to one’s life. It involves detachment from reality in favour of intense emotional engagement with alternative realities and often includes specific features such as psychomotor stereotypies (e.g. pacing in circles, jumping or shaking one’s hands), mouthing dialogues, facial gestures or enacting fantasy events. Comorbidity is common, but existing disorders do not account for the phenomenology of the symptoms. Whereas non-specific therapy is ineffective, targeted treatment seems promising. Thus, we propose that maladaptive daydreaming be considered a formal syndrome in psychiatric taxonomies, positioned within the dissociative disorders category. Maladaptive daydreaming satisfactorily meets criteria for conceptualisation as a psychiatric syndrome, including reliable discrimination from other disorders and solid interrater agreement. It involves significant dissociative aspects, such as disconnection from perception, behaviour and sense of self, and has some commonalities with but is not subsumed under existing dissociative disorders. Formal recognition of maladaptive daydreaming as a dissociative disorder will encourage awareness of a growing problem and spur theoretical, research and clinical developments.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the paper is to discuss issues related to cases of death during autoerotic activities (defined in international literature as autoerotic death) on the basis of criminalistic, legal, forensic-medical and psychological knowledge. These are events in which death usually occurs as a result of rapid suffocation (autoerotic asphyxia, sexual asphyxia) due to the blocking of respiratory openings, hanging or strangulation, in the course of activities undertaken in order to evoke defined experiences of a sexual nature. A fatal consequence should be investigated rather as an unfortunate accident than the conscious intention of the victim/ perpetrator of the incident. As in the case of suicide, the victim is at the same time the perpetrator of the action, although other people may also have participated in the behaviour or provoked it. Some cases of this type must surely number among the dark figure of crimes. The case selected and described in this paper was studied at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow. It constituted both an example and a starting point for broader analysis of the issue with reference to various fields of science. Incidents consisting in self-strangulation with the aim of achieving sexual satisfaction have been noted by sexologists, and in situations ending in death, such cases are analysed by law enforcement agencies with the participation of forensic medical doctors. Cases of death as a result of autoerotic activities thus requires a complex, interdisciplinary approach in order to explain them.",

      "title": "Insomnia heterogeneity: Characteristics to consider for data-driven multivariate subtyping",
      "abstract": "Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have reported surprisingly few consistent insomnia-characteristics with respect to cognitions, mood, traits, history of life events and family history. One interpretation of this limited consistency is that different subtypes of insomnia exist, each with its own specific multivariate profile of characteristics. Because previously unrecognized subtypes will be differentially represented in individual studies and dilute effect sizes of subtype-dependent characteristics of importance, they are unlikely to be reported consistently in individual studies, let alone in meta-analyses. This review therefore aims to complement meta-analyses by listing previously reported psychometric characteristics of insomnia, irrespective of the degree of consistency over studies. The review clearly indicates that characteristics of insomnia may not be limited to sleep. Reports suggest that at least some individuals with insomnia may deviate from people without sleep complaints with respect to demographics, mental and physical health, childhood trauma, life events, fatigue, sleepiness, hyperarousal, hyperactivity, other sleep disorders, lifetime sleep history, chronotype, depression, anxiety, mood, quality of life, personality, happiness, worry, rumination, self-consciousness, sensitivity, dysfunctional beliefs, self-conscious emotion regulation, coping, nocturnal mentation, wake resting-state mentation, physical activity, food intake, temperature perception and hedonic evaluation. The value of this list of characteristics is that 1) internet has now made it feasible to asses them all in a large sample of people suffering from insomnia, and 2) statistical methods like latent class analysis and community detection can utilize them for a truly bottom-up data-driven search for subtypes. The supplement to this review provides a blueprint of this multivariate approach as implemented in the Sleep registry platform (www.sleepregistry.nl), that allows for bottom-up subtyping and fosters cross-cultural comparison and worldwide collaboration on insomnia subtype finding - and beyond.",

      "title": "The complex conundrum of geriatric depression and dementias",
      "abstract": "Late-life depression (LLD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia are clinically distinct yet interrelated disease constructs, wherein LLD can be a prodrome, risk factor, comorbidity, or consequence of MCI and dementia. There is considerable prevalence of depression in those with MCI or dementia, and vice versa, with maximum evidence in Alzheimer's disease. These intersections often form one of the most confusing aspects of psychogeriatric practice, leading to under-detection and mismanagement of depression, thus leading to incomplete recovery in most cases. This article focuses on this clinical ambiguity in daily practice, reviews the clinico-investigative pointers for the LLD–dementia intersection, and puts forward clinical and research recommendations in view of the available evidence. Although there is conflicting evidence regarding the cause–effect relationship between LLD, MCI, and dementia, it is likely that these constructs share some common pathological processes and are often associated with each other within a longitudinal clinical continuum. This is a linear yet complex bidirectional association: either the comorbid depression exaggerates preexisting cognitive deficits or chronic persistent depression eventually leads to major neurocognitive disorders, not to mention depression as a part of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which often impairs quality of life and psychosocial morbidity. Thus, a comprehensive approach, including tailored history, neuropsychiatric examination, and relevant investigations, is necessary for assessing the differentials, with a sound clinical understanding being vital to the process. Depression, if suspected, must be treated adequately with longitudinal neuropsychological reviews. Future research warrants elucidating precision biomarkers unique to these clinicopathological entities.",

Pain is entirely subjective, but we know it exists when we see the distressed patient.

      "abstract": "Depression is a pervasive and prevalent mental health disorder among prisoners, yet it frequently remains undiagnosed due to the phenomenon of diagnostic overshadowing - a clinical bias where prominent conditions or contexts obscure less obvious mental health issues. This review explores diagnostic overshadowing as a key barrier to identifying depression in people in custody, focusing on diagnostic failures, their consequences, and solutions. We review global literature on depression prevalence, which affects prisoners at significantly higher rates than the general population, yet it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes unrecognized due to overshadowing by the more prominent features of substance use, challenging behaviours or the prison context itself. Failure to recognize readily treatable depressive disorders because of diagnostic overshadowing results in serious but avoidable consequences, including elevated suicide rates, increased recidivism, and other adverse outcomes such as substance abuse and institutional violence, which collectively and individually perpetuate the cycle of personal distress and dysfunction, as well as the human and associated costs to others in society. By describing and highlighting diagnostic overshadowing as a particular problem in correctional settings, and by exploring its mechanisms in correctional psychiatry settings, we advocate for solutions for more reliable recognition of depression in prisoners, which is an essential first step to effectively address this readily treatable but easily overlooked serious mental disorder.",

In the UK, approximately 250 000 people suffer from schizophrenia or a schizophrenia-like illness.2\n\nA quarter of those who have experienced an episode of schizophrenia recover and the illness does not recur. Another 25% experience an unremitting illness. The remaining 50% have a recurrent illness, but with long episodes of considerable recovery from positive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and catatonic movements.3 Many with recurrent illness have enduring problems from schizophrenia such as persistent psychotic symptoms, but, for most people, the problems consist of negative symptoms such as loss of enthusiasm and emotional responsiveness, apathy, and social withdrawal.3 These negative symptoms, though intrinsic to schizophrenia, are compounded by the adverse effects of drugs, living in impoverished circumstances, and by the social stigma associated with mental illness. Recovery from episodes of schizophrenia for some people is often complicated by episodes of depression, substance abuse, and anxiety. People with schizophrenia have a shortened life expectancy4 due to physical illness, accidents, and other causes of violent death, especially suicide.5\n\nTreatments for schizophrenia are divided into the so-called “physical interventions” of drugs, psychological and social managements and, rarely in the UK, electroconvulsant treatment. This article draws upon evidence from systematic reviews undertaken by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, and summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of the main drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia. More detailed information is available on each treatment within the referenced reviews. These reviews are regularly updated in the Cochrane Library .6\n\nThe main class of drugs used to treat or manage schizophrenia is antipsychotics …",

Finally, by assessing the domains of illness behaviors such as disease conviction, beliefs in organic versus psychological causes, and denial, the clinician can document and then confront abnormal cognitive schema that revolve around somatic concerns that are a proxy for psychosocial difficulties.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

      "abstract": "A survey of the biochemical work in this field reveals a confusion of results. The lack of agreement among investigators may result from any one or more of a variety of uncontrolled factors. Differences in psychiatric diagnosis, poor research technique, including inadequate sampling and the lack of adequate normal control groups, lack of refinement in the biochemical techniques as well as lack of precision in the biochemical technicians, inadequate standards to indicate where the normal leaves off and the pathological begins, and insufficient or inept statistical treatment of the obtained data have all been more or less influential in presenting distorted and unreliable biochemical pictures of the mental disorders. These factors are in some measure within the control of the experimenter. Another factor over which the experimenter has no control and which is not a negligible one in explaining the variety and abundance of conflicting results is the variability of the psychoneurotic. The variability is uncontrolled and may yield high normal results oné day and low normal results the next in the same individual. A vegetative and vasomotor instability is probably a more or less constant symptom of neurotic behavior. The variability of the results of chemical studies of the blood appears to reflect the instability of the intermediary metabolism of the psychoneurotic. Hence the degree or kind of emotional stability may be a function of the amount of variability in the blood constituents. In the final analysis the variability of the psychoneurotic probably implies fatigue and over or under correction or loss of adaptability, which ultimately results in irritability, dysfunction and irreversibility of certain organic mechanisms.",

Although depression itself, apart from medication, is generally believed to be associated with sexual dysfunction, the few existing studies report wide discrepancies with regard to frequency, gender, and quality of sexual dysfunction. Loss of libido is frequently and consistently associated with major depression. Moreover, sexual dysfunction secondary to depression or other factors is often mistaken for that caused by antidepressant medication. Although antidepressants have long been associated with sexual dysfunction, the precise nature and magnitude of sexual side effects have not been fully appreciated. This article will review the literature on sexual dysfunction associated with unmedicated depression and offer a guide for the clinician evaluating and treating depressed patients with sexual problems.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes.

Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico.

A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III-R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM-IV.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa.

These are different sample format describe various symptoms and prevention associate with those symptoms. Genetic activity, genes presence and repetition also gives user activity detail and problems in human body. Mental illness is a type of disease which relate with the mental disorder. It deals in human interaction, its behavior, and its regular and irregular activity. In this stage human sudden start misbehave or extra activities during the particular phase and hence an un-predictable incident may occur. Psychometric disease cases are increasing day by day with different symptoms in human being. These are diseases which occur due to over work pressure, mental activity, some past human life incident or may be the victim of some good or bad incident. It leads to several problems in society, as per well issue with the person who is suffering with the particular disorder. An human interaction and understanding capacity is different than a normal person which keep person separate from the normal society and social life. These disorders also occur sometime very violent and make it very tedious to recover. Psychiatric relate to brain disorder, Mental disorder, irregular work performing in public etc. Diagnosis over the disease is complex and not fixed. In the previous research on the same concern shows that the past data can be analyzed properly and it can further be useful for the precautions. Mental disorder records may leads to several Meta data, report activities observed by hospital or supervision person. A classification over the given symptoms, its action and medical treatment help in diagnosis. Past studies always parts in important role using which further decision can be taken. Mental disorder, mental health, further possibilities can be observed and driven remedy can be discussed.

      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are recognized as major public health problems with substantial personal, economic and social burden on those afflicted and their families. Despite this the development of quality of life research has been rather slow in the field but it is evident both from epidemiological and clinical studies that persons with major depression have a substantially lower subjective quality of life than healthy subjects, and that quality of life is severely affected in a number of life domains as well as associated with a worse functioning in various external life conditions. Subjective quality of life has also mostly been found to be worse than in other psychiatric conditions and equal to or worse than quality of life in several major medical chronic illnesses. Although investigations of quality of life in anxiety disorder are growing they are less frequent than in depression and still in its infancy. This is most evident concerning post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and further studies in all anxiety disorders are strongly needed. The general picture emerging from studies performed is that anxiety disorders are illnesses that impair quality of life and social functioning in a number of life domains. There is some evidence that quality of life is most compromised in panic disorder (PD) and PTSD.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "title": "Stigma and Suicide.",
      "abstract": "Suicide is one of the major mental health problems in the world. It is estimated that one million suicide are committed per year and that after every suicide six people from the surrounding suffer or develop major life changes. After suicide survivors are at higher risk of developing major psychological changes and suicidal ideations as well. They go through the complicated process of grief which is specifically characterized by the felling of guilt, shame, denial and anger. The griefing process, more often than in other causes of death, doesn't integrate but is complicated with prolonged grief. This represents a very favorable state for perceiving stigma. Stigma is most often defined as a mark of disgrace or infamy; a stain or reproach, as on one's reputation. In suicide we talk about public and self stigma. Both forms of stigma can separately cause social isolation, demoralization, the felling of hopelessness and other consequences that interfere with the previous functioning. Because of the high incidence of psychological changes after stigma it is crucial for the bereaved to have close mental health services. But stigma is a barrier to treatment seeking. After suicide most survivors fell stigmatized but it is not yet known which factors modify the perception of stigma. Other causes of death like natural death are less related to stigma. On the other side traumatic death like an accident or homicide seem to be related to perception of stigma in the same way survivors perceive after suicide. Suicide and stigma are related in a two way direction meaning that suicide can cause stigma but stigma can lead to suicidal thoughts as well. Even suicide attempters fell stigmatized by colleagues, medical staff and their closest surrounding. There is a need for interventions. The effect of broad anti-stigma campaigns and targeted programs still have to be examines. In clinical settings, interventions that reduce self stigma, stigma-stress and shame might successfully reduce suicidality.",

It was discovered that patients with endogenous depression considered themselves to be ill, but only in relation to depression. They usually do not perceive in themselves any psychotic illness. It was noticed that in depression past achievements appeared to be foreign to the patients. This was described in among other terms as \"emotionally empty judgments\". Analyzing the clinical picture of hypomanic states, stress was placed on the notion of the coexistence of logical thinking (and in some cases these thinking patterns are concerned with a feeling of heightened cognitive ability) with thinking styles based on logical errors. In all patients hypermnesia appears more important than other factors. The above mentioned phenomena are the subject of further research.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

It has a protective role because it protects the body from damage and helps to maintain organ function, the organism as a whole. Pain is one of the world's health problems, the most common causes of pain are injury, surgery, malignancy, and hormonal disorders. Delineation of pain is to: physical, mental and physical psychogenic caused. Physical pain is a symptom for which patients most often asked for medical help, the pain is a warning mechanism to inform that there is a tissue injury or dysfunction of individual organs. Mental pain and suffering often called. It is a state of deep sadness often associated with fear, anxiety and other negative emotions that occur after someone, for the individual, irreparable and significant loss. The relationship between pain and injury is not simple, that is possible: injury without pain, without injury, pain disproportionate to the severity of injury, pain after healing of injuries. Injuries without pain - some people are born without sensitivity to pain. This very rare genetic disorder is known as analgesia. Pain without injury - common in so-called. psychogenic pain where the pain occurs after mental tension and where there are no organic damage. Pain disproportionate the difficulty of injury- may occur in insignificant physical processes that do not have great physical significance for the total health of the individual, and cause very severe pain. The pain after healing injury - very common after injuring nerves and known examples of such pain are phantom pain and causalgia. Causalgia is very severe pain, burning type that occurs because of injury of damage causing their peripheral sensory nerves. Phantom pain is common in people who are missing the lower part of the body (leg, hand, and breast). Patients feel pain in a body part that they amputated therefore no longer exists, and so clearly perceived the pain that they feel that the body is still there. In addition to causing health, physical and mental difficulties, pain significantly affects the economic situation of the individual and society at large, so big attention should be paid to its prevention and cure. The doctor's obligation is to disclose the cause of pain and mitigate / eliminate pain. Access to treatment of chronic pain, sometimes acute, is multidisciplinary and should be administered pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (physical therapy, TENS, ultrasound, laser, exercise, heat and cold), and sometimes pain treatment methods (acupuncture, chiropractic and other) . While there has been great progress in the treatment of chronic pain, many patients are still suffering because of poor pain assessment and treatment.",

Obsessions are intrusive and unwanted thoughts, images or feelings which elicit considerable anxiety and discomfort. Commonly recurring themes in obsessions are aggression, blasphemy, death and (unacceptable) sexual urges. Compulsions are repetitive, ritualistic behaviours or mental acts that are performed to reduce or neutralise the anxiety that is elicited by the obsessions.The most frequently encountered compulsions are ordering, counting, checking and washing. When the patient resists carrying out the compulsions, anxiety usually increases. Patients generally recognize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and irrational. Nevertheless, the obsessions and com-pulsions cause marked distress, are timeconsuming and interfere signiicantly with the person’s social or occupational life. Many patients experience both obsessions and compulsions; only a minority presents with either obsessions or compulsions (Foa & Kozak). Ocd is classiied in dsm-4 as an anxiety disorder, although not all clinicians agree on this categorization (Nelson & Chouinard).",

Due to the specific features of the anatomy of cerebral circulation, hypertensive microangiopathy leads primarily to damage to the subcortical basal ganglia and deep white matter. Clinically, this is manifested by a concurrence of predominantly subcortical cognitive impairment and emotional and behavioral disorders as depression, emotional lability, and apathy. Some features of depression, such as the prevalence of anhedonia and fatigue and the significant severity of cognitive and somatic symptoms in an elderly person with vascular disease, suggest its organic nature (vascular depression).",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

It can occur in any workplace environment, but, in the past several years, its prevalence in the healthcare industry has gained more attention. Burnout has been defined as consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Up to 40% of physicians have reported burnout. Risk factors that contribute to physician burnout include female gender, young age, long working hours, low job satisfaction, and presence of a work–home conflict. Physical activity, mindfulness, and institutional wellness programs that include cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management may reduce the prevalence of burnout in healthcare workers.",

      "title": "Loneliness, the Human Condition, and Psychotherapy",
      "abstract": "Loneliness is experienced by nearly everyone, although its frequently and intensity vary widely. Existential loneliness may derive from the universal experience of separation from the mother in leaving the womb; it is an intrinsic and organic reality of each life. The other kind of loneliness comes from self-rejection and self-alienation from society and appears to be related to depression. The latter may lead to aberrant or self-destructive behavior such as drug abuse, but rarely to aggressive or anti-social behavior. There is some evidence that the ability to deal with loneliness is related to the experience of having been alone as a child in the presence of one parent, usually the mother. Without this experience, the capacity to confront loneliness is arrested; with it, a supportive environment is built into the personality. For the psychotherapist, each aspect of loneliness offers a special challenge. This paper considers some of the ways that therapists may help their patients cope with their loneliness.",

      "abstract": "Liaison psychiatrists are frequently asked to see people with chronic, debilitating and unexplained physical symptoms, in particular chronic pain and chronic fatigue. People with these conditions have often seen many doctors and received multiple medical investigations, but rarely have had any effective treatment or even explanation for their symptoms. There are many reasons for focusing on occupational factors in this patient group. First, many people may attribute their symptoms to workplace exposures. For example, back pain may commonly be put down to accidents; upper limb disorders to use of keyboards or repetitive manual tasks; and headaches and fatigue to visual display units or air conditioning. These attributions have prognostic and legal implications, and are likely to affect the course of treatment. Second, for those who have had prolonged sickness absence, it is often necessary to make decisions regarding return to work or to help them negotiate the often lengthy and complex medical retirement process. This may be a major stumbling block in managing such people. Finally, psychiatrists are frequently invited to write medico-legal reports regarding the role of occupational factors in causing unexplained physical symptoms. This article aims to address these issues and provide some practical guidance to clinicians.",

      "title": "Vaginal foreign body insertion in a patient with emotionally unstable personality disorder",
      "abstract": "Insertion of foreign objects into one or more bodily orifice, otherwise known as polyembolokoilamania, occurs as a result of a variety of psychosocial and psychiatric states. Such behaviour exposes the affected individual to the complications of object insertion, surgical removal and its adverse sequelae such as a colovesical fistula. Foreign body insertion into the vagina mainly involves children and can be associated with premenarchal vaginal discharge or sexual abuse. The gynaecological literature describes cases involving adults and can be associated with drug smuggling or sexual gratification. Commonly retrieved foreign bodies from the vagina includes tampons, hair pins, buttons, seeds, toy parts, objects used in foreplay, forgotten pessaries, pen caps, toilet tissue and illicit drugs for trafficking. There is a relative dearth of cases reported in the psychiatric literature. Management of deliberate foreign body insertion [DFBI) in borderline personality disorder patients is challenging, often repetitive and the potential for further self-harm and complex emotional issues may elicit strong countertransference from medical staff. Although there are well-established guidelines for acute medical and surgical management of DFBI, none provide an overview of the management of repeat presentations or consider the role of secondary gain or provide reinforcement strategies for managing this complex patient cohort. The authors present the case of a 23-year-old woman with an emotionally unstable personality disorder presenting to the emergency department after inserting objects in her vagina. This paper will provide an overview of the presentation, investigations and management of individuals presenting after inserting foreign objects into the vagina. In the majority of cases, a carefully obtained history and physical examination will render the diagnosis, although imaging modalities may be required to locate the misplaced objects. Individuals may present with bleeding, blood stained or foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Prompt management can prevent morbidity and mortality resulting from complications.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Burnout is a psychological reaction to unmanaged chronic workplace stress that occurs across three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. High rates of burnout have been observed in a wide range of professions, including healthcare and teaching; burnout has also been observed in unpaid work such as caregiving and parenting. Burnout is associated with reduced work performance and poor self-image, in addition to adverse mental and physical health outcomes ranging from major depressive disorder to type 2 diabetes. Burnout may influence health outcomes primarily via changes in health behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, but some evidence suggests that burnout can impact health independently of health behaviors. While the physiological underpinnings of burnout remain poorly understood, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and changes in DNA methylation patterns may be involved. Various interventions to reduce or prevent burnout have been tested; while mindfulness- and exercise-based interventions appear promising, results have been inconsistent. Further prospective research using higher-quality designs is needed to improve the scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of burnout.",

In the present paper a description will be presented of characteristic overactive behaviour which appears, in the majority of cases, to be due to cortical damage, frequently involving the temporal lobe, and sustained either at the time of birth or in later childhood. The behaviour symptoms exhibited were remarkably constant throughout the series of twenty-five children studied. There was marked restlessness, distractibility and an inability to concentrate for more than a few seconds at a time. The affected children showed an apparent compulsive need to touch every object which they saw, and to suck or chew them. Outbursts of aggressive and irresponsible behaviour occurred frequently, and the patients seemed to be incapable of responding to reprimand or chastisement for longer than a few minutes. The majority suffered from epilepsy or showed other evidence suggesting the presence of cerebral damage on examination.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy may be associated with automatisms that are classed as ‘insane ‘as they are deemed to have originated within the mind. ‘Sane automatism’ is said to occur from external factors, such as physical trauma, while ‘insane automatism’ is said to be innate to the individual experiencing them. To claim automatism within the context of a criminal matter requires a detailed evaluation of the behavior demonstrated and a questioning of the volitional and purposeful nature of this behavior. It is insufficient to rely upon past behavior in association with these seizures to justify the defense of automatism within a specific event. Epilepsy is often considered to be associated with an increase in violence. Proper epidemiological research, both in long‐term, large population control studies and hospital‐based studies, has suggested that epilepsy, per se, is not associated with an increase in violence when compared to the population at large and controlled for other familial and environmental factors.",

      "abstract": "Potential effects of psychological aggression have been investigated in terms of mental health disorders/symptoms, physical manifestations, personality traits, increases in physical and psychological aggression, and relationship changes and cessation. Probably because of methodological difficulties inherent in assessing this complex phenomenon, even the most commonly assessed outcome variables have produced contradictory results, with the exception of leaving or desiring to leave the psychologically abusive relationship. Some of the significant findings require more corroboration due to the small number of studies addressing them. The relative role of physical abuse in relation to psychological abuse has yet to be disentangled. Mediator/moderator variables are likely extremely important for explaining why particular consequences do not consistently result from psychological aggression. Although the hypothesized consequences/outcomes seem appropriate for further study, the most significant contribution may lie in intensive investigation of long-term, enduring psychological abuse that produces major personality and affective shifts in the recipient.",

      "title": "Euthymic suffering and wisdom psychology",
      "abstract": "In Fava and Guidi's paper1, euthymia is defined by \"lack of mood disturbances that can be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics\" , \"positive affects\" and \"psychological well-being\" . So, good mood is euthymic. But, what about bad mood and suffering which can also not be subsumed under diagnostic rubrics? Life is no rose garden. All human beings experience illness, failure, conflicts with others, problems with children or spouse, financial troubles, or legal disputes. It would be a mental disturbance to feel happy under these circumstances. Is euthymia limited to positive affects or happy hours, or should it include all forms of \"normal\" mood? That not all hardship and negative feelings automatically qualify as disorder is confirmed by the ICD-10, which provides separate codes (Z codes) for negative life situations such as loss of work, social exclusion, or burnout. If people feel unhappy when burdened by negative life events, this is no mental disorder, but \"healthy suffering\" . It is of great importance not to medicalize such everyday problems2. In clinical practice, there are many people who contact medical experts because of healthy suffering. They need a professional evaluation together with some advice. We need diagnostic criteria for healthy bad mood. Such criteria include situational adequacy of the type and intensity of the emotional reaction, self-appraisal, controllability, compliance with individual and social norms, lack of specific psychopathological signs and symptoms3. Healthy persons with normal bad mood display consistency in their behavior and values, show environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, flexibility, and resilience to go on with daily duties4. So, healthy suffering and bad mood should be included in the concept of euthymia. How can interventions deal with such a broadened concept of euthymia? There are basically four different approaches to foster euthymia. The first one is to get rid of bad mood by improving well-being through the increase of pleasant activities and experiences5. \"Regeneration therapy\"6 engages people in positive and self-care exercises, from board games to cultural and social activities, relaxation and make oneself up. Positive effects of these interventions were shown in regard to depressed mood or distress intolerance and the ability to work. The bottom line is that, if you are under stress, you should do something positive for yourself or coddle yourself. The second approach also aims to counteract bad mood, this time by teaching how to generate positive emotions directly. \"Euthymia therapy\"7 teaches the art of enjoyment and experiencing of pleasures. \"Well-being therapy\"1 teaches people to focus on constituents of positive mood by self-observation, change of dysfunctional cognitions, and promotion of activities. Studies on these interventions showed positive effects in depressed or psychosomatic patients transdiagnostically. The bottom line is to improve the capacity of the individual to generate positive emotions. A different type of approach is represented by \"mindfulness and acceptance\" based therapies8. Their primary goal is not to get rid of negative emotions and cognitions, but instead to change the individuals' relationship to their emotional state, their experiences, and the living context. This is done by encouraging awareness and acceptance of unpleasant feelings through mindfulness practice and cognitive defusion. Commitment and behavior change processes are based on contact with the present moment. Bad mood is accepted and may still be present after treatment. This approach implicitly has a broader concept of euthymia, including bad and positive mood alike. The bottom line is to accept and arrange oneself with something that cannot be changed. Another approach, which goes in the same direction, is \"wisdom therapy\"9. Life span psychology describes wisdom as a psychological capacity, given to all persons, which is essential in coping with severe, irreversible or unsolvable problems, but also in dealing with daily dilemmas, such as the decision whether to stay at home with a sick child or to go to work. Similar to other psychological capacities, there are about a dozen sub-dimensions, such as recognition of reality (factual and procedural knowledge, contextualism, relativization of problems and aspirations), mastery of emotions (perception and acceptance of emotions, serenity), acceptance of personal limitations (self-relativization, self-distance), clarification and self-assurance of goals and values (value relativism, forgiveness and acceptance of the past, uncertainty tolerance, long-term perspective), and interactional competencies (change of perspective, empathy). \"Wisdom therapy\" provides strategies to translate these sub-dimensions into treatment. There is evidence that it works in patients with severe adjustment disorders9. The goal of the intervention is to learn how to deal with bad and good times alike. Euthymia can be defined as a state of wisdom, in which persons feel at ease with themselves and the world, their past, the present and the future, in good and bad times, and do not lose heart and courage in the face of adversities and hardship. The concept of euthymia should reflect the daily existence of human beings. Happiness is limited to very few moments in life. Demands, hardship, burdens fill the rest of time. Back pain, heavy work or driving a car in combusted streets do not produce happiness. But there is nevertheless euthymia. The problem of mental illness is that people are overburdened and impaired by daily hassles, while healthy persons have resilience and can deal with bad times. We should not create the misunderstanding that happiness is the goal to be pursued by our interventions. This can lead to disappointment. Instead, mastery of exceptional and daily burdens and demands, and how nevertheless to \"feel OK\" (not happy but euthymic), should be the aim.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

The exposure of large population groups, mostly having no mental health problems prior to the exposure, and the subsequent development, in a significant proportion of the population, of a variety of psychiatric symptoms and disorders represent both a challenge and an opportunity for psychiatrists. There is sufficient evidence from the variety of mass violence/conflict situations, that a significant proportion of the exposed population develop different mental disorders. There are vulnerable groups like women, children, widows, orphans, elderly, disabled, those exposed to severe pain and loss of body parts. There is also a consistent finding of the dose-response to the amount of trauma and the prevalence of mental disorders. There is growing recognition that there is need to consider a variety of syndromes, in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) like acute stress disorder (ASD), depression, complicated bereavement reactions, substance use disorders, poor physical health, fear, anxiety, physiological arousal, somatisation, anger control, functional disability and arrest or regression of childhood developmental progression.

      "abstract": "This article reviews the impact of unilateral spatial neglect on daily living (\"functional\") activities. Its disturbances on basic functional activities, such as feeding, grooming, and locomotion, are easily identifiable. Patients with neglect frequently lack insight into their disorder and do not initiate compensatory behaviors, which probably impedes recovery. Simple standard tests of neglect during visual exploration correlate with impaired recovery of functional skills acutely following brain injury. However, unilateral neglect resolves in most individuals, yet many patients remain chronically impaired during daily living activities. This suggests that some other disorder associated with neglect may contribute to the failure to regain functional independence. A candidate disorder is general (non-spatial) inattention. However, cognitive studies in stroke are biased toward assessing neglect and are usually insensitive to other disorders that may accompany stroke, such as general inattention and executive dysfunction. Therefore, the contribution of unilateral neglect toward functional status relative to diverse other cognitive disorders after stroke is unclear. Treatments for unilateral neglect have been largely unsuccessful or impractical, or they were not evaluated in controlled studies. Intensive practice of scanning appears to benefit, but this observation needs to be replicated in a controlled manner. A recently developed treatment that involves wearing prisms to shift the view ipsilaterally has been associated with transfer of training effects to untreated spatial activities and prolonged improvement of neglect. However, despite some promising lines of investigation in neglect rehabilitation, further research is required to understand where neglect stands in relation to other cognitive disturbances that follow stroke with respect to functional significance and recovery, to decide what disorders should be targeted for rehabilitation.",

These stressors interact with personality traits and with a genetic predisposition to depression, thereby bringing about mdd. Therefore, the neurobiology of depression cannot be separated from the neurobiology of stress system. A substantial number of publications have in fact demonstrated that mdd patients show abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, which is a key element of the stress response. Such disturbances are exacerbated by chronic stress, early experiences of abuse and even prenatal exposure to stress. On the other hand, genetic variations can play a role in the hpa axis dysfunction and in vulnerability to depression. Evidence is emerging that certain genes are directly involved in the functioning of the hpa axis. Other genetic factors, not directly related to the hpa axis, are probably relevant as well, the best known example being the serotonin transporter gene.",

Kleptomania has been classified as impulse control disorder in DSM 5. Research on kleptomania reveals that it appears to be a lack of resistance to desire for stealing, but the cause of kleptomania have not been fully eludicated. From a clinical point of view, it is often stated that spontaneous and sudden appearance of kleptomanic behavior has been observed, although a small part of the behaviour has already been planned. On the other hand it has been shown that it can also occur after an event which causes anger or stress factors. Kleptomanic behavioral attacks often occur in the community, in stores, in supermarkets, and in malls. Stolen objects are generally worthless objects from an economical point of view. Differential diagnosis of kleptomania should be made from theft, acute mania, alcohol-substance intoxication, antisocial personality disorder and obsessive - compulsive disorder. Selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors have been preferred in the treatment. On the other hand, the possible association of kleptomania with the addiction spectrum has prompted opioid antagonists as a treatment option. There are case reports and a controlled trial showing that opioid antagonists are effective in adults and adolescents with kleptomania. In this open-label study has been reported to naltrexon have been received for 12 weeks and efficience had been reported. In this case report, the evaluation of kleptomani as a behavioral dependency has been made after the development of kleptomanic behaviors in the early remission period of the patient diagnosed with alcohol dependency.",

Emotional problems due to the disease should be taken seriously and included in the treatment plan. A purely dermatological therapy may not achieve its purpose. Even mild to moderate disease can be associated with significant depression and suicidal ideation, and psychologic change does not necessarily correlate with disease severity. Acne patients suffer particularly under social limitations and reduced quality of life. Psychic comorbidities in acne are probably greater than generally assumed. Attention should be paid to psychosomatic aspects especially if there is suspicion of depressive-anxious disorders, particularly with evidence of suicidal tendencies, body dysmorphic disorders, or also of disrupted compliance. Therefore, patients who report particularly high emotional distress or dysmorphic tendencies due to the disease should be treated adequately, if possible, by interdisciplinary therapy. The dermatologist must have some knowledge of the basics of psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, which sometimes must be coupled with systemic and topical treatments of acne in conjunction with socalled psychosomatic basic treatment.",

      "abstract": "The essential feature of social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is a fear of scrutiny by other people in social or performance situations. The level of anxiety experienced by the person with social anxiety disorder is excessive, and results in substantial impairment in the sufferer's social, family, and professional life. Three distinct subtypes of the disorder have been identified: generalized social anxiety disorder, in which the individual fears a multitude of social situations; nongeneralized social anxiety disorder, in which only 2 or 3 situations are feared; and public-speaking phobia. Results from a number of studies suggest that these subtypes of social anxiety disorder may represent distinct clinical syndromes, with the generalized subtype producing the most severe disability. Despite the prevalence of social anxiety disorder and the disability it causes, this condition remains underdiagnosed, and thus undertreated, by clinicians. This review discusses the barriers that prevent people who have this disorder from seeking help, and the steps that clinicians can take to aid their recognition and treatment of the disorder. It is only by effective diagnosis and treatment that the burden of social anxiety disorder will be lifted, allowing patients to resume a normal life.",

      "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Psychiatric Profile, Depression andBody Dysmorphic Disorder in patients with Amputation and PostStroke.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nAmputation is defined as the removal of extremities of body part by trauma or by\r\nSurgical procedure. Amputees may feel empty, and mutilated. Amputation due to\r\nTrauma is a catastrophic injury and causes major disability in most of the cases\r\n(Wald 2004)1. Loss of limb is associated with low self-esteem, body image\r\nDisturbance, social isolation and also a sense of stigmatization (William et al.\r\n2004). In many conditions amputation is unavoidable. Irrespective of the aetiology,\r\nAmputation is considered as a mutilating surgery and it definitely affects the lives\r\nOf the patients (De Godoy et al. 2002). Limb amputation is a more commonly\r\nOccurring event in the present society.\r\nThe loss of a limb distorts the individual’s body image leading to the thought of\r\nNot being a complete human being. The loss of the functions performed with that\r\nLimb renders him helpless for sometime. The amputee not only loses physical\r\nFunctioning, he also loses hope and future aspirations, his plans and ambitions get\r\nShattered. Thus, he loses not only a limb but also a part of his world and future.\r\nMost of them remain anxious and worried about their interpersonal relationship in\r\nThe social, vocational, familial and marital milieu. Individuals having an overt\r\nMental breakdown will need active psychiatric intervention whereas careful\r\nPsychiatric interview is necessary for the ones whose mental symptoms are not so\r\nObvious.\r\nLimb loss is a major event that can severely impact the psychological health of the\r\nIndividual concerned. Studies show that 20-60% of the amputees attending follow\r\nUp clinics are assessed to be clinically depressed. Individuals with traumatic\r\nAmputation irrespective of the age are likely to suffer from body image problems,\r\nBut these findings are more common in younger individuals. The psychological\r\nReactions to amputation are clearly diverse ranging from severe disability at one\r\nExtreme; and a determination to effectively resume a full and active life at other\r\nEnd. In adults the age at which an individual receives the amputation is an\r\nImportant factor. Studies by Bradway JK et al (1984)2, Kohl SJ Et al (1984)3,\r\nLivneh H (1999)4, on the psycho-social adaptation to amputation has led to a\r\nPlethora of clinical and empirical findings. Kingdon D et al 1982 equated\r\nAmputation with loss of one’s perception of wholeness, while (Parkes CM 1976)5\r\nWith loss of spouse and (Block WE et al (1963)6 with symbolic castration & even\r\nDeath. The individual’s response to a traumatic event is influenced by personality\r\nTraits, pre-morbid psychological state, gender, peri-traumatic dissociation,\r\nProlonged disability of traumatic events, lack of social support and inadequate\r\nCoping strategies. Previous studies on amputation mainly focused on demographic\r\nProfile, coping skills and outcome; with there being a scarcity of literature on\r\nPrevalence of various specific psychiatric disorders in the post-amputation period.\r\nMost patients with a limb loss irrespective of whether due to traumatic injury or\r\nSurgical procedures go through a series of complex psychological reactions\r\nReported by Cansever et al (2003)8. Most people try to cope with it, those who\r\nDon’t succeed develop psychiatric symptoms Frank et al (1984)7. Shukla et\r\nAl9 noted that psychological intervention in some form is needed in about 50% of\r\nAll amputees, and Shukla et al9 reported depression to be the most common\r\nPsychological reaction following amputation.\r\nThe three major problems faced by many amputees are anxiety, depression and\r\nPhysical disability (Green 2007)\r\nHorgan & maclachlan (2004)10 found that anxiety is associated with depression,\r\nLow self esteem, poorer quality of life and higher level of general anxiety. Both\r\nAnxiety and depression are associated with higher disability as age increases.\r\nBody image is the combination of psychosocial adjustment and attitude of the\r\nIndividual that are related to the function and appearance of one’s own body which\r\nCan be influenced by the individual and his environmental factors (Horgan &\r\nMaclachlan 2004)10. Each person has an idealized body image, which he uses for\r\nMeasuring perceptions and concepts of his or her own body (Fishman, 1959)11.\r\nFrom another perspective, Flannery & Faria (1999) body image is viewed as a\r\nDynamic, changing phenomenon occurring in a person and it is formed by the\r\nConstantly changing perceptions about his body. According to Newell (1991)13,\r\nAttractive people after amputation will receive less reinforcement from others\r\nLeading to low self-esteem and reduced positive self-image. Jacobsen et al (1997)\r\nSupports this stating i.e. Amputation leads to disfigurement which in turn leads to a\r\nNegative body image and greater loss of social acceptance. The relationship\r\nBetween disability experience and stigma are interwoven and inter-dependent. The\r\nReason for the amputee’s subjective perception of being unfit for the society\r\nProbably is that body image provides a sense of ‘’self’ ’and also affects the\r\nPersons thinking (Wald 2004)1. According to Kolb (1975)14, changes in body\r\nImage may cause series of psychological reactions.\r\nThe psychiatric aspect of amputation has received scant interest in our country, in\r\nSpite of accidental injuries being common (Shukla et al., 1982)9. The commonest\r\nPsychiatric disorder seen in amputees is major depression. Randall et al. (1945)15\r\nHave reported an incidence of 61 % in non-battle casualties, while Shukla et al.\r\n(1982)9 found depressive neurosis (40%) and psychiatric depression (22%) to be\r\nThe leading psychiatric disorders in amputees; only 35% of the total sample in the\r\nLater study had nil psychiatric disorders. The paucity of literature in this field has\r\nPrompted us to study about amputation and its co morbid psychiatric conditions so\r\nThat proper care & management for the patients can be planned. The present study\r\nWas undertaken with the aim of studying the psychiatric problems especially\r\nAnxiety, depression and Body Dysmorphic Disorder which may be associated with\r\nDisability or changed life circumstances in the immediate post-amputation period.\r\nA comparison was made with Stroke patients, as these patients often experience\r\nPhysical and social handicaps similar to amputees.\r\nDepression is the most common mood disorder to follow stroke (Starkstein &\r\nRobinson, 1989), with major depression affecting around one quarter to one third\r\nOf patients (Hackett16)..\r\nDepression hampers functional recovery in a post stroke individual. In Diagnostic\r\nAnd statistical manual (DSM) IV Post Stroke Depression classified under “mood\r\nDisorder due to general medical condition (i.e. Stroke)” with the specific depressive\r\nFeatures, major depressive-like episodes, manic features or mixed features. Studies\r\nDescribe that cerebral ischemia is associated with two types of depressive disorder.\r\nIncidence of major and minor depression is 25% and 30% respectively. Prevalence\r\nMay vary over time with an apparent peak 3months after the stroke and\r\nSubsequently decline in prevalence at 1 year. Robinson and colleagues studies\r\nShowed a spontaneous remission in the natural course of major depression\r\nOccurring post stroke in the first to second year following stroke. However in few\r\nCases depression may become chronic and persist for a longer period.\r\nWhile some propose that post stroke depression is due to stroke affecting the\r\nNeural circuits concerned with mood regulation (thereby supporting a primary\r\nBiological mechanism), others in the scientific community claim it to be due to the\r\nEnsuing psycho-social stressors occurring as a result of stroke. Though an\r\nIntegrated bio- psycho- social model is warranted, most studies clearly suggest\r\nBiological mechanism to have an upper hand in the later post stroke period than in\r\nThe immediate phase.\r\nIn the same way Anxiety is also common in post stroke individuals with the\r\nIncidence rate being 20%, and it is most common in first three to four months after\r\nThe stroke.\r\nStudies and literatures on post stroke anxiety are very few still remain in its\r\nInfancy. Studies have concentrated on socio-demographic variables, cognitive\r\nFunctions and laterality as examined for post stroke depression. Many studies show\r\nThat there is correlation between anxiety and right hemisphere lesions and also that\r\nCo-morbid post stroke anxiety and depression are associated with left hemisphere\r\nLesions [Astrom, (1996)17]. Many studies have shown the relationship between post\r\nStroke anxiety, age and gender. Women and younger individuals are more\r\nVulnerable to develop post stroke anxiety (Morrison, walter et al 200069), while\r\nAnother study reports no such relationship (Schultz et al).19",

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

      "abstract": "being persecuted.However, a variety of other themes is also possible, for instance the belief that the fillings in one's teeth are radio transmitters receiving extraterrestrial messages, or the belief that some outside agency has added or removed thoughts in one's brain.Negative symptoms, on the contrary, describe loss or significant impairment of normal psychological functions, such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passivity and apathy, and anhedonia (APA, 2000).Although this reduction in normal functioning may seem less dramatic as positive symptoms, particularly negative symptoms are associated with long periods of hospitalization and poor social functioning.Indeed, a patient's degree of negative symptoms appears to determine whether a patient is still able to function in society.Last, cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia comprise 'executive dysfunctions', including problems in maintaining goals, allocating attentional resources, evaluating and monitoring performance, and utilizing these capacities to solve problems. Diathesis-stress hypothesis of schizophreniaSchizophrenia is a complex illness, and its possible causes are still subject of debate.However, according to a widely adopted view, both a biological predisposition, and exposure to environmental stress are necessary ingredients for schizophrenia to become manifest -the so-called diathesis stress model (Zubin & Spring, 1977).A classical example of the association between environmental stress and the risk of developing schizophrenia, comes from studies of the 1944-1945 Dutch Hunger Winter (Susser & Lin, 1992;Susser et al., 1996;Susser et al., 1998).In this discrete period during the Second World War, there was a serious decline in food intake in six cities of western Netherlands.Among people born in these cities between 1944 and 1946, the most exposed birth cohort (i.e., conceived at the height of the famine) showed a twofold and statistically significant increase in the risk for developing schizophrenia (Susser & Lin, 1992).Since this particular famine, many others occurred worldwide, but these were less suitable for epidemiological investigations due to more disorganized conditions (St Clair et al., 2005).However, several years after the Dutch Hunger Winter, a similar occasion occurred in China.Specifically, from 1959-1961, people in affected provinces were starving and died in large numbers due to bad weather (for refs see (St Clair et al., 2005)).Among births that occurred during the famine years, the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life was significantly increased when compared to those born before or afterwards (St Clair et al., 2005).These 'natural experiments' suggest that prenatal stress, i.e., exposure to maternal nutritional deficiency, could increase the risk of schizophrenia in later life.However, evidence from many observational studies that have investigated the association between experience of stress in adulthood and acute onset of psychotic illness, has not been confirmative (Phillips et al., 2007).In particular, there is no consistent evidence that experience of stressful life events is able to trigger onset of psychosis.Findings from longitudinal studies on the other hand, are stronger in linking episodes of relapse in schizophrenia patients to an elevated rate of stressful life events (Phillips et al., 2007;Walker et al., 2008), thus providing additional evidence for a role of stress exposure in (the course of) schizophrenia.

      "abstract": "A person's well-being and health are greatly affected by disorders of sleep and wakefulness. It is of the utmost importance to diagnose and treat such conditions, since the associated daytime sleepiness is a major risk factor for accidents. Early establishment of the correct diagnosis paves the way to achieving an excellent therapeutic outcome. Health-economic requirements of appropriateness and necessity mandate the specific use of cost- and time-intensive examinations in the sleep laboratory. In accordance with the guidelines for \"non-restorative sleep\", severe and chronic sleep disorders can be diagnosed outside the sleep lab if the underlying cause can already be identified on the basis of the patient's history. Such is usually the case in sleep disorders caused by external influences, disturbed circadian rhythm or pre-existing neurological, psychiatric or internal disorders. Standardized questionnaires are used to record and evaluate the patient's complaints, and vigilance testing to assess impaired sustained attention during the day. Excessive daytime sleepiness is quantified by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). In the case of some disorders such as apnoea, or periodic leg movements, simplified ambulatory methods have been developed to enable their detection at an early stage. The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the sleep lab is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. The relevant biosignals for the assessment of sleep, respiration, heart function, the cardiovascular system and movement are well established. Some of the sensors employed need further improvement. Numerous methods for signal analysis are still undergoing development, and currently available automatic evaluation systems are not yet reliable enough to obviate the need for manual interpretation.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Stiff musclesMuscle stiffness, spasms and cramps are common com- plaints.This review will concentrate on those rare conditions in which these symptoms are caused by continuous muscle activity of either central or peripheral origin. Stiff-man syndromeThis syndrome is of insidious onset, usually in the 4th and 5th decades and affects men and women equally. 1-5Tightness and stiffness of the trunk are early symptoms and are due to continuous contraction of lumbar and abdominal muscles.Axial rigidity progresses slowly over months or years.Abdominal wall rigidity (\"board-like\") and contraction of thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles produce a characteristic hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine which persists at rest.So typical of the condition is this posture that the diagnosis should be questioned without it.3Voluntary movements of the trunk and legs become slow, awkward and restricted.Proximal limb muscles become involved later, but face and distal limbs are generally spared.Muscle spasms, superimposed on the muscle rigidity, are common early complaints; spasms are precipitated by voluntary movement, fright or sound and may be painful and severe.Physiological mechanisms for the spasms include exaggerated, non-habituating exter- oceptive or cutaneomuscular reflexes,6 brainstem myo- clonus8 and exaggeration of the startle reflex.9\" The term \"jerking stiff-man\" syndrome refers to prominence of the latter in some cases.8Sphincter function is normal.The remainder of the neurological examination, including cognition, cranial nerves, muscle strength, tendon reflexes, sensation and coordination is normal.Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is present in one to two thirds of patients.24Autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia and vitiligo are also common.Epilepsy in the stiff-man syndrome occurs in about 10%.4 l Electromyography of affected muscles reveals con- tinuous motor unit activity, despite attempted relaxation, comprising motor units of normal morphology.Peripheral nerve conduction is normal.A central origin for the spasms, rigidity and continuous motor unit activity is suggested by their disappearance during sleep and after peripheral nerve block and spinal or general anaesthesia.Abnormal excitability of spinal interneuronal networks (and their descending control) has been suggested as one cause of the stiff-man syndrome,6\" explaining the axial on August 19, 2023 by guest.",

      "title": "Psychological parameters of psoriasis",
      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory scaling dermatosis. The marked visible appearance of the lesions have a negative impact on body image that leads to decreased self-esteem, hence seriously compromising the patient's quality of life. The clinical picture critically affects the social well-being of the patient since the disease is commonly misunderstood and feared by the social environment as being contagious. The patient feels stigmatized and this further intensifies their lack of self-confidence and self-esteem. Feelings of shame and guilt increase the tendency toward suicidal ideation. The poor quality of life of psoriatic patients has been associated with excessive alcohol consumption, increased smoking and greater use of tranquilizers, sedatives and antidepressants. As far as mental impairment is concerned, a correlation has been found between psychological stress and the clinical severity of symptoms: the more mentally affected the patient, the more severe the dermatologic lesions. Similarly, stressful life events constitute a major risk for the occurrence and recurrence, exacerbating the severity and duration of the symptoms. Depression and anxiety can worsen the disease or cause resistance to treatment or patient's indifference, which in turn can lead to expensive and prolonged treatment. Not least, the disease itself contributes to anxiety, depression and psychological stress, thus creating a \"vicious circle\" that is difficult to manage. Given that women seem to invest more in their personal appearance than men, it is hardly surprising that female psoriatic patients report higher levels of depression. Similarly, the risk of mental disorders is also higher in younger patients for whom body image plays an equally significant role. The severity of the disease, side effects of therapy and mental disorders are among the causes that have been attributed to sexual dysfunction reported by some psoriatic patients. At the social level, stigma, social rejection, feelings of shame, embarrassment and lack of confidence provoked by the disease often lead to the discontinuation of daily activities and social withdrawal. This review attempts to describe the prevalence of psychological stress and its negative social impact on patients with psoriasis. The recognition and treatment of these psychosocial problems may contribute to improving the quality of life for patients and reduce treatment costs. The collaboration between the psychiatrist and the dermatologist is a fundamental prerequisite toward addressing these issues.",

      "abstract": "Strokes are sometimes associated with other types of stroke syndromes such as pusher syndrome. This pathology consists of an impairment of the postural and visual perception of the verticality of the body with respect to gravity, but not of the perception of the orientation of the surrounding environment. Clinically this translates into a patient constantly trying to push his or her arm or leg from the healthy side towards the haemiparetic side in an attempt to regain verticality, causing a high risk of falling towards the affected side. They also offer resistance to passive postural correction. It usually concurs with stroke profiles with more extensive or severe involvement, such as an intraparenchymal stroke, or those in which the posterolateral region of the thalamus and/or the posterior crus of the internal capsule are involved. It is not entirely clear whether it tends to be associated to a greater extent with cases of hemineglect, aphasia or somatosensory loss, nor whether it seems to be more correlated with right hemisphere involvement, as there are very heterogeneous data depending on the type of study. However, it seems clear that the prognosis worsens when this syndrome occurs when the right hemisphere is affected, delaying recovery times (p=0.027).",

      "title": "Neurobiological evidence for epilepsy-induced interictal disturbances.",
      "abstract": "It is not in the best interest of persons with epilepsy to deny the possibility that seizures could cause enduring behavioral disturbances. Rather, it is essential to pursue clinical and animal investigations in order to identify any such changes that might occur and to elucidate their mechanisms. Many testable hypotheses can be developed from existing evidence. Antiepileptic medication may produce interictal behavioral disturbances in patients with epilepsy by indirect mechanisms. Some aberrant behaviors could be due to medication-induced systemic disorders, neuroendocrine dysfunction, or REM deficit, whereas depression following successful treatment with drugs, as well as with surgery, may be related more specifically to cessation of seizures. The underlying neuropathological process also induces neurological and mental deficits, but it is not always possible to differentiate those behavioral disturbances due to destructive effects of the lesion from those due to recurrent epileptic seizures. Behavioral disturbances are associated more frequently with epileptogenic lesions in limbic structures than with those elsewhere in the brain, but a relationship between hemispheric lateralization of the epileptogenic lesion and specific interictal behavioral symptoms remains controversial. When considering the effects of seizures per se on interictal behavior, it is important to realize that some \"interictal\" behavioral disturbances may actually be ictal events. Prolonged affective, autonomic, and psychic disturbances can occur in clear consciousness with unilateral limbic seizures that are not associated with scalp EEG changes. When epilepsy is acquired as a result of cerebral damage, the epileptogenic process takes time to develop before spontaneous seizures appear. It is more reasonable to assume that this progressive process continues than to postulate that it stops completely at the time the first seizure occurs. Epilepsy-induced protective homeostatic mechanisms that act to terminate ictal events, prevent ictal spread, and maintain the interictal state may also disrupt interictal function. Furthermore, seizures could indirectly influence interictal behavior as a result of their effects on neuroendocrine function and sleep. Because of confounding biological factors, it is difficult to document the association of any epilepsy disorder, by itself, with progressive behavioral disturbances in humans. Secondary epileptogenesis, protective homeostatic mechanisms, and epilepsy-induced disturbances in development can be readily demonstrated, however, in experimental animal models. In experimental animals, endogenous opoids are released during seizures and mediate some postictal behaviors. A physiological dependency on high levels of endogenous opioids released during seizures could produce depression as a withdrawal symptom interictally or when seizures no longer occur as a result of successful therapy. Experimental animal models of depression exist to test hypotheses concerning pro- and antidepressant effects of epileptogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "title": "Current concepts in concussion: evaluation and management.",
      "abstract": "Concussion is a disturbance in brain function caused by direct or indirect force to the head. It is a functional rather than structural injury that results from shear stress to brain tissue caused by rotational or angular forces-direct impact to the head is not required. Initial evaluation involves eliminating cervical spine injury and serious traumatic brain injury. Headache is the most common symptom of concussion, although a variety of clinical domains (e.g., somatic, cognitive, affective) can be affected. Signs and symptoms are nonspecific; therefore, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptoms must be determined. There are numerous assessment tools to aid diagnosis, including symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. These tools are also used to monitor recovery. Cognitive and physical rest are the cornerstones of initial management. There are no specific treatments for concussion; therefore, focus is on managing symptoms and return to play. Because concussion recovery is variable, rigid classification systems have mostly been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. A graded return-to-play protocol can be implemented once a patient has recovered in all affected domains. Children, adolescents, and those with a history of concussions may require a longer recovery period. There is limited research on the management of concussions in children and adolescents, but concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain suggests that a more conservative approach to management is appropriate in these patients.",

Psychological conditions can occur at any age, and a person’s age is just one of many factors to be considered when assessing, formulating, and treating these complications. The commonest and most salient psychological conditions after stroke are anxiety, depression, fatigue, and emotionalism. Other more subtle presentations include low self-esteem, low confidence, reduced self-efficacy, altered identity, and post-traumatic stress. In approaching psychological conditions, it is important to be mindful that most are not limited to the acute phase. The delivery of psychological care is not necessarily the domain of specialists alone; service models such as stepped care may engage a range of staff in helping with less severe presentations. The ubiquitous nature of psychological conditions requires approaches that enable large numbers to be assessed and treated cost-effectively. Group-based approaches and self-management are particularly important additions to resource-intensive one–to-one therapy.",

      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery. The Babylonians were the first to describe the clinical foundations of neurology and psychiatry. We discuss these accounts in relation to subsequent and more modern clinical descriptions.",

      "abstract": "Compulsive sexual behaviours are relatively rare and are not known to be associated with social phobias, with an intense scientific debate on going if it constitutes a behavioral addiction. Compulsive sexual behaviours otherwise known as Hypersexuality/problematic sexual behaviour and is identified by a persistent pattern of failure to control repetitive, intense urges, fantasies and behaviours of a sexual nature over an extended period of time that causes marked impairment in multiple areas of functioning, in this case, especially educational functioning. Phobic anxiety disorders also known as social phobias are a group of conditions in which anxiety is triggered typically in well-defined situations that are not currently dangerous with resulting avoidance of such situations. Nevertheless, CSB is not captured in DSM V and ICD10, although, diagnostic criteria were proposed during DSM V revision, it is not currently recognized in the DSMV. Although, CSB has been proposed for inclusion in ICD 11 as an impulse control disorder, rather than as a mental and behavioural disorder as previously debated, in addition, strict diagnostic guidelines were instituted due to concerns of over pathologizing sexual behaviours. This presents a diagnostic and treatment dilemma for the psychiatrist when a patient presents with symptoms of Compulsive sexual behaviours with or without anxiety, since there are presently no diagnostic and treatment guidelines. We present the case of a 23 year old 3rd year medical student with a 5 year history of compulsive masturbation, persistent pornography viewing, failure to resist impulses and fantasies with accompanying intense distress especially following periods of abstinence and a two year history of recurrent panic attacks in social settings in which women were triggers complicated by depressive symptoms, symptoms significantly impaired most areas of functioning particularly his academics.\r\n\r\n A diagnosis of Social Phobia/Social Anxiety disorder with episodic panic attacks and compulsive sexual behaviours and mild depressive episode was made because patient met criteria according to ICD 10 and proposed ICD 11. Mental state examination shows anxious mood, congruent with affect, depersonalization, derealization as well as anxious ruminations. Within a year, after commencement of an SSRI, Atenolol and Lisonopril and CBT all anxiety symptoms resolved with marked reduction in the frequency of pornography viewing as well as compulsive masturbation with associated fantasies. This case report lends voice to the on-going debate about the inclusion of compulsive sexual behaviours as a mental and behavioural disorder Dependence syndrome in diagnostic classification systems as well as the need for development of standardized appropriate treatment modalities. This case report will highlight Compulsive Sexual Behaviours, rationale for its inclusion as an addiction in classification systems and treatment approaches to the disorder.",

      "title": "The Role of Stress in the Pathogenesis and Maintenance of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often identify psychosocial stress as a factor that exacerbates their symptoms, and many trace the onset of symptoms to a stressful period of life or a discrete traumatic incident. However, the pathophysiological relationship between stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder remains poorly characterized: it is unclear whether trauma or stress is an independent cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms, a triggering factor that interacts with a preexisting diathesis, or simply a nonspecific factor that can exacerbate obsessive-compulsive disorder along with other aspects of psychiatric symptomatology. Nonetheless, preclinical research has demonstrated that stress has conspicuous effects on corticostriatal and limbic circuitry. Specifically, stress can lead to neuronal atrophy in frontal cortices (particularly the medial prefrontal cortex), the dorsomedial striatum (caudate), and the hippocampus. Stress can also result in neuronal hypertrophy in the dorsolateral striatum (putamen) and amygdala. These neurobiological effects mirror reported neural abnormalities in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may contribute to an imbalance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, an imbalance that is implicated in the pathogenesis and expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology. The modulation of corticostriatal and limbic circuits by stress and the resultant imbalance between habit and goal-directed learning and behavior offers a framework for investigating how stress may exacerbate or trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology.",

      "abstract": "Since the Gulf War, investigation continues of symptoms and illnesses among its veterans. Yet, identifying a specific \"Gulf War Syndrome\" remains elusive. With new disease entities, causal associations are relatively easily established when the condition is serious, verifiable, and has excess disease rates in specific groups. In common conditions, many excess cases are required to establish association with a specific exposure. Establishing causality in syndromes with variable symptoms is difficult because specific diagnostic algorithms must be established before causal factors can be properly investigated. Searching for an environmental cause is futile in the absence of an operational disease case definition. Common subjective symptoms (without objective physical or laboratory findings) account for over one-half of all medical outpatient visits, yet these symptoms lack an identified physical cause at least one-third of the time. Our medical care system has difficulty dealing with disorders where there is no identified anatomic abnormality or documented metabolic/physiological dysfunction.",

Among the various work stressors to which people may be exposed, long work hours combined with lack of sleep is a major risk factor in our society. Irregular work hours, shift work, frequent work-related trips, working in a cold or noisy environment, and jet lag are also potent risk factors for workers. In addition, the chronic effects of psychological job strain, which can be concep- tualized by the job demand-control-support model, are related to cardiovascular disease. In this model, high job demand and low work control accompanied by low social support at work are the most harmful to health.

      "title": "Concussion",
      "abstract": "Concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury, is common, and occurs both in sport and as a result of falls or accidents. Concussion has become an increasingly recognized public health concern, largely driven by prominent media coverage of athletes who have sustained concussion. Although much has been written about this condition, its natural history is still not well understood, and practitioners are only now beginning to recognize that concussion often manifests in different clinical domains. These may require targeted treatment in and of themselves; otherwise, persistent post-concussive symptoms may develop. Although most individuals who sustain a concussion recover, and although concussion is a treatable condition, it is important that concussion be managed early and comprehensively to avoid a more prolonged clinical trajectory. A relatively recent term often used in the setting of concussion is repetitive head impact exposure—a biomechanical force applied to the head that does not generate a clinical manifestation of concussion, but may result in structural brain changes. Although it is often assumed that repetitive head impact exposure leads to long-term neurological sequelae, the science to document this assumption is in its infancy. Repeated concussions may lead to depression or cognitive impairment later in life, and there is an emerging literature that repeated concussion and repetitive head impact exposure are associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or other neurodegenerative diseases. Currently there is no known causal connection between concussion, repetitive head impact exposure, and neurodegeneration, although this research is also still in its infancy.",

A detailed and accurate medical history (plus family history, use of medication and eating habits) often easily leads to the diagnosis.

      "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disorder in children, adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Primary care physicians, not mental health professionals, treat the majority of patients with symptoms of depression. Persons who are depressed have feelings of sadness, loneliness, irritability, worthlessness, hopelessness, agitation, and guilt that may be accompanied by an array of physical symptoms. A diagnosis of major depression requires that symptoms be present for two weeks or longer. Identifying patients with depression can be difficult in busy primary care settings where time is limited, but certain depression screening measures may help physicians diagnose the disorder. Patients who score above the predetermined cut-off levels on the screening measures should be interviewed more specifically for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder and treated within the primary care physician's scope of practice or referred to a mental health subspecialist as clinically indicated. Targeted screening in high-risk patients such as those with chronic diseases, pain, unexplained symptoms, stressful home environments, or social isolation, and those who are postnatal or elderly may provide an alternative approach to identifying patients with depression.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "title": "Treatments in depression",
      "abstract": "Major depression is believed to be a multifactorial disorder involving predisposing temperament and personality traits, exposure to traumatic and stressful life events, and biological susceptibility. Depression, both unipolar and bipolar, is a \"phasic\" disease. Stressful life events are known to trigger depressive episodes, while their influence seems to decrease over the course of the illness. This suggests that depression is associated with progressive stress response abnormalities, possibly linked to impairments of structural plasticity and cellular resilience. It therefore appears crucial to adequately treat depression in the early stages of the illness, in order to prevent morphological and functional abnormalities. While evidence suggests that a severely depressed patient needs antidepressant drug therapy and that a non-severely depressed patient may benefit from other approaches (ie, \"nonbiological\"), little research has been done on the effectiveness of different treatments for depression. The assertion that the clinical efficacy of antidepressants is comparable between the classes and within the classes of those medications may be true from a statistical viewpoint, but is of limited value in practice. The antidepressant drugs may produce differences in therapeutic response and tolerability. Among the possible predictors of outcome in depression treatment, those derived from clinical assessment, neuroendocrine investigations, polysomnographic sleep parameters, genetic variables, and brain imaging techniques have been extensively studied. This article also reviews therapeutic strategies used when initial treatment fails, and describes briefly new concepts in antidepressant therapies such as the regulation of disturbances in circadian rhythms. The treatment of depressive illness does not stop with treatment of acute episodes, and has to be envisaged as a continuous therapeutic intervention, of which we are still not able to determine the optimal duration of treatment and the moment that it should be ceased.",

      "abstract": "In several prospective studies it has been demonstrated that psychological factors are better predictors of low back pain than biographical or medical factors. The most elaborate model for the development of chronic low back pain is the model of fear avoidance. The essential feature of this model is that exaggerated negative orientations towards pain (\"pain catastrophizing\") lead to fear of movements and the belief that movements will lead to more pain. The result is the perpetuation of avoidance behavior. This leads to inactivity, reduced mobility, increased disability, and increased anger, demoralization, anxiety, and depression. From fear avoidance models several principles for the therapeutic management of pain can be derived. Therapists have to be aware of the powerful effects of anticipating processes which can give rise to fear of pain, amplifying the intensity of pain, and consequently result in avoidance behavior. On the other hand, reduction of uncertainty via adequate information about the non-serious nature of back pain disorders may lead to an adequate confrontative pain behavior, less emotional arousal and more useful coping mechanisms. In particular, the uncritical use of widespread back schools has to be looked upon carefully for pronouncing avoidance learning. For chronic pain, therapy must include mechanisms from the treatment of phobias in which pain behavior is looked upon as the result of a phobic process.",

The symptoms are characteristic of dysfunction in multiple organ systems, wax and wane according to exposure to low levels of chemical agents in the patient's environment, and sometimes begin after a distinct environmental change or insult such as an industrial accident or remodeling. Although traditional medical organizations have not agreed on a definition for this syndrome, it is being increasingly recognized and makes up an increasing percentage of the caseload at occupational/environmental medicine clinics. The prominence of pulmonary complaints and the specific overlaps with asthma symptomatology make it a challenge for the practicing pulmonologist, Recognition of pulmonary aspects of psychiatric syndromes such as hyperventilation, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorders is critical to optimum management and therapy. Although there is often dispute about whether the symptoms have a functional or organic basis, an informed approach to evaluation, diagnosis, and management and a careful assessment of impairment, disability, and work relatedness are necessary. Careful exclusion of organic causes, both toxicologic and nontoxicologic, is critical, followed by a judicious approach to coping with what at the end of practical evaluation seems to be mostly functional symptoms.

Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical impairments are common sequelae of TBI and may, in a significant minority of patients, persist well into the late period following injury. The etiology of these symptoms in individuals with mild TBI is controversial, with hypotheses of postconcussive symptom formation variously ascribing greater or lesser weight to neural damage, pre- and/or post-injury psychological or psychiatric factors, somatization, malingering, or some combination of these. Some of these hypotheses reflect biases common to medicolegal or compensation-related contexts, whereas others are derived from recent neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies. Studies of the latter sort suggest that many of the typical postconcussive symptoms are associated with neurobiological dysfunction in one or more areas of the central nervous system. Whether these symptoms constitute a postconcussive syndrome per se is debatable. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe them as commonly co-occurring symptoms rather than as a syndromal sequela of TBI. The present review addresses these issues including the epidemiology and course of recovery from mild TBI and the validity of the postconcussive syndrome. Suggestions regarding the assessment and treatment of individuals with post-concussive symptoms are offered.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a major public health problem. According to the World Health Organization (OMS), depression is currently the second cause of disability in developing countries. Depression is also one of the most frequent mental illnesses. When treating depression, the main objective is to achieve complete remission and to prevent recurrence. Unfor-tunately, in clinical practice, this aim is particularly difficult to reach. Indeed, in clinical trials and in naturalistic studies, remission levels are rather low. The challenge is to individualize the treatment of depression taking account clinical specificities, but also advances in the field of biological and genetic research. Today, intense psychiatric research tries to discover biomarkers to predict treatment response. Because individuals are highly different from a biological, psychological and sociological point of view, more personalized therapeutic approaches are recommended.",

We performed the DST in 95 depressed inpatients to determine whether abnormal DST results were associated with individual symptoms of depression, latent behavioral \"factors,\" melancholia, or severity of depression. Initial insomnia, agitation, loss of sexual interest, and weight loss correlated significantly with nonsuppression. Using multiple regression, these four symptoms contributed independently to the variance in DST results and more closely associated with the DST results than did severity or the diagnosis of melancholia or endogenous subtype. Factor analysis failed to identify a factor that correlated with the DST results more significantly than did the individual symptoms. Our findings and a literature review suggest that DST nonsuppression associates with certain vegetative signs of depression but not with such symptoms as loss of interest or anhedonia nor with \"psychological\" symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, helplessness, hopelessness, or suicidal ideation.",

The urge to steal is often associated with tension or anxiety; the act of stealing may be pleasurable and gratifying at the moment, but it is often associated with guilt and remorse afterwards. Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder (ICD) that frequently emerges during adolescence. It is more common in women than men and is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, especially other ICDs, substance use, and mood disorders. Individuals with kleptomania suffer in their social and occupation functioning and many face legal consequences related to stealing. Although no specific treatment has been empirically supported, preliminary data suggest that the opioid antagonist naltrexone and cognitive behavioral strategies may be helpful. Management of co‐occurring conditions is also important. Further research into the epidemiology, psychology, neurobiology, and treatment of kleptomania is greatly needed.",

This paper reviews the relevant literature. Reported associations between Maternity Blues and psychiatric disorder are examined. Possible psychological, social and biochemical determinants are reviewed, but no firm inferences on causation can yet be drawn. Conflicting results in the literature may have been due to variations in definition and measurement of the syndrome. The authors have recently used psychometric methods to develop a questionnaire for detecting and measuring Maternity Blues. By cluster analysis of responses to the questionnaire, a 'Primary Blues' cluster was defined, consisting of 7 items: tearful, tired, anxious, over-emotional, up and down in mood, low spirited, muddled in thinking. The item 'depression' appeared in another less frequent cluster.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain: What Does It Mean? A Review on the Use of the Term Chronic Pain in Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Chronic pain is nowadays used as an umbrella term referring to a wide range of clinical conditions, such as fibromyalgia, migraine, or long-standing pain states without actual known causes. However, labeling a patient's clinical condition with the term \"chronic pain\", when dealing with pain lasting longer than 3 months, might be misleading. This paper aims at analyzing the possible pitfalls related to the use of the term \"chronic pain\" in the clinical field. It appears, indeed, that the term \"chronic pain\" shows a semantic inaccuracy on the basis of emerging scientific evidences on the pathogenesis of different long-standing pain states. The major pitfalls in using this label emerge in clinical settings, especially with patients having a biomedical perspective on pain or from different cultures, or with healthcare providers of other medical specialties or different disciplines. A label solely emphasizing temporal features does not help to discern the multifaceted complexity of long-standing pain states, whose onset, maintenance and exacerbation are influenced by a complex and interdependent set of bio-psycho-social factors. Thus, finding a more meaningful name might be important. We call upon the necessity of bringing awareness and implementing educational activities for healthcare providers, as well as for the public, on the biopsychosocial approach to assess, prevent and care of chronic pain. Further research on the etiopathogenetic processes of chronic pain states is also required, together with examinative diagnostic methods, to individuate the most appropriate label(s) representing the complex long-standing pain states and to avoid adopting the term \"chronic pain\" inappropriately.

      "abstract": "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), historically referred to as pseudoseizures or hysterical seizures, are sudden disturbances of motor, sensory, autonomic, cognitive, or emotional functions that can mimic epileptic seizures. PNES have a psychologic etiology related to dissociative disorders or conversion disorders, as opposed to the abnormally excessive neuronal activity found in epileptic seizures. Psychosocial conflicts are essentially converted into physical symptoms, resulting in seizure-like symptoms. This case report presents a 42-year-old male with a past history of child abuse, drug abuse, schizoaffective disorder, prior psychiatric hospitalizations, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was admitted to the behavioral health unit with recurrent seizure-like episodes. These episodes were witnessed in the ED, however, appropriate workup failed to confirm abnormal neural activity or evidence of any brain injury. The patient was admitted to the psychiatric service where he was monitored for additional epileptic activity using long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring (LT-VEEG). While subsequent clinical events that resembled epileptic seizures were observed, the LT-VEEG failed to identify any epileptic activity. A diagnosis of PNES was established and a decision was made for the patient to remain on his current antiepileptic, psychiatric, and diabetes medications during his hospitalization. He showed gradual improvement during his stay and confirmed an understanding of his diagnosis. He was released three days later with instructions for follow-up and continued treatment with his outpatient psychiatrist. Early therapeutic counseling in patients who have a differential diagnosis of PNES should be considered to help identify and address the underlying causes of the seizure activity in an effort to curtail these seizure-like events.",

      "title": "Grief: Aetiology, Symptoms and Management",
      "abstract": "Abstract Grief is a process provoked as a response to different losses, such as death, loss of job, relationship breakdown, some unexpected life events and changes, etc. The experiences of loss and bereavement are very individual. Even though loss is expected, the person feels traumatized, especially if death is provoked by violence, natural disasters, or war. This pandemic, like other disasters (wars, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, etc.) has provoked intensive reactions of grief, reactions that could persist for years. The core symptoms of grief are described in the ICD-11 and DSM-5 manuals. The term “complicated grief” in the medical sense refers to a superimposed process that alters grief and modifies its course for the worse. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is characterized by normal grief symptoms, but these are symptoms that remain too intense for too long of a period. This article is a review of the manifestations and duration of grief in different occasions, and it is based on over 50 published papers, and discoveries in the Medline and Psych-Net databases. Commonly described reactions to grief are: shock, disbelief or denial, a high level of anxiety, distress, anger, sadness, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. As predictors for a high/slow decreasing trajectory of grief process are: female gender, reported symptoms of depression before the traumatic event, and higher scores on avoidance. However, grief is transient, even as we are is in the midst of its clutches. People should expect to fluctuate between moments of sadness and mourning, and moments of acceptance, or even happiness for being alive. Researchers suppose that when a crisis passes; most people will be able to bounce back and move on with their lives.",

      "abstract": "Unhealed trauma causes distress in the body. When the nature of the distress overrides a person's existing system for coping, or the trauma is not processed, survivors may numb themselves or seek a more pleasurable experience to escape. Such behavior is a completely natural response to unprocessed trauma. This book continues challenging the existing paradigms for treating addiction and related issues. Despite the longstanding existence of professional treatment in North America, recidivism is high. People are still dying at alarming rates not just from the opioid crisis that dominates news headlines, also from the impact of alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, and other maladaptive behaviors. Moreover, the social isolation and collective trauma caused by the <abbrev>COVID-19</abbrev> pandemic added fuel to an already raging fire, revealing massive cracks in a system for care that is barely functional.

The literature and practice knowledge in the field of addictions have long identified untreated posttraumatic stress disorder as a relapse risk factor.

      "title": "Neuropsychological triggering factors in musicians with focal dystonia",
      "abstract": "Focal dystonia is a\n neurological movement disorder which affects the fine motor control of a\n specific body location. In professional musicians, a limb or the embouchure\n involved in playing a musical instrument may be impacted. Focal dystonia in\n musicians (FDM) is characterised by a loss of\n voluntary motor control and can be a career-ending condition. The\n pathophysiology of focal dystonia, which remains incompletely understood, is\n mainly associated with dysfunction of basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits, with impaired\n inhibition and dysfunctions of sensorimotor pathways. FDM is triggered by various\n neuropsychological and environmental factors. However the existence of\n psycho-psychiatric comorbidities and their possible impact on and/or\n contribution to the manifestation of FDM remains under-investigated. Recent\n studies have revealed that motor function can be altered as a result of\n psychological or psychiatric conditions, suggesting common neurobiological\n networks. Studies conducted in other forms of focal dystonia have uncovered\n psychiatric or other psychological comorbidities such as obsessions, phobias,\n anxieties and depression, whereas a limited number of investigations with FDM\n patients have mainly indicated elevated levels of anxiety and perfectionism.\n The aim of the current thesis was to provide new insights into the\n psychopathology of focal dystonia and its possible consequences for motor\n performance in affected musicians. The investigation was divided into three\n different studies (chapters), each exploring a different aspect of the\n overall topic.\n The first chapter comprises\n a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the psychological profile of FDM\n patients based on standardised psycho-diagnostic\n instruments. Findings indicate that in comparison to healthy controls, half\n of the FDM patients exhibited elevated instances of psychological traits\n related to anxiety, perfectionism and dysfunctional stress-coping features.\n Furthermore, results suggest that these conditions pre-dated the onset of the\n disease and may have contributed as aggravating risk factors to the\n development of FDM. We suggest that the existence of FDM patients with and\n without psychopathology could reflect different mal-adaptive processes\n mediated via different circuits of the cortico-basal\n ganglia-thalamic loops.\n Most of the features in the\n FDM patients diagnosed with psychopathology were related to elevated levels\n of stress and anxiety. Therefore the second chapter focuses on the design of\n a complex experimental paradigm which examines physiological parameters\n (electro-myography [EMG] and fine motor\n performance) in relaxed and stressful conditions, in combination with\n objective assessments (electrocardiography [ECG], cortisol) of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\n (HPA) axis. Due to the fact that no similar paradigm has previously been\n implemented for patients with focal dystonia, a pilot study with a small\n number of patients was conducted. Findings suggest that the experimental\n design is feasible and serves its purpose.\n The final chapter\n encompasses a combined design derived from the first two chapters. Possible\n electrophysiological differences were examined i)\n between FDM patients and healthy controls, ii) among FDM patients before and\n after stress and iii) between\n patients with and without psychopathology. Findings indicate that FDM\n patients are characterised by increased sensitivity to psychosocial\n stressors, in comparison to healthy controls. The impact of stress is\n expressed as an increase in muscular co-contraction of the affected hand, which can be\n explained as a “natural” physiological response under stressful conditions. Finally,\n no motor outcome differences are found between patients with and without\n psychopathology, however results indicate that musicians with psychopathology\n had, on average, developed dystonia around a decade earlier than the\n remainder of the patients, emphasising the contribution of psycho-psychiatric\n conditions to the manifestation of dystonia. Summarising, the current\n thesis suggests the existence of psychopathology in about 50% of musicians\n with focal dystonia. FDM patients with and without psychopathology did not\n differ in their motor performance, however there is clear evidence that\n psychopathology can be an aggravating factor, which may accelerate or even\n trigger the manifestation of dystonia. The current thesis supports the\n concept that motor and psycho-psychiatric features share common\n neurobiological networks in patients with focal dystonia.",

      "title": "[Chronic fatigue syndrome--a disease entity or an unspecified psychosomatic disorder?].",
      "abstract": "In spite of its nature as an often severe and disabeling disease, it is still unclear, whether the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is an entire disease of its own right or not. Moreover, there is a growing evidence that patients with CFS belong to an inhomogeneous group with different etiologic constellations. Specific somatic factors, e.g. viruses, seem to be less important for onset than certain personality-traits like depressiveness and workaholism. These traits lead to an increased vulnerability to unspecific psychological or biological stressors that may cause chronic fatigue by complex psychosomatic interferences. Concerning diagnosis, there are no specific methods or results available, the same is true for pharmacological treatment. As a consequence, practitioners should be aware not to miss a somatic disease causing fatigue, and, parallel to this, start right from the beginning talking about the psychosomatic background of CFS. Furthermore, psychotherapy has shown to be effective in CFS.",

      "title": "MODULASI RESPONS IMUN PADA MENCIT BALB/c YANG STRES AKIBAT STRESOR SUARA",
      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "title": "Neurobiology of Behavior: Anatomic and Physiological Implications Related to Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary: Controversy exists concerning whether epileptic seizures can produce enduring alterations in neuronal function that cause interictal behavioral disturbances. Although arguments favoring the occurrence of epilepsy‐induced disorders of behavior must not be presented in a way that adds to the stigmata associated with epilepsy, it is not in the best interest of epileptic patients to deny this possible relationship and overlook an opportunity to prevent or treat a major cause of disability. There is evidence to suggest that psychosocial factors cannot account for all the behavioral problems suffered by patients with epilepsy. Behavioral disturbances ascribed to antiepileptic drugs and specific structural lesions may also be due, in part, to epileptogenic mechanisms. Some interictal behavioral disturbances may actually reflect unrecognized ictal events. Most importantly, data obtained from clinical research and animal investigations suggest testable hypotheses of how recurrent epileptic seizures can alter neuronal function in ways that would predispose to specific disruptive interictal behaviors, such as aggression, depression and schizophrenia.",

Several psychotropic drug classes and combinations have been associated with a classic clinical syndrome of hyperthermia, skeletal muscle hyper-metabolism, rigidity or rhabdomyolysis, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status ranging from catatonic stupor to coma. It is critical for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for these relatively uncommon drug-induced adverse effects and to become familiar with their management to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. Although these syndromes look alike, they are triggered by quite different mechanisms, and apart from the need to withdraw or restore potential triggering drugs and provide intensive medical care, specific treatments may vary. Clinical similarities have led to theoretical speculations about common mechanisms and shared genetic predispositions underlying these syndromes, suggesting that there may be a common \"thermic stress syndrome\" triggered in humans and animal models by a variety of pharmacological or environmental challenges.",

      "title": "How Anxiety Presents Differently in Older Adults: Age-Related Changes, Medical Comorbidities Alter Presentation and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Although anxiety disorders are common at all ages, there is a misconception that their prevalence drastically declines with age. For this reason anxiety disorders often are underdiagnosed and undertreated in geriatric patients, especially when the clinical presentation of these disorders in older patients differs from that seen in younger adults. In older persons, anxiety symptoms often overlap with medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and geriatric patients tend to express anxiety symptoms as medical or somatic problems such as pain rather than as psychological distress. 1 As a result, older adults often seek treatment for depressive or anxiety symptoms from their primary care physician instead of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, primary care physicians often miss psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders, in geriatric patients. Anxiety may be a symptom of an underlying psychiatric disturbance, secondary to a general medical condition, or induced by dietary substances, substances of abuse, or medications. Late-life anxiety often is comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Box, page 66) and other psychological stressors as older adults recognize declining cognitive and physical functioning. (2) BOX Comorbid anxiety and depression: Highly prevalent, poorer outcomes The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam study--one of the largest epidemiologic studies to examine comorbidity of anxiety disorders and depression in patients age 55 to 85--found that 48% of older persons with primary major depressive disorder (MDD) also had a comorbid anxiety disorder, whereas approximately one-fourth of those with anxiety disorders also had MDD. (a) Pre-existing anxiety disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder, increase the risk of developing depression. Rates of comorbid anxiety and depression increase with age. (c) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Late-life MDD comorbid with generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder is associated with greater memory decline than MDD alone. (d) In addition, comorbid anxiety and depression is associated with greater symptom severity and persistence, greater functional impairment, substance dependence, poorer compliance and response to treatment, worse overall prognosis and outcome than patients with either disorder alone, (e) and greater likelihood of suicidal ideation in older men. (f) Source: For reference citations, see this article at CurrentPsychiatry.com Anxiety disorders commonly begin in early adulthood, tend to be chronic and interspersed with remissions and relapses, and usually continue into old age. (3) In generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there is a bimodal distribution of onset; approximately two-thirds of patients experience onset between the late teens and late 20s and one-third develop the disorder for the first time after age 50. (3) Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders among older adults (age >55) range from 3.5% to 10.2%.(4) These rates are slightly lower than those for younger adults. (5) Among older adults, presence of a 12-month anxiety disorder was associated with female sex, lower education, being unmarried, and having [grater than or equal to]3 or more chronic conditions. (6) Anxiety and disability risk Anxiety disorders affect geriatric patients more profoundly than their younger counterparts. Persons age >65 who have an anxiety disorder are 3 to 10 times more likely to be hospitalized than younger individuals. (1) Anxiety is associated with high rates of medically unexplained symptoms, increased use of health care resources, chronic medical illness, low levels of physical health-related quality of life, and physical disability. (7), (8) Anxiety symptoms may predict progressing physical disability among older women and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living over 1 year. …",

One of the first diagnostic considerations must be the establishment of primary or secondary libidinal dificit, or indeed, whether there is no libido at all. In cases of libido disorders with primary libido dificit, depression, organic disease, or side effects of pharmaca may be the cause. Libido disorders in the presence of functional libido, however, must be regarded as primarily psychologically caused. An exception are libido problems in the presence of diabetes mellitus and peripheral vasculatory defeciencies. In these cases libido is either totally absent or appears only secondarily. The symptomatology of libido disorders in the presence of depression, diabetes melitus, and peripheral vasculatory disturbancies, as well as psychologically caused erectile and ejaculatory difficulties are discussed in detail. These groups are compared with respect to libido and behavior involving erection, ejaculation, anxiety and avoidance.",

      "abstract": "Because of the usual temporal relationship between the menopause and the development of involutional psychoses, there has long been a tendency to link the two conditions in a causal relationship. The organic changes producing the clinical syndrome of the menopause have been thoroughly investigated, and it is now believed that the modus operandi is an exaggerated function of the pituitary resulting from ovarian failure, which can be demonstrated by an increased urinary excretion of gonadotropin. The clinical syndrome itself consists mainly in nervousness, headache, lassitude and depression, insomnia, irritability, hot flashes and various other vasomotor phenomena. Although one may be tempted to correlate some of these symptoms in their aggravated forms with the psychotic melancholia, it is by no means generally agreed that such a physiologic disturbance plays an etiologic role in the development of involutional psychoses. Endocrine derangement in involutional melancholia should be demonstrable objectively in a manner similar",

It is important to distinguish excessive daytime sleepiness from alterations in the level of consciousness, such as lethargy. During the night, a sleeper cycles through a series of sleep stages; this is called “sleep architecture.” Rapid-eye-movement sleep is the state in which most, but not all, dreaming experiences occur.

Each of these factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy. Yet, epidemiological data suggest that depression is the most prevalent disorders among all psychiatric illness in epilepsy. Likewise, several emerging data have explored several multifactorial etiologies of depression in epilepsy. These include underlying genetic, neurochemical, anatomical, neurologic, and iatrogenic factors. Furthermore, clinical investigations have consistently demonstrated that depression has a large impact on subjective health status. In patients with recurrent seizures, depression appears to have a stronger association with QOL than does seizure rates. Unfortunately, however, a significant proportion of patients with epilepsy and depression are not diagnosed nor offered the appropriate treatment. Current treatment recommendations for depression in epilepsy are similar to those for otherwise neurologically normal depressed patients, emphasizing the role of SSRI, but certain antidepressants should be used with caution. Ongoing studies are attempting to define optimal treatment strategies, and more definitive data to guide clinical management is expected to become available in the near future.",

The poor correlation between the degree of degeneration and presence and severity of symptoms is noted. A lack of specific pathology is also a feature of whiplash. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, investigation, and complications of nonspecific neck pain are described with a discussion of the controversial aspects of natural history, prognosis and therapy. Chronic whiplash is very common in some countries, but nonexistent in other countries and the factors which might explain this difference are considered. There is a great need for better quality studies to explore pathogenesis, natural history and factors including therapy that influence outcome.",

In turn, the sick role entitles the factitious disorder patient to care, nurturance, and protection; it also exempts one from usual responsibilities. In this paper, we present the first reported case of factitious pedophilia. Although it seems counterintuitive, this middle-aged man has falsely claimed or exaggerated sexual desire for minors ostensibly to remain in a state hospital; indeed, he has remained in the same inpatient facility for more than 20 years as a result of his deceptions. At times, his reports have included disconfirmed claims of bizarre accidents and other physical travails. This case enlarges the literature on factitious psychological disorders and shows that some individuals may falsify paraphilic behaviors, although clearly minimization of these behaviors remains more common.",

Somatic symptoms of the syndrome have been subject of an extensive body of literature. In comparison, psychiatric aspects have caught relatively less attention. Psychiatric aspects of etiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic concepts are essential for evaluation of the syndrome. Application of CDC-criteria to a well known disease does not solve the nosological problem, but may define the syndrome more accurately. In this respect, issues including psychiatric comorbidity and specificity of neuropathological symptoms are discussed. Psychological variables seem to have a high predictor value for time course and outcome of the symptoms. Etiological concepts emphasize on biological or psychosocial factors. Alterations of biological parameters including immune functions, sleep regulation, and hypothalamic-pituary-adrenocortical function have been reported. The role of cultural factors has been discussed extensively. Somatic and psychological stress may result in the same clinical syndrome via psychoimmunological mechanisms. An integrated, interdisciplinary approach to further refine diagnostic criteria, understanding of etiology and development of adequate therapeutic measures seems necessary.",

Emphasising similarities between mental illness and ‘ordinary’ experience to escape the fear-related prejudices associated with the imagined ‘otherness’ of persons with mental illness risks conclusions that mental illness indicates moral weakness and the loss of any benefits of a medical model. An emphasis on illness and difference from normal experience risks a response of fear of the alien. Thus, a ‘likeness-based’ and ‘unlikeness-based’ conception of psychiatric stigma can lead to prejudices stemming from paradoxically opposing assumptions about mental illness. This may create a troubling impasse for anti-stigma campaigns.",

Continuous assessment of fatigue is a critical component of care for the patient with this debilitating symptom. Initial assessment should incorporate a detailed description of the patient’s fatigue history, its development, symptoms of the condition and any potential causes. Individualised management strategies that may include a combination of interventions can be administered to meet the specific needs of each patient.

Lawyers' anxiety, depression, and suicide rates are likely linked to overwork and exposure to toxic chronic stress. Anxiety and depression can cause changes in the brain that are related to an overactive fight-or-flight stress response system. Lawyer languishing, a state of incomplete mental health, may be a precursor to lawyer's anxiety or depression. The rat-fumbling researcher Hans Seyle noticed that the discomfort his lab rats suffered made them sick. He used the term stress to describe the general unpleasantness his rats experienced when he routinely dropped, chased, and recaptured them during his experiments. The culture of his lab was making his rats sick. When law school or legal practice cultures subject students or lawyers to a broad array of incessant stressors; the general unpleasantness is prone to make them physically and emotionally sick; and it damages their brain.",

Six cases of extreme state dissociation are presented, with a review of the human and animal clinical and experimental literature.

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

In the first part of this review, the relationship between sleep and anxiety is discussed in terms of adaptive response to stress. Recent studies suggested that the corticotropin-releasing hormone system and the locus ceruleus-autonomic nervous system may play major roles in the arousal response to stress. It has been suggested that these systems may be particularly vulnerable to prolonged or repeated stress, further leading to a dysfunctional arousal state and pathological anxiety states, Polysomnographic studies documented limited alteration of sleep in anxiety disorders. There is some indication for alteration in sleep maintenance in generalized anxiety disorder and for both sleep initiation and maintenance in panic disorder; no clear picture emerges for obsessive-compulsive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder. Finally, an unequivocal sleep architecture profile that could specifically relate to a particular anxiety disorder could not be evidenced; in contrast, conflicting results are often found for the same disorder. Discrepancies between studies could have been related to illness severity, diagnostic comorbidity, and duration of illness. A brief treatment approach for each anxiety disorder is also suggested with a special focus on sleep.",

Events such as migration, relocation, job loss, bankruptcy, economic loss, divorce, natural disasters, accidental injury, or the loss of a loved one can trigger the first episode of bipolar disorder. After such life events, symptoms of depressive episodes often appear. Funeral mania, on the other hand, is defined as the emergence of manic episodes following the death of a close family member. Information on funeral mania, which occurs shortly after the loss of a loved one, is limited with a few case reports. In this study, a 26-year-old female patient who presented with the symptoms of a manic episode for the first time after her father's death and who had no previous psychiatric disease or treatment history was presented in the light of findings in the literature. It is noteworthy that the patient, who was followed up with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mania period) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, had a temporal closeness between her mood symptoms and her father's death, and had not developed such a reaction to previous traumatic life events. Therefore, the diagnosis was evaluated as funeral mania. It should be kept in mind that, although rare, symptoms of mania can be seen among possible grief reactions.Strese neden olan ya da örseleyici yaşam olayları duygudurum dönemlerinin ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilir.

In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

This applies not only to endogenous but also to reactive depressions and to various other psychiatric diseases at the bottom of which vital depressive symptoms can be found when investigated.",

      "title": "Insomnia – A Heterogenic Disorder Often Comorbid With Psychological and Somatic Disorders and Diseases: A Narrative Review With Focus on Diagnostic and Treatment Challenges",
      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

Violent acts of minor degree and threats not followed by forensic detention are even much more common. Data on prevalence depend on study conditions, sample selection, and outcome definitions of violence. In psychiatric hospitals, too, violent and threatening behaviour seems to occur most frequently in schizophrenic patients. However, in this respect findings are inconsistent and display considerable variations across different countries and times (with increasing rates reported within the last decade). Additional risk indicators beside the diagnosis of schizophrenia are male gender, comorbidity with personality disorders, substance abuse, lack of adequate treatment and increasing social disintegration due to an unfavourable course of the illness. The violence risk does not seem to decrease with increasing age in contrast to the general population. Beyond these sociodemographic data and variables related to treatment and course of illness, psychopathological causes of violence are less evident. Even imperative hallucinations are not clearly associated with violence; systematic delusions are associated with severe violent acts, but not with the much more frequent violent acts of minor degree. Most probably, the total of psychopathological symptomatology is associated with the proneness to aggressive behaviour. Neuropsychological and biological findings are also inconsistent.",

      "title": "LIVING WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE, EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC DISEASE",
      "abstract": "The way the individual is psychologically affected by the disease depends on many factors. Some of them include the nature of the disease, its severity and treatment, other factors that affect the ability of individuals to cope with the disease related to their personality, circumstances in their life before illness and the level of social support that they have. Regardless of these factors, all individuals pass certain stages while trying to adjust and cope with the reality of the chronic condition. In this paper we review the stages of acceptance of the chronic disease and emotional reactions to the chronic disease such as sadness, fear, anxiety, anger, depression and guilt. When a person finds out that it's diagnosed with chronic illness, first reaction may be shock, denial and disbelief that anything is wrong. The persistence of the symptoms is difficult to ignore. The resistance to the actual changes that occur in the body cause a person to be exerting much more than its body can sustain, creating exhaustion and a growing decrease of strength. In response to the uncertainty of the future, a feeling of anxiety and fear of the possible loss of unrealized goals may appear, which leads to sadness, depression and regret. Additional losses occur in the form of a force to abandon previous roles and responsibilities which leads to a feeling of inadequacy and guilt. A person becomes sensitive to the potential burden that now his loved ones can feel, which leads to more shame and eventual dissatisfaction and anger. The loss of the sense of independence has an impact on self-confidence, self-esteem and self-image, a real identity crisis can appear. As a result of the increased sense of dependence, emotions associated with loss of status, power and control occurs, which exceed once healthy and capable functioning of the individual. Very often a stigma is present which is associated with the illness and may also be a result of reactions from others, including friends and family and all that can cause an increased withdrawal and isolation. The individual becomes affected by a sense of abandonment, rejection and loneliness. Bringing together all these possible reactions, guilt and self-punishment occurs, imposed upon themselves because they have the disease in the first place. In addition to trying to cope with this disease on a daily basis, it is not surprising that the profound nature of these emotional consequences can cause a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. Fortunately, there are ways that a person can learn to move through all the complex reactions and adjustments he is facing, as he will pass through the different stages of the disease.",

Driven by this tension, the animal changes its behaviour. At the same time, alterations occur in bodily functions. All organs and regulatory systems (central and peripheral nervous systems, endocrine and immune systems) participate in these behaviour-physiological response and are affected in their activities. The character of the reactions (e.g. fight, flight, passivity) is mainly determined by the animals appraisal of the environmental change and of the possible impact of its response. Aim of the reactions is neutralising the threat and gaining control over the environment (adaptation). When this is achieved, the tension recedes. In case the response is unsuccessful, the state of tension persists ('chronic stress'). Prolonged exposure of brain and/or bodily functions to stress can result in pathological states.",

Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Increased health-care costs, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline are well-recognized outcomes of delirium. Delirium can interfere dramatically with the recognition and control of other physical and psychological symptoms such as pain in later stages of illness. Delirium is one of the most common mental disorders encountered in general hospital practice. Delirium is highly prevalent in cancer and AIDS patients with advanced disease, particularly in the terminally ill patients in the last weeks of life, with prevalence rates ranging from 20 to 88%. Many of the clinical features and symptoms of delirium can also be associated with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, mania, psychosis, and dementia.",

      "abstract": "A 29-year-old man was admitted because of sudden onset of retrograde amnesia. The patient was unable to recall events having occurred during the past 2 years. The impairment was especially serious with regard to personal memories during the 5 months prior to admission, while he had first been working as a full-time employee under stressful circumstance. A diagnosis of dissociative amnesia was made on the basis of absence of any systemic or neurological diseases that could cause amnesia, the inadaptable character of the patient, the nature of amnesia, and presence of stressful condition possibly related to the amnesia. Visual event-related potential (ERP) studies recorded with human face discrimination tasks demonstrated a P3a wave in response to a face of his superior in the office, whom he said that he had never seen before. The similar P3a wave was observed in response to a face quite familiar to the patient, his mother, but not to a face truly unknown to him. These findings suggest that the visual memory of his superior's face exists in the brain, but the patient is unable to retrieve it by some psychogenic mechanism. 131I-IMP SPECT revealed decreased perfusion in the left medial temporal lobe and the basal forebrain, suggesting the association between dissociative amnesia and focal brain dysfunction. While dissociative amnesia has been understood as psychogenic nature, both ERPs and SPECT are quite important tools to understand the association between the psychological phenomenon and biological changes of the brain in this disorder.",

      "title": "Medical Illnesses in Psychiatric Patients — a Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract There is a high prevalence of physical disorders in psychiatric patients. However, physical disorders often go unrecognised and untreated in routine psychiatric clinical practice. This paper reviews the available literature on the association between medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. There is a well-established relationship between major medical disorders and most psychiatric disorders. Early medical diagnosis in psychiatric patients has important clinical significance. Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or occur as side effects of psychotropic medications. It is important that psychiatrists perform adequate clinical examination of their patients in order to recognise and treat the medical disorders. Remedies suggested are adequate training and research, interdepartmental teaching programmes, refresher courses, and active consultation-liaison services in clinical practice. Key words: Anxiety disorders, Comorbidity, Depressive disorder, Schizophrenia Introduction Medical illnesses are more prevalent in psychiatric patients than in the general population. However, these often go unrecognised and untreated in routine clinical psychiatric practice. (1) Physical disorders may coexist with psychiatric disorders or may occur as side effects of psychotropic medication. Patients suffering from schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders have a higher rate of preventable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of exercise. (2) On the other hand, patients with physical disorders are likely to be non-compliant and have higher dropout, morbidity, and mortality rates. Despite the evidence, psychiatrists consider the medical care of their patients to be beyond the scope of their care. They are also reluctant to perform general physical examination of their patients, fearing that this would disrupt the therapeutic relationship. Two-thirds of psychiatrists have never performed physical examination of their patients. According to the available data, a physical examination is performed on only 13% of inpatients and 8% of psychiatric outpatients. (3) This is of increasing concern for mental health professionals in clinical practice. (4) All major psychiatric disorders, such as depressive disorders, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are closely associated with physical disorders. By understanding the medical problems of psychiatric patients, psychiatrists can explain to their colleagues in other specialties some significant medical findings that may require immediate attention. Since physical and psychiatric comorbidity is relatively common in general practice, these aspects should be given equal importance. (5) Prevalence of Medical Illnesses among Psychiatric Patients Comorbidities between physical and psychiatric disorders are not uncommon. Over the last 30 years, several studies conducted to determine the prevalence of medical illnesses among psychiatric patients reported prevalence rates of 28% to 92% (Table 1). (6-14) In one study, physical illness was underdiagnosed and not diagnosed in 67% and 50% of the patients, respectively. (6) An unusually high prevalence rate of 90% was reported by a study that included 100 state hospital psychiatric patients who were consecutively admitted to a research ward. In this study, 46% of the patients had an unrecognised medical illness that either caused or exacerbated their psychiatric illness, 80% had physical illnesses that required treatment, and 4% exhibited precancerous conditions. (8) In a study by Bunce et al, 50% of 2395 psychiatric outpatients and 52% of 1448 psychiatric inpatients were found to have a major medical disorder. (10) In a study conducted in a public mental health system, 529 psychiatric patients were medically evaluated. The results revealed important physical diseases in 200 patients; 12% of the patients were found to have physical diseases. …",

      "title": "Surgical intensive care unit (ICU) delirium: A “psychosomatic” problem?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication after major surgery and related among other potential medical precipitants to either pre-existing cognitive impairment or the intensity and length of anesthesiology or the type of surgery. Nevertheless, in some rare situations, an organic etiology is not always found, which can be frustrating for the medical team. Some clinicians working in an intensive care unit have a reluctance to seek another hypothesis in the psychological field. Method: To illustrate this, we report the case of a 59-year-old woman who developed a massive delirium during her intensive care unit stay after being operated on for a left retroperitoneal sarcoma. Interestingly, she had had no previous cognitive disorders and a somatic explanation for her psychiatric disorder could not been found. Just before the surgery, she was grieving the recent loss of a colleague of the same age, and also a close friend, and therefore had a death anxiety. Results: With this case report, we would like to point out the importance of psychological factors that might precipitate delirium in a predominately somatic environment such as an intensive care unit. Significance of results: ICU delirium can sometimes be considered as a “psychosomatic” problem with either a stress response syndrome after surgery or a defense mechanism against death anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of such psychological factors even if they always must first rule out potential somatic causes for delirium and encourage thorough investigation and treatment of these medical causes. A collaboration with the psycho-oncologist is recommended to better manage this “psychosomatic” problem.",

      "abstract": "The reporting of physical symptoms is influenced to a large degree by psychological processes. Individuals are more likely to notice subtle sensations in environments lacking in stimulation than those demanding external attention. The beliefs or schemas that people hold dictate where and how they attend to their bodies as well. These normal perceptual processes help explain why people are often poor at accurately detecting internal physiological activity. Several individual differences are also related to the symptom reporting process. Females are more likely to base their symptom reports on external situational cues than are males. In addition, individuals with chronic anxiety--those high in Negative Affectivity (NA)--report more symptoms than those low in NA. Finally, individuals, who have had traumatic experiences, either in childhood or within 1-6 months prior to a major symptom reporting episode, tend to be high symptom reporters. Several recommendations are made to help researchers and clinicians distinguish between psychological or perceptual factors with presumed biological effects. One implication of this work is that MCS and allied syndromes should be viewed as both a mental and a physical health problem.",

Anxiety is a common reaction to a cancer diagnosis and a normal response to perceived threats like loss of body functions, alterations in appearance, family disruption, death, etc. Anxiety may persist throughout the disease process, affecting the patient’s quality of life significantly, and often coexists with depression in cancer patients. Anxiety tends to appear or worsen at critical points during the course of the illness (diagnosis, beginning and end of treatment, recurrence, survival and terminal stage).\r\n\r\nSleep disorders are frequently associated with the psychological impact of cancer as well as with the physical illness itself, pain, hospitalisation and specific medical treatments. Altered sleep adversely affects emotional wellbeing and daytime performance, and may be an early sign of delirium in the oncology setting. In the general population, persistent insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety or depression [2].\r\n\r\nTo effectively adjust patient needs to optimal treatment interventions, health-care professionals must be able to distinguish normal adjustment to cancer from altered reactions to the disease. This paper will focus on anxiety and sleep disorders in the oncology setting and will describe their clinical presentation, assessment, aetiology and treatment.",

Older people may suffer from conditions such as knee osteoarthritis, low back pain, neck pain and headache, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and cancer-related pain. Pain may impact physical function, psychological function, and other aspects of quality of life. A thorough history and physical examination may optimally assess a person with a persistent pain complaint in the context of a multifactorial pathway from accumulated impairments in multiple systems. Older people may perceive that integrative medicine treatments based on lifestyle and lower-risk therapies may help them get relief from pain and improve quality of life. Follow-up evaluation of positive and negative effects of therapeutic modalities and medications may guide the treatment plan.",

      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

These always have certain characteristic features which permit their diagnosis as organic psychotic reactions implanted on the psychosis for which the patient is being treated; they disappear within one or two weeks after the last treatment.

Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Even though recognition of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by the medical community is not yet proportionate to its prevalence in the general population,1RLS was a syndrome reported as early as 1672 by Willis,2 and well defined clinically by Ekbom in 1945 and 1960.3,4 RLS may either occur as a primary disturbance, frequently familial and not associated with other neurological or systemic illnesses, or secondary to other pathological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, uremia, and pregnancy.5 Landmark but serendipitous discoveries, such as its association with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS)6 and the discovery of the therapeutic effects of levodopa,7 were later followed by more systematic approaches aimed at the definition of the clinical diagnostic criteria,8,9 at measuring the degree of clinical severity,10 and of quality of life (QoL).11,12 Accordingly, the essential diagnostic criteria for RLS9 include the following: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting; the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and the urge to move or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. Supportive clinical features include a positive family history, response to dopaminergic therapy, and periodic limb movements during wakefulness or sleep. The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) rating scale for severity10 rates symptoms over 10 items with a score ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe symptom) experienced by the patient for the most recent 2-week period; RLS symptoms are defined as moderate to severe when a score of at least 15 is reached. Recently, diagnostic criteria for thePLMS have also been made available.13 These efforts have brought about previously lacking clinical instruments useful for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, at least for the adult population with RLS, and facilitated the recognition and assessment of the significant effects of RLS upon sleep, cognitive function, and memory and psychomotor performance. Here, the clinical features of RLS will not be tackled, and the reader is directed to more general works;5,14 we shall instead deal first with the consequences of RLS on the function of sleep, and the attendant mood disruption. We shall afterwards summarize the effects of RLS upon cognitive performance and more generally upon QoL. Such a way of dealing with the subject at hand is not meant to imply definite causal relationships between pain, disturbed sleep, mood depression, and finally cognitive defects and poor QoL. All of these clinical features associated with RLS could indeed represent intrinsic properties of the RLS brain or mind.",

A literature review of this latent inhibition (LI) effect indicates that LI is similar in human and other species, although in adult humans it often requires a masking or distracter task. The discrepancy in conditions for producing LI can be accounted for by developmental differences in the automatic processing of unattended stimuli. In adults, automatic processes are subject to a controlled information-processing override. Masking prevents controlled processing of the preexposed stimuli so that they remain unattended. The role of masking in attenuating LI in schizotypal/schizophrenic groups is assessed. It is proposed that schizophrenia is related to an inability to use occasion-setting properties of context or to switch from controlled to automatic processing of inconsequential events.",

      "abstract": "The argument has been advanced that pathological states of anxiety and mania are both characterized by a failure on the part of the patient to attach appropriate levels of significance to changes occurring in the immediate environment. There is, it is suggested, a tendency for environmental features to be regarded as important even though, viewed objectively, they may have little relevance to the patient and his needs. Depression, it is further proposed, may be viewed as an extreme defense reaction to the intense anxiety which results from attaching too much significance to environmental events. In depressive state, patients are often characterised by their lowered responsiveness to stimulation and their lack of interest in, or concern about, their surroundings: it may be that, in such state, information processing has been blocked or reduced. The daytime drowsiness of the depressed patients, as well as his night-time sleep disturbance and the frequently observed recurrent or cyclic nature of certain kinds of depressed state, suggest that this blocking of sensory processing may be brought about by the involuntary intervention of mechanisms responsible, under normal circumstances, for sleep induction. This view of the nature of depression has been recast into the form of five potentially testable hypotheses. Speculation is always easy; providing convincing demonstrations that those speculations are reasonable is less easy. It is in the nature of psychological investigation that laboratory-based studies distort and may even destroy the phenomena about which information is sought, and many a perfectly reasonable theory has foundered upon the rocks of translation into experimental terms. In those areas of psychology which have implications for psychiatry and the conceptualisation of psychopathological states, this danger is particularly evident: psychiatric syndromes are complex, variable, and have social referrents, but laboratory experiments are limited in their capacity to reflect all these attributes, and consequently they may never provide really adequate tests of a theory about a psychiatric state. We have to try to come to terms with this apparent impasse--in the first place by being circumspect in translating psychiatric concepts into experimental terms, and secondly by exercising caution in interpreting the results to which the experiments give rise. More importantly, however, we have to accept the essential inadequacy of the majority of experimental paradigms in psychiatric research and to regard theorizing--even when it is not linked to explicitly testable hypotheses--as having inherent value.",

Se manifiesta por cansancio de mas de 6 meses de evolucion, acompanado de algunos criterios especificos; no mejora con el reposo y no se puede explicar por ninguna alteracion. Este proceso puede provocar desde un distanciamiento social y laboral hasta la marginacion, o afectar otros ambitos de la vida, y supone un factor predisponente para la aparicion de ansiedad y depresion. Esta patologia es aceptada en Espana por la legislacion laboral como causa de baja medica permanente y absoluta en elgunos casos, ya que puede tratarse de un proceso invalidante. Es objetivo de este trabajo repasar los aspectos mas relevantes de dicha patologia, para que el odontologo pueda identificarla y participar en la adopcion de las medidas mas adecuadas, en su caso.",

      "title": "The psychological impact of torture",
      "abstract": "Many refugees in the developed world are survivors of torture and present with health needs without their traumatic experience being disclosed or identified. Chronic pain is a common problem, as are symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other distress. Current circumstances, particularly poverty, uncertainty about asylum, separation from or loss of family and roles, and difficulties settling in the host country, all contribute to current psychological problems and exacerbate existing ones. Psychological treatment studies tend to be focused either on PTSD diagnosis and use protocol-driven treatment, usually in the developed world, or on multiple problems using multimodal treatment including advocacy and welfare interventions, usually in the developing world. Reviews of both of these, and some of the major criticisms, are described. Psychological interventions tend to produce medium-sized changes in targeted measures of distress, when compared with waiting lists or standard treatment, but these may fall well short of enabling recovery, and long-term follow-up is rare. A human rights context, with reference to cultural difference in expressing distress and seeking help, and with reference to the personal meaning of torture, is essential as a basis for formulating treatment initiatives based on the evidence reviewed.Refugees with a history of torture may have a wide range of psychological and social difficulties which do not easily fit within diagnostic categories.Torture and its sequelae can have multiple meanings and, in the clinical context, it is the interpretation of the torture survivor that matters.There are doubts about applying the concept and measures of post-traumatic stress disorder: symptoms should be assessed separately.Current circumstances can be as important as trauma history in understanding the psychological state of a torture survivor.Cognitive behavioural therapy and narrative exposure therapy seem equally effective in reducing trauma symptoms, and to a lesser extent, depression.",

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Depression, a debilitating illness characterised by a persistent depressed mood that impairs normal function, exerts an enormous health and financial cost worldwide. Diagnosis of depression is complex, as not all people experience the same symptoms, with diagnosis based on a series of questions as no biological test is currently available. This is due to the fact that the causes of depression have yet to be fully elucidated, although development of depression appears to be dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. While there is no cure for depression, psychological, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches successfully manage the symptoms of many patients. However, there are patients that are refractive to current treatments, highlighting the need for improved diagnostics and therapeutics. For this, increased understanding of the neurobiology underlying depression is necessary, requiring further research utilising both animal models of depression and human clinical studies. Key Concepts The diagnosis of depression is complex, is based on the types and duration of the symptoms and is commonly complicated by the presence of comorbid conditions. While there is no cure for depression, symptoms of depression can be managed through a variety of cognitive, pharmacological and brain stimulation approaches. Depression is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Human imaging studies suggest that depression is correlated with activity changes in multiple brain regions. Animal models are necessary to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that lead to depression and to test novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Somatoform Dissociation",
      "abstract": "Abstract In most of the recent scientific and clinical literature, dissociation has been equated with dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, and fragmentation of identity. However, according to Pierre Janet and several World War I psychiatrists, dissociation also pertains to a lack of integration of somatoform components of experience, reactions, and functions. Some clinical observations and contemporary studies have supported this view. Somatoform dissociation, which can be measured with the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20), is highly characteristic of dissociative disorder patients, and a core feature in many patients with somatoform disorders and in a subgroup of patients with eating disorders. It is strongly associated with reported trauma among psychiatric patients and patients with chronic pelvic pain presenting in medical healthcare settings. Motor inhibitions and anesthesia/analgesia are somatoform dissociative symptoms that are similar to animal defensive reactions to major threat and injury. Among a wider range of somatoform dissociative symptoms, these particular symptoms are highly characteristic of patients with dissociative disorders. The empirical findings reviewed in this article should have implications for the contemporary conceptualization and definition of dissociation, as well as the categorization of somatoform disorders in a future version of the DSM.",

Sometimes these pains are called ‘idiopathic’ or ‘atypical’ or even of ‘psychological origin’. Included in these descriptions would be ‘atypical facial pain’, and perhaps the similar pain syndromes which present in the mouth and the perineal regions. The term ‘atypical pain’ is most unsatisfactory, as it really means nothing to any observer except to the person who originally coined the phrase for pain which seemed to be an atypical variant of some other recognized condition. To be preferred is the expression ‘idiopathic pain’ with its implication of a disorder of pain perception, or ‘pain of unknown aetiology’. The latter suffers from the disadvantage of being too wide a description.",

      "abstract": "A bstract Back pain is an unpleasant and disturbing experience in everyone’s life and is a common lifetime health disorder. Involvement of many spinal structures can be the cause of low back pain (LBP), which can lead to difficulty in identifying and diagnosing the cause precisely. There is uncertainty about the optimal approach and a wide variation in patient care, which has led to different beliefs that conservative management is effective and radiological investigation is unnecessary and vice versa. Systemic reviews have concluded that only 1% of the individual coming to primary care needs diagnostic imaging for serious pathology, and this will save individuals from labeling their diseases and not adding up psychological factors. This may also limit the overdiagnosis and over treatment approach. Retrolisthesis, one of the causative factors for LBP, is not common. Very few studies have been documented for physical therapy rehabilitation in retrolisthesis, and so far no new protocol emerged in chronic cases. People suffering usually have anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life. Apprehension of pain with avoidance of physical activity leads to secondary structural changes and recurrence of back pain. Physical therapy tailored to stretch and strengthening exercises is the most evidence-based treatment for retrolisthesis. This case report presents a unique case of the retrolisthesis which was not responding to conventional treatment of exercises and interestingly got dramatic results with a change in approach. This will give new dimensions to contemporary practice.",

Special features of childhood interpersonal trauma leading to the development of borderline personality disorder are the seriousness of the trauma and the fact that it is sexual in nature. Serious intrafamilial childhood abuse can lead not only to the classic post-traumatic stress syndrome, but can influence all aspects of personality development, including the distortion of the sense of identity, self-regulation, and the patterns of interpersonal relations. Viewed from the perspective of the trauma concept, the entire range of adult borderline symptoms are considered as being the consequences of severe complex traumatic experiences. Other clinicians regard such an abuse as a marker of the severity of familial dysfunction and emphasize the role of other pathogenic factors, such as biparental neglect and biological vulnerability of the pre-borderline child.",

Depression has a bi-directional causal relationship with physical disease, so each can be a risk factor for the other. Depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur more often than as separate conditions and are often undetected or diagnosed by primary and secondary healthcare staff. People who experience depression and physical illness understand depression as part of their whole life experience and not just as being simply related to their physical health. Depression, and to a lesser extent anxiety, in the context of physical disease are associated with a range of poor outcomes, including poorer physical health outcomes and quality of life; increased hospitalisations, investigations and healthcare costs; and higher mortality.",

      "title": "The potential of plasma exchange in treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and long <scp>COVID</scp>: Targeting autoimmune and inflammatory mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and long COVID have increasingly gained attention in both medical research and public discourse due to their profound impact on patients' quality of life and the frustrating lack of effective treatments. CFS is a debilitating condition characterized by extreme, unexplained fatigue that persists for at least 6 months and is not alleviated by rest.1 This condition often leads to a substantial reduction in daily activities, making it difficult for individuals to maintain work, social, and personal responsibilities. On the other hand, long COVID refers to the persistence of symptoms following the acute phase of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, with fatigue being one of the most common and distressing features. In addition to fatigue, long COVID patients often report a range of other symptoms such as brain fog, shortness of breath, joint pain, and autonomic disturbances, further complicating their recovery and daily functioning.2 The pathophysiology of both conditions remains poorly understood, with ongoing research attempting to unravel the underlying mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that immune dysfunction, endothelial injury, and autonomic dysregulation may play central roles in the development and persistence of symptoms in both CFS and long COVID.2, 3 These physiological abnormalities are thought to contribute to the chronic fatigue, cognitive impairments, and multisystem involvement observed in affected patients. Blood biomarkers such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, S100B, and P-selectin may show alterations in patients with long COVID or CFS; however, the specific biomarkers linked to symptoms and their roles in disease progression are not yet fully understood. Due to the absence of definitive biomarkers and a clear understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, treatment options are currently limited and primarily aimed at managing symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of these conditions. Given the multifaceted nature of these conditions, a treatment that targets immune, endothelial, and metabolic factors simultaneously may be required (Figure 1). TPE represents a novel and potentially promising therapeutic approach for CFS and long COVID, especially in patients who exhibit signs of immune dysregulation. By removing circulating autoantibodies, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and other factors that may contribute to the persistence of symptoms, TPE could help alleviate the chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction that are hallmarks of these conditions. This treatment holds potential for improving quality of life in patients who have not responded to conventional therapies. However, further research is critical to clarify its overall efficacy, determine which patients are most likely to benefit, and establish standardized treatment protocols that can guide its clinical use. Randomized controlled trials, such as the one initiated by Preßler H et al.,3 are essential to validate the role of TPE in the management of CFS and long COVID. These studies will provide the necessary evidence to incorporate TPE into a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for these challenging and often debilitating syndromes. Therefore, if apheresis treatment is employed for these conditions, it is crucial to publish the outcomes in the form of case reports or case series until more clinical trial evidence becomes available. The authors have disclosed no conflicts of interest.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Essential Tremor",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT PURPOSE OF REVIEW Essential tremor is a chronic, progressive syndrome that primarily presents with an action tremor involving the arms and hands. This article reviews the history and physical examination features pertinent for diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and treatments and approaches for optimal control of symptoms. RECENT FINDINGS Essential tremor is a syndrome with symptoms extending beyond tremor to involve disturbances in gait, speech, cognition, and mood. Although the new guidelines on the definition and biaxial classification scheme have provided clarity, some tremor experts have critiqued the recently coined term essential tremor plus . For treatment, new orthotic devices and peripheral stimulation devices are now available in addition to pharmacologic and surgical options. SUMMARY Essential tremor has a rich clinical phenomenology with many subtleties and nuances. A detailed history with open-ended questions and focused questions encompassing medical history, social history, and family history is key for establishing the diagnosis. The presence of bilateral action tremor for 3 years and absence of isolated head and voice tremor and absence of task- and position-dependent tremor are necessary for diagnosis. Dystonic tremor, Parkinson disease tremor, physiologic tremor, and drug-induced tremor are common differential diagnoses. Differentiating these tremor disorders from essential tremor based on phenomenology and physical examination alone could be challenging; thus, clinicians should seek additional clues from a detailed history. Treatment could begin with noninvasive and nonpharmacologic therapies, especially in mild cases. As the severity increases, they can advance stepwise to include pharmacotherapies and surgical interventions. With the growing recognition that essential tremor is not a monosymptomatic disorder, management should involve a multidisciplinary team. Furthermore, treatment selection should be based on shared decision making between patients and providers that gives due consideration to severity of symptoms, level of functional disability, impact on social interactions, patient preferences, and patient expectations.",

      "abstract": "Somatic symptoms are common presentations in health settings. They can manifest as symptoms of another underlying mental disorder or be termed as medically unexplained. When they are medically unexplained they are invariably subsumed under the diagnostic categories of somatoform disorders. They are associated with interference in functioning, poor quality of life and are burdensome on health resources. The measurement of these symptoms is essential for understanding the individual and planning treatment. There are various instruments that have somatic symptoms measurement in their items. The tools have included somatic symptoms measurement in measuring general psychopathology, somatic symptoms as part of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms specifically, and as a screening instrument for somatoform disorders. The advantages and disadvantages of common measures have been discussed. It appears that no one measure fulfils the essential criteria of an ideal measure for somatic symptoms. The measures of somatic symptoms should also be culturally sensitive and serve diagnostic, prognostic and heuristic purposes. These aspects are highlighted in the review.",

In the EEG, the SSR appears as a long-lasting potential of abrupt onset with a characteristic monophasic, biphasic, or triphasic morphology. It is recorded most commonly from the frontal head regions, but it may be more diffuse. The SSR may be elicited by mental activity, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, or the act of filling electrodes. Extracranial recording, usually obtained from electrodes on the palm of the hand, can be used to confirm the presence of an SSR suspected on scalp recording.",

      "abstract": "Los neonatos sufren innecesariamente dolor debido a lo complejo de la evaluación, la falta de entrenamiento de los profesionales, el temor a los efectos secundarios de las drogas y la clásica presunción que no lo sienten. Sin embargo, hoy día se infiere, por los indicadores del comportamiento y los fisiológicos, que el dolor está presente en ellos y debe prevenirse y tratarse para evitar el sufrimiento y los efectos nocivos debidos a los cambios fisiológicos, hormonales y biológicos que pueden “reprogramar” a largo plazo el desarrollo del sistema nervioso central. Los estudios realizados muestran que los niños no tratados debidamente para el dolor presentan dificultades en los procesos de aprendizaje, conducta, memoria, socialización, autorregulación y expresión de los sentimientos. El dolor se infiere por los parámetros de la conducta –llanto, expresión facial, respuestas motoras simples– y de la fisiología –cambios en las variables cardiorrespiratorias, sudoración palmar, liberación de catecolaminas. El tratamiento comprende, además de la asistencia humanizada, la buena técnica y los instrumentos más precisos, la terapia farmacológica con los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, los opioides, los anestésicos locales y los adyuvantes, y la terapia no farmacológica como la postura adecuada, las caricias, el arrullo, las imágenes agradables, la música, la estimulación táctil y el movimiento. Los investigadores tratan de definir la eficacia de las terapias no farmacológicas y su funcionamiento biológico; los efectos clínicos de la terapia farmacológica y el desarrollo de métodos analgésicos no invasivos para la liberación de drogas como la utilización del Yag Láser para alcanzar rápidamente el efecto de los anestésicos locales; la iontoforesis que permite la transferencia a los tejidos de moléculas cargadas de droga bajo la influencia de la electricidad; el uso de pequeños instrumentos como el Dermoeyector, el Bioeyector y similares que suministran la droga para la anestesia local o regional mediante el uso de gases comprimidos; la utilización de matrices o microesferas polimerizadas biodegradables que al colocarlas en sitios específicos como los nervios o plexos nerviosos liberan lentamente hasta por varios días la droga analgésica y anestésica, lo que permite el alivio prolongado del dolor; la colocación de parches para la aplicación transdérmica de drogas; la administración transtraqueal de opioides como el fentanil. En conclusión, es necesario concienciar acerca de que los neonatos experimentan dolor; que se tienen bases fisiológicas para evaluarlo y tratarlo y para disminuir su exposición a estímulos nocivos y minimizar los resultados adversos. Finalmente, se recomienda que las intervenciones sean efectivas y seguras en el alivio del dolor y el estrés.",

It may be either physical, mental or social anxiety. The most common causes of anxiety in dental patients is fear of injections, fear of choking or gagging and fear of blood. It can be shown as fear, anxiety, phobia, stress, shivering, sweating, crying during or before dental treatment. Sympathetic nervous system is activated during dental anxiety and there is provoke of fight or flight response. This causes changes in various physiological activities such as reduction in pain threshold, increase in treatment complications, post- treatment pain, late healing. Identifying anxiety in dental patient is the first and foremost step in determining the type of treatment and schedule of appointments. Progressive muscle relaxation is one such technique a where muscles and body are allowed to relax after they are tensed. Materials and methods: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google scholar was searched using pre-specified search strategy. Narrative and systematic reviews are included for the data synthesis. Results: Extensive literature search was carried out using pre-defined search strategy was carried out. A total of 73 titles were screened rigorously by two independent evaluators and after duplicate exclusion, removal of irrelevant titles, 34 articles were included for full text. This review aims at detailing progressive muscle relaxation technique, a non-pharmacological, economical approach to relieve dental anxiety.",

Somatically, the illness and treatment threaten physical integrity.\nCancer is an insidious disease, in which the patient is severely ill before he\nnotices any symptoms.

This means that the confidence the\npatient has in his own body is diminished.\nSocially, the illness, treatment and its consequences (tiredness, lack of energy,\nfeeling ill) may result in social isolation. This can be increased by the fear and\nuncertainty of by-standers how to approach the patient, what to say to him, and\nwhat to expect from him.\nPsychologically, the patient has to cope with the emotional consequences of the\nillness, such as changes in life perspective, mourning his lost health, and anxiety\nand uncertainty about the future.\nThe literature on the prevalence of psychological distress in cancer patients is\nequivocal. The percentages of depressed and/or anxious patients reported in the\nliterature vary widely from 0% to 49% (cf.

Symptoms can be mild and transient, but many people are troubled by severe symptoms that cause great personal distress, and which impair social and occupational function. The societal burden associated with anxiety disorders is considerable, but many who might benefit from treatment are not recognized or treated by healthcare professionals. By contrast, some patients receive unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. Recognition relies on keen awareness of the psychological and physical symptoms seen in all anxiety disorders, and accurate diagnosis rests on the identification of the specific features of particular disorders. The need for treatment is determined by the severity and persistence of symptoms, the level of associated disability and impact on everyday life, the presence of co-existing depressive symptoms, and other features such as a good response to or poor tolerability of previous treatment approaches. Choice of treatment is influenced by patient characteristics, patient and doctor preferences, and the local availability of potential interventions. There is much overlap between the different anxiety disorders for evidence-based and effective therapies (such as the prescription of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or a course of individual cognitive–behavioural therapy) but there are also important differences, so it helps to become familiar with the characteristic features and evidence base for each disorder.",

A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "abstract": "Collusion is a mostly unconscious phenomenon occurring in the therapeutic relationship, which can be commonly identified in psychiatry but more generally in medicine. Collusion is especially present in circumstances in which the effects of disease and its treatments have a heavy impact on patients and caregivers, and where the stakes are existential. Collusion is triggered by unresolved psychological problems, for example, loss, intimacy or control, which are shared by the patient and the clinician. Collusion, if unrecognized, can seriously hamper the clinician-patient relationship and the care of the patient.La collusion est un phénomène inconscient survenant dans la relation thérapeutique, observable en psychiatrie, mais aussi en médecine. Elle se manifeste surtout dans les domaines où les effets de la maladie et des traitements pèsent lourdement sur les patients et les cliniciens et où les enjeux sont existentiels. L’origine d’une collusion se situe dans des problèmes psychologiques non résolus, en lien avec des thématiques comme la perte, l’intimité ou le contrôle, qui sont partagés par le clinicien et son patient. La collusion, si elle n’est pas reconnue, peut sérieusement entraver la relation clinique et avoir des conséquences négatives sur la prise en charge.",

      "abstract": "Any stimulus (intrinsic or extrinsic) that triggers a biological response is known as stress. Stress can exert various negative effects on the body ranging from alterations in homeostasis to life-threatening effects and death. Erectile dysfunction can be a manifestation of chronic stress. ED is the most common male sexual dysfunction that affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. ED may result from many etiologic factors like psychogenic, endocrino- logic, neurogenic, arteriogenic or venoocclusive dysfunction. These factors are not mutually exclusive and multi- ple factors contribute to ED in many patients. According to modern science Psychogenic factors frequently coex- ist with other etiologic factors and should be considered in all cases. A patient aged 35 years came to the OPD of A&amp;U Tibbia college with complaints of inability to initiate and maintain erection along with abnormal vision, dizziness, retrosternal burning, indigestion, heaviness in chest and disinterest. He was advised for Shirodhara along with counselling (Satvvajaychikitsa) and after a couple of days, there was a significant improvement in pa- tient. In this case study, we are trying to highlight the contribution of stress &amp; psyche on male sexual dysfunction and its management through Satvavajaychikitsa (counselling) and Shirodhara.

      "abstract": "Most pains from the locomotor system arise due to involuntary, chronic tensions in the muscles or other tissues. When the patient is motivated, the pain is easily cured in most of the cases by using the tools of consciousness-based medicine, primarily therapeutic touch, conversation, and coaching the patient in a positive philosophy of life. The pains are often caused by “blockages” that may cause problems other than just pain. Often it turns out that the blocked areas develop actual physical damage over time: a slipped disk in the back, articular degeneration, or osteoarthritis when the cartilage is affected, can often be explained in this way. Apparently, the exact areas where the blockage is situated cause cellular problems, disrupting cellular order. The holistic process theory of healing and the related quality of life theories state that return to the natural state of being is possible, whenever the person gets the resources needed for existential healing. The resources needed are “holding” in the dimensions of awareness, respect, care, acknowledgment, and acceptance with support and processing in the dimensions of feeling, understanding, and letting go of negative attitudes and beliefs. The preconditions for holistic healing are trust and the intention for the healing to take place. Case stories of holistic treatment of patients with chronic back pain, low back pain, muscle problems, knee pain, and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are discussed with exercises relevant for patients with these conditions in the holistic clinic.",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "Hypochondriasis (Health Anxiety) Reformulated: Similarities With Generalized Anxiety Disorder in A Routine Setting Single Case",
      "abstract": "Despite its long documented history, Hypochondriasis remains a ubiquitous enigma to virtually all health care disciplines and providers. Because such highly health anxious patients are not commonly open to psychological (i.e., non-medical) interpretations of their physiological symptoms, sufferers ironically often become fixed on a pathological quest for physical and/or medical explanations for their problems. This pervasive worry and worry-based behavioral pattern perpetuates and reifies the belief that one hasor will developa serious medical condition, and, due to its inappropriate fixity on perceived organic (versus psychic) etiology, leaves such excessive doubt largely untreated. Therefore, continual high medical utilization and costs persist, and profound human suffering goes largely unchecked and unmanaged. Collectively, this sad, but very real condition and circumstance is unacceptable. Fortunately, this oft recalcitrant and thorny phenomenon has recently been construed as perhaps being similar to another such condition, namely Generalized Anxiety Disorder. If this resemblance is more than a surface relationship, and the two phenomena are indeed related on a process level (i.e., the two share a common pathological core), then Hypochondriasis should be treatable via a specifically tailored treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Since Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been far more responsive to intervention than Hypochondriasis, as its central mechanism of pathology is now well understood (i.e., intolerance for uncertainty), it would be conceivable that Hypochondriasis is in actuality far more treatable than its current riddle-status would otherwise suggest. Indeed, if the two prove to be quite similar, if not outright forms of one another, then there would be far more hope that patients who suffer with this can be helped. This stirring hypothesis was tested by treating a particularly refractory, chronic and severe case of Hypochondriasis with a specialized Generalized Anxiety Disorder treatment package. “Joe” responded quite favorably to treatment, and obtained meaningful change according to Jacobson and Truax’s (1991) method for determining clinically significantand reliablechange. In fact, according to their most restrictive standard, Joe could be labeled “Recovered” at the end of treatment, and at all 18-month follow-up points. His response, caveated around single case generalizability limitations, suggested that perhaps Hypochondriasis does indeed share a common etiological source, namely intolerance for uncertainty, with Generalized Anxiety Disorder; if so, then that would be highly explanative of the strong results. Recommendations are given for conceptualizing pathological forms of health-related fears as just that, a concrete form of an anxiety disorder rather than a Somatoform condition.

      "title": "Efecto de las crisis epilépticas refractarias sobre los procesos cognitivos",
      "abstract": "A complete definition of all risk factors for intractability and/or mental retardation cannot currently be given because epilepsy is not a disease but a heterogeneous phenomenon from the physiological, clinical and etiological points of view so that no single way of addressing the issue can fit all situations. It is quite possible that some risk factors can be specific for subgroups and do not apply to the majority of cases. Such subgroups may be small enough to escape detection in large prospective studies that uniformly indict a limited number of factors mostly related to characteristics of the disease or patients. Yet, even factors that are at play only in small groups may be extremely important if they can be at the origin of effective preventive measures. This may well be the case for vigorous early treatment of complex febrile seizures as there is increasing evidence of a close, probably causal, relationship between lengthy early convulsions and mesial temporal sclerosis. It may also apply to the prevention of cognitive/behavioural deterioration in children with certain types of epilepsy even though the evidence in this regard is less strong. Exonerating seizures and/or subclinical paroxysmal activity of any responsibility in the production and/or aggravation of brain damage is not justified on the basis of known facts and vigorous although reasonable treatment of the epilepsies may do more, at least in certain forms, than simply decreasing the relapse rate of seizures",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONBruxism is psychopathophysiological disorder of orofacial muscle activity which is defined by American Academy of Orofacial Pain as a diurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.1 The excessive and frequent nocturnal bruxist activity, unlike physiological muscular activity during sleep, results in non-physiological wear (attrition) of occlusal surfaces.2,3In multifactorial and often controversial bruxism etiology, peripheral (morphological) and central (physchological and pathophysiological) etiological factors can be distinguished.4 The most common morphological factors, such as occlusion (in particular occlusal discrepancies), along with the anatomy of the orofacial system have been considered more traditional than evidence based medicine and dentistry bruxism causative factors.4,5Bruxism is related to great number of pathophysiological factors. During sleep, sudden awakening or change in intensity of sleep may occur. That is arousal response. Then, generalized change of body activity occurs: higher heart rate, changes in breathing rhythm, peripheral vasoconstriction and muscular hyperactivity, including bruxism.6 Changes of the central neurotransmitter system in the nigrostriatal projection can cause the muscular activity disorders. Drug therapy can also induce bruxism: L-dopa, neuroleptics and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Numerous substances such as amphetamines, amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol can play major role in the etiology of bruxism, which has been particularly explained by effects via dopamine system.7Behavioral disorders and affective psychological factors, anxiety being one of the most prominent together with emotional stress, caused by sociological and psychological factors, can induce bruxism.8Dentistry and alcohol consumingAlcoholism is progressive mental disease with social and health consequences. The addiction to alcohol is more difficult to observe in early stages of alcoholism due to some traditional reasons related to alcohol consuming, which can have adverse side effects in dental treatment. Alcohol consumption leads to great number of systemic disorders, such as malnutrition and hypovitaminosis, neurological disorders, pathological changes in the digestive, cardiovascular and respiratory system.9,10Besides the poor oral hygiene, consumption of alcohol may cause oral diseases, periodontal diseases and premature tooth loss. Alcoholics are exposed to higher risk of orofacial trauma (for example, jaw fractures), fractures and even losing the removable dentures while under the influence of alcohol.11The aim of this paper is to give case report on Michigan splint treatment of very severe bruxism in female patient who was under psychiatric therapy due to alcohol consuming, which caused psychoorganic syndrome.CASE REPORTA previously treated 62 year old psychiatric female patient was referred to the Prosthodontic Department, School of Dental Medicine, University of Zagreb for prosthodontic treatment. She exhibited pronounced teeth abrasion.Psychiatric treatmentTaking her case history with the assistance of her son and from the available medical records of her previous psychiatric treatments, we found out that she had been an alcoholic for many years (F 10.2 diagnosis by the International Classification of Diseases - ICD) and subsequently developed pyschoorganic syndrome with characteristics of depression (F 10.7 diagnosis by the ICD). Although she has had the alcohol addiction problem for many years, her psychiatric treatment started in 2001. She was hospitalized for three months at the alcoholism ward and discharged in better health condition with recommendation to take 20 mg of fluoxetine in the morning and 3x5 mg of diazepam. In the same year, she was coming regularly for check-up in the Psychiatric patient clinic accompanied by her son who reported her abstinence from alcohol, but also less communication and more passiveness in behavior. …",

      "abstract": "Chronic pain, which is widespread worldwide, has negative physical and psychological effects and can cause serious decreases in quality of life. There are various types of chronic pain such as musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, head-facial pain and it is caused by different factors. However, it is one of the issues that should be taken into consideration that chronic pain that manifests itself on the body is not only caused by biological reasons, but may also have a psychological background. In this context, there is a lot of evidence that psychological trauma plays an important role in the onset of chronic pain by increasing pain sensitivity and severity. In the light of this information, how different types of trauma such as ‘psychological trauma’, ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’, ‘childhood traumas’ affect chronic pain has been mentioned in detail. In addition, emotional factors also play a role in chronic pain, and even pain and emotions share a common neurobiology. Research findings on how the relationship between different types of emotions and chronic pain has been revealed. In the literature, there are many studies on the connection of emotions and psychological trauma history with the body. However, especially in Turkey, studies examining these variables in chronic pain are insufficient and it is thought that more research is needed. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to review the existing theories and research on the relationship between chronic pain, trauma and emotions.",

This is particularly true of the emotional state which may develop in persons who find themselves in a hazardous situation. For present purposes this emotional state is termed anxiety, although it is recognized that other reactions such as resentment or anger may also occur, depending upon the individual and the circumstances. In any study on unanesthetized human subjects, changes produced by anxiety may mask completely the physiologic or pharmacologic effects which are obvious in a relaxed subject. In the interpretation of experimental data. objective criteria by which it can be established, or even suspected, that anxiety is having an effect on cardiovascular function are useful.

Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of the mental illness, perhaps even inducing psychosis. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and possible incarceration. All of these factors contribute to a greater health burden, which reduces the health care system's capacity to adequately treat patients. Therefore, screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis that can address both the addiction disorder and the mental illness are recommended in order to provide accurate treatment, after-care, and other health care to accommodate patients' social and vocational needs.",

Swearing and coprolalia thus have been likened as two ends of a continuum. Both occur apparently automatically, are triggered by emotional activation, e. g., by stress or pain, and are typically instantiations of nonpropositional language. Neurobiologically, a thalamo-cortical-limbic dysfunction is discussed. However, there are notable differences between the two: While swearing fulfills intra- and inter-individual functions coprolalia seems less functional and can result in considerable social stigma because of their occurrence in socially inappropriate situations. Patients with coprolalia report antecedents, especially feelings of urge and premonitory sensations, like itches or tingles. Finally, coprolalia seems to extend to more serious and insulting expressions compared to “everyday” swearwords.",

These psycho-behavioral manifestations can be isolated, coexist, or complicate a neurological deficit, thus raising questions about their imputability. Our goal is to shed light on the extent to which cranial traumas contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders and their specific characteristics. Ultimately, we aim to establish the foundations for an optimal biopsychosocial and legislative management approach if necessary. This will be illustrated through the clinical case of a patient who exhibited depressive symptoms shortly after the onset of delusional ideas with a psychotic nature, one year after experiencing a cranial trauma due to a public road accident. The somatic consequences of cranial trauma can cause psychotic symptoms. This is referred to as a post-traumatic psychotic disorder directly linked to localized brain damage, adhering to the structure-function paradigm. Such symptoms can appear up to four years later. The authors have reported that the onset of psychotic symptoms is frequently associated with depressive syndrome, which is a factor contributing to the chronicization of post-traumatic psychosis. Psychotic symptoms following Psychotic manifestations, such as delusions and hallucinations, can occur in various psychiatric and somatic disorders, especially neurological and neurosurgical conditions. These behaviors can occur alone, work in conjunction, or complicate a neurological deficit, raising questions about their connection to the condition.

Polysomnography, motor activity monitoring of rest-activity cycles, plasma melatonin profiles and urinary melatonin metabolite excretion are normal. Different patterns of sleep phase delay seen in the syndrome include stable, progressive, irregular and non-24 hour sleep-wake cycles. These patterns may result from different social and other Zeitgebers (\"time-markers\", for example sunrise, sunset) in the normal environment.

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is conceptualized as an excessive and/or unreasonable fear of situations in which the person’s behavior or appearance might be scrutinized and evaluated. This fear is a consequence of the person’s expectation to be judged negatively, which might lead to embarrassment or humiliation. Typical examples of feared and usually avoided social situations are giving a talk in public, performing other tasks in front of others, and interacting with people in general. Although the existence of SAD as a psychopathological entity has been known for at least 100 years, it was only relatively recently, with the publication of DSM-III in 1980, that SAD (or social phobia) acquired the status of an ‘‘official’’ psychiatric diagnosis. The term social anxiety disorder has been increasingly used instead of social phobia, because it is felt that the use of the former term conveys more strongly the pervasiveness and impairment associated with the condition and that this term will promote better recognition of the disorder and contribute to better differentiation from specific phobia (Liebowitz et al., 2000). Like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder is common and controversial. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, which is described in different ways by different diagnostic criteria and different researchers and clinicians, SAD does not suffer from a ‘‘description problem.’’ It is not particularly difficult to recognize features of SAD; what may be difficult is making sense of these features. Main issues associated with SAD are listed below…. 1. Where are the boundaries of SAD? How well is SAD distinguished from ‘‘normal’’ social anxiety and shyness on one hand, and from severe psychopathology on the other? 2. Is there a danger of ‘‘pathologizing’’ intense social anxiety by labeling it a psychiatric disorder? How can the distress and suffering of people with high levels of social anxiety be acknowledged if they are not given the corresponding diagnostic label? 3. Is SAD a bona fide mental disorder? 4. Can the subtyping scheme (nongeneralized vs. generalized SAD) be supported? 5. Is there a spectrum of social anxiety disorders?",

      "abstract": "Physical manifestations vary from subject to subject as well as genetic risk factors when considering traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and recovery. Clinical and behavioral findings may resemble autism that appear with limited mobility and the physical experience may impact treatment. Ataxia, weakness, hemiplegia, hemiparesis are among them. Novel therapy uncovered physical correlations between subject's presentation and physicality with relief and progress when movement and sound are present and monitored during a case study of an adult male with acute head injury from blunt force trauma reported previously. Namely, the release of soft tissue trigger points relieves stress held in the regions affected through soft tissue trigger points stimuli. The occipital attachments for the extensor muscles and positive responses were noted with the stimulation of these regions with effleurage or cross fiber friction and stripping. Vertigo or nausea affecting equilibrium might present as physical displays of deviations of the ability to control balance. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo or BPPV, vestibular migraines or Broca’s aphasia, are among other presentations affecting one's balance and need to be considered during treatment. Challenging desensitization or flooding and habituation with compensatory strategies are required to maintain safety and autonomy of daily living ADL while providing relief when other therapies fall short. One must not underestimate the commitment needed during pre-diagnosis or when diagnosing a disability of head injury by evaluating for other risk factors. This may include advanced genetic testing for potential genes that may contribute to brain injury and recovery. Brain imaging may also be required to assess the location and severity that may impact treatment approaches and recovery responses.",

      "title": "Exercise as Therapy for Depression: A Review of the Positive Psychosocial and Psychobiological Effects of Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Depression has been conceptualized in two separate ways. Some define the phenomenon by a unique array of psychological abnormalities (a social and behavioural profile). On the other hand, depression can also be described as a quantifiable diseased state of the brain that may be cured using a biological therapy or pharmaceutical. Neither one of these definitions is incorrect; rather, they each describe different aspects of this form of mental illness. This duality inherent to understanding depression makes light of the sparse assemblage of literature that exists concerning such a socially, psychologically, and biologically complex phenomenon. Research has shown that the therapeutic benefits of exercise offer treatment for both the psychosocial and biological effects of depression. A more unified research perspective that looks for a coincidence of the social with the biological may allow for steps forward in understanding mental illness and disease.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Human consciousness, the awareness of oneself and one’s environment, is an artificial construction. In a normal state of consciousness, the brain seamlessly integrates sensory perceptions, emotional states, current thoughts, and past memories. The essential feature of the various dissociative disorders is that these elements have become disrupted, dissociated, from each other. The distinctions between the different types of dissociative disorders are based on which particular aspect of subjective experience has become dissociated from the others. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by dissociation of memory. The affected individual demonstrates an inability to recall important biographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. The memory deficit is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forget-fulness. Dissociative fugue is characterized by an even greater dissociation of memory, such that the individual dissociates not only key historical information but also his own sense of identity. Affected individuals may engage in sudden, unexpected travel away from their homes or customary places of work, accompanied by an inability to recall their past, confusion about their personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity.",

      "abstract": "Difficulty in concentration is a common functional symptom, and students suffering from a variety of psychiatric conditions are liable to come to the Health Service with study difficulty as their presenting complaint. It then becomes necessary to determine whether this symptom is indeed secondary to some other problem of a situational, developmental, or psychiatric nature, or whether any associated emotional distress is secondary to study difficulties deriving from poor study habits. In this paper a pragmatic distinction has been made between Primary Study Difficulty and Secondary Study Difficulty, and between various subcategories of the latter. Useful as such a classification may be it remains, like most classifications, somewhat arbitrary and artificial. In any given case it is usually possible to relate a student's presenting complaints to a variety of factors, and to discern a subtle intertwining of cognitive and emotional determinants. The diagnostic and remedial needs of students with such problems are therefore best served by a clinic which involves psychiatrists and psychologists working in close collaboration.",

The legal history of criminal intent and insanity is reviewed. A case of indecent exposure is discussed in a man with a history of closed head injuries and sleepwalking disorder who was found standing naked in the middle of a busy urban thoroughfare in the wee hours of the morning and arrested. On psychiatric evaluation, the defendant was found to have a long-standing sleepwalking disorder. AT trial, scientific literature and psychiatric expert testimony concerning sleepwalking disorder was presented. The psychiatrist opined that the defendant was probably sleepwalking at the time of the alleged offense. No rebuttal testimony was offered by the prosecution. The jury found the man not guilty. The author surveys the legal history of sleepwalking disorder and compares this example with others in which uncontrolled behavior during sleep has resulted in harm to the patient or to others. Clinical and forensic implications of the disorder are reviewed. The parasomnias' impact on forensic practice should be systematically studied. Intervention strategies should be refined and implemented.",

Its multifactorial dynamics can include aspects of the illness itself, such as anosognosia. Noncompliance with medication can increase risk of violent or other criminal behavior, but the law currently does not recognize it as a factor in determining culpability. The legal test of insanity that focuses on a “defect of reason from disease of the mind” presumes that the disease was not self-induced.

A psychotic condition may be the basis of an excuse, whereas simple intoxication is not. The distinction is not only the obvious one of acts of omission (medication noncompliance) and acts of commission (voluntary intoxication). There are other complicating factors, such as the knowledge of the effects of noncompliance, the mental state prior to the noncompliance, and the presence of any conditions that would excuse or justify it.

However, it can considerably reduce motivation to the treatment, overcoming the illness, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and in general worsen the quality of their life. Manifestations of the depressed mood of cancer patients are similar to manifestations of the depressed mood of the patients having chronic or deadly diseases. However, there are features which depend on some factors, the most important of which is the disease stage. The results obtained allow to draw a conclusion that the features of the depressed mood at the second stage of the disease are connected with acceptation of the diagnosis and can manifest in the feeling of a punishment expectation, loss of interests in previous hobbies and communication restrictions; the features of a depressed mood at the third stage are determined by the disease dynamics and the further forecast, and can manifest in the analysis of the previous mistakes, absence of of hopes for the future, disgust for themselves and feeling of uselessness.",

Exposure to emotional abuse significantly affects mental health across the lifespan and is particularly associated with elevated depression risk.This review examinesmechanisms, by which emotional abuse influences brain development and the neuroendocrine stress response system and discusses the roles of genetic vulnerability and epigenetic processes in contributing to an elevated mental health risk. Emotional abuse has similar effects on brain networks responsible for emotion processing and regulation as other maltreatment types.Moreover, it uniquely affects networks related to self-relevant information and socio-cognitive processes. Furthermore, emotional abuse is associated with an impaired recovery of the neuroendocrine response to acute stress. Similar to other maltreatment types, emotional abuse is associated with epigenetic changes in genes regulating the neuroendocrine stress response system that are implicated in increased mental health risk.These findings suggest that emotional abuse has equally detrimental effects on children'smental health as physical or sexual abuse, warranting broader societal awareness and enhanced early detection efforts. Early interventions should prioritize emotion regulation, social cognition, self-esteemenhancement, and relationship- oriented approaches for victims of emotional abuse.",

To understand the reasons behind such high somatization prevalence rate in this part of the world, factors such as the meaning of disease symptoms, upbringing styles, gender roles, divorce, stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, symbolic language, trauma, and migration that affect somatization in the culture in which patients are raised need to be taken into consideration. It is likely that the physical complaints in somatization have a communicative function peculiar to particular societies that goes beyond the standard meanings attributable to body language. They may also be a silent cry for help, a reflection of traumas, a sign of a need for support, and sometimes an expression of difficulty in adapting to a new environment.",

Effective treatment always depends on making as precise a diagnosis as possible (e.g. pharmacological management of nausea and vomiting is guided by the presumed mechanism). Symptoms can also herald an emergency (e.g. sepsis, delirium, spinal cord compression), when the patient’s frailty, likely prognosis, and own values and wishes need to be taken into account in planning management.

It occurs in similar proportions in all cultures, interferes with quality of life and work performance, and is the most common reason for medical consultations. Few cases of back pain are due to specific causes; most cases are non-specific. Acute back pain is the most common presentation and is usually self-limiting, lasting less than three months regardless of treatment. Chronic back pain is a more difficult problem, which often has strong psychological overlay: work dissatisfaction, boredom, and a generous compensation system contribute to it. Among the diagnoses offered for chronic pain is fibromyalgia, an urban condition (the diagnosis is not made in rural settings) that does not differ materially from other instances of widespread chronic pain. Although disc protrusions detected on X-ray are often blamed, they rarely are responsible for the pain, and surgery is seldom successful at alleviating it. No single treatment is superior to others; patients prefer manipulative therapy, but studies have not demonstrated that it has any superiority over others. A WHO Advisory Panel has defined common outcome measures to be used to judge the efficacy of treatments for studies.",

      "title": "Signs of fatigue and fatigue, their causes and prevention",
      "abstract": "Relevance. Nowadays, the problem of fatigue and fatigue is very relevant. A person works and rests, but constant stress at work can cause fatigue and reduce the body's working capacity. Fatigue is a natural reaction of the body to intense activity and can lead to a deterioration in the quality of work. The efficiency of the body also decreases with increased fatigue. The purpose of the research is to examine the signs of fatigue and fatigue and determine whether fatigue is a normal reaction to stress or a consequence of a stress reaction to excessive stress. Methods and organization of research. The article provides a literary review of the causes and methods of preventing fatigue and fatigue. Conclusions. Fatigue and fatigue can be normal reactions of the body to physical or mental stress, lack of sleep or improper nutrition. However, they can also be signs of various diseases. The article considered the ways to prevent fatigue and fatigue, identified on the basis of various studies. By following these recommendations, you can reduce the risk of fatigue and fatigue and maintain high work efficiency and energy throughout the day.",

      "title": "Color synesthesia. Insight into perception, emotion, and consciousness",
      "abstract": "Synesthesia is an extraordinary perceptual phenomenon, in which individuals experience unusual percepts elicited by the activation of an unrelated sensory modality or by a cognitive process. Emotional reactions are commonly associated. The condition prompted philosophical debates on the nature of perception and impacted the course of art history. It recently generated a considerable interest among neuroscientists, but its clinical significance apparently remains underevaluated. This review focuses on the recent studies regarding variants of color synesthesia, the commonest form of the condition.Synesthesia is commonly classified as developmental and acquired. Developmental forms predispose to changes in primary sensory processing and cognitive functions, usually with better performances in certain aspects and worse in others, and to heightened creativity. Acquired forms of synesthesia commonly arise from drug ingestion or neurological disorders, including thalamic lesions and sensory deprivation (e.g., blindness). Cerebral exploration using structural and functional imaging has demonstrated distinct patterns in cortical activation and brain connectivity for controls and synesthetes. Artworks of affected painters are most illustrative of the nature of synesthetic experiences.Results of the recent investigations on synesthesia offered a remarkable insight into the mechanisms of perception, emotion and consciousness, and deserve attention both from neuroscientists and from clinicians.",

One such problem involves social skills deficits, through which depressed people communicate sadness and withdrawal to others. Another common problem is interpersonal rejection from others that is thought to be preceded by excessive reassurance seeking and emotional contagion. Finally, depression is often associated with problematic family relationships. These include marital distress, dysfunctional parenting behaviors by depressed mothers and fathers, and corrosive parenting practices enacted on children who go on to develop depression late in life. Theories built around these interpersonal constructs identify interpersonal problems as causes, consequences, maintaining forces, and vulnerabilities to depression.",

      "abstract": "This review examines acute and chronic whiplash-associated disorders to facilitate assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for further research and evidence-based practices.A review of the literature.Whiplash-associated disorders account for a large proportion of the overall impairment and disability caused by traffic injuries. Rarely can a definite injury be determined in the acute (or chronic) phase. Crash-related factors have been identified, and several trauma mechanisms possibly causing different injuries have been described. Most whiplash trauma will not cause injury, and the majority of patients (92-95%) will return to work. Litigation is not a major factor. Cognitive impairments are not the same as brain injury. Variables such as pain intensity, restricted motion, neurological symptoms and signs, together with central nervous system symptoms can be used to predict a situation with risk of remaining complaints. Influences of other factors--the same as for other chronic pain conditions--also exist. Persistent/chronic pain is not merely acute pain that persists over time; changes occur at different levels of the pain transmission system. Chronic whiplash-associated disorders are associated with problems concerning social functioning, daily anxieties and satisfaction with different aspects of life. Adequate information, advice and pain medication together with active interventions might be more effective in the acute stage. Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation focusing on cognitive-behavioural changes might be of value. To develop specific treatment and rehabilitation, it is important to identify homogenous subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder causes significant suffering and serious impairment in psychosocial functions. However, this disease with dangerous risks is scarcely mentioned in the Hungarian medical literature. The objective of the author is to give a detailed review about this almost unknown, but relatively common disorder. The serious disorder of body perception is in the centre of symptoms, leading to social isolation, anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive phenomena. The disorder often remains unrecognized because of the lack of insight of disease. Comorbidity with affective disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, eating disorders, alcoholism and substance use disorders is common. The life quality of affected patients is bad, the risk of suicide or violence is high. Biological, psychological and sociocultural factors play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder. Imaging techniques and neuropsychological measures revealed changes characteristic for the disease. Childhood abuse and neglect, appearance-related critical remarks, stressors and the impact of media are also supposed to have role in the development of the disorder. The point prevalence is 0.7-2.5% in the general population, however, in special groups such as in tertiary students, psychiatric, dermatological and cosmetic surgery patients the prevalence rates may be much higher. Typically, the disease begins in early adolescence, and it persists and deteriorates without treatment, showing a chronic course. By means of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy long-during improvement or full recovery can be achieved within a relatively short period of time.",

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease, Religious Belief and Spirituality",
      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "title": "GENDER DIFFERENCES IN COPING AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS",
      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common arthritic disease, occurs as part of the normal aging process. Common symptoms of OA include pain, tenderness, stiffness, loss of flexibility, and reduced mobility. Additionally, people with OA experience higher incidences of depressive symptoms, mood disturbance, and lower health status than the general population. Women have OA more often than men, and there are known gender differences in the way in which men and women experience OA pain. Women have lower thresholds for pain and rate the same stimuli as more painful than men. The relationships among depression, mood disturbance, and pain may be different for women than for men. People with OA experience psychological distress, impairment in physical functioning, physical disability, and therefore lower levels of health status than the general population, and this disability may be more prominent for women. Findings regarding gender differences in coping with OA pain have been inconsistent. Self-efficacy, or a person's belief that he or she can succeed in certain situations, is related to the type of coping an individual uses. There is evidence of gender differences in self-efficacy; however, no studies have examined whether these differences exist in older adults with OA. This thesis was designed to determine whether self-efficacy and coping mediate the relationship between OA and physical and psychological outcomes, and to determine whether the relationships among these variables differ as a function of gender. Additionally, the impact of perceived control as a moderator of coping was examined. It was hypothesized that 1) Participants with higher self-efficacy would engage in more problem-focused and less emotion-focused coping than individuals with lower self-efficacy. In turn, individuals who engaged in more problem-solving and meaning-focused coping and less emotion-focused coping would have higher levels of health status and lower levels of depression than those who engaged in less problem-focused coping and meaning-focused coping and more emotion-focused coping styles, 2) Individuals with high levels of perceived control would engage in more problem-focused coping and less emotion-focused coping than those with low levels of perceived control. Individuals with low levels of perceived control would engage in more emotion-focused coping and less problem-focused coping and 3) The hypothesized relationships would differ between males and females. Participants included 363 Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) members (233 women and 130 men) from a larger intervention study involving social support, education, or a combination of both. Coping was measured using the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC). Self-efficacy was measured using Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale. Control was measured using the helplessness subscale from the Arthritis Helplessness Index (AHI). Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Mood disturbance was assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS).…",

CONCLUSION Frontotemporal dementia, formerly known as Pick disease, is a primary degenerative dementia for which no cause is clearly established. Family history or genetic abnormalities are found in about 50% of cases. The diagnosis is frequently missed or delayed, as in this case, because it occurs in a younger age group, presents with unusual signs and symptoms, and is far less prevalent than Alzheimer disease.",

      "abstract": "A hypothesis raised in the first edition of this book, that psychotic symptoms often originate in traumatic experiences and relate to dissociation, is updated and expanded in this chapter. Evidence now demonstrates that traumatic experiences clearly may be linked to psychotic symptoms, and dissociation predicts not only voice hearing, but other forms of hallucinations and delusions as well. Strongly linked to dissociation are the so-called first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly passivity experiences such as believing that one’s thoughts, feelings, or actions are not under one’s own control. Traumatic, dissociation and, to a lesser extent, attachment-based explanations for psychotic symptoms are proposed. It is argued that psychotic symptoms are substantially overemphasized in the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, leading to a high likelihood of misdiagnosing dissociative disorders as schizophrenia, with the accompanying risks of stigma and inappropriate forms of treatment. This is particularly concerning as there is anecdotal evidence that antipsychotic medications are even less effective and more dangerous for dissociative disorders than for psychotic disorders, while trauma and dissociation-based treatments have demonstrated efficacy for psychotic symptoms. Thus, the traumatic and dissociative nature of some, if not most, psychotic symptoms should, for theoretical, clinical and ethical reasons, finally be acknowledged.",

      "abstract": "The functional esophageal disorders include globus, rumination syndrome, and symptoms that typify esophageal diseases (chest pain, heartburn, and dysphagia). Factors responsible for symptom production are poorly understood. The criteria for diagnosis rest not only on compatible symptoms but also on exclusion of structural and metabolic disorders that might mimic the functional disorders. Additionally, a functional diagnosis is precluded by the presence of a pathology-based motor disorder or pathological reflux, defined by evidence of reflux esophagitis or abnormal acid exposure time during ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Management is largely empirical, although efficacy of psychopharmacological agents and psychological or behavioral approaches has been established for serveral of the functional esophageal disorders. As gastroesophageal reflux disease overlaps in presentation with most of these disorders and because symptoms are at least partially provoked by acid reflux events in many patients, antireflux therapy also plays an important role both in diagnosis and management. Further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for symptoms is a priority for future research efforts, as is the consideration of treatment outcome in a broader sense than reduction in esophageal symptoms alone. Likewise, the value of inclusive rather than restrictive diagnostic criteria that encompass other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms should be examined to improve the accuracy of symptom-based criteria and reduce the dependence on objective testing.",

Data sources MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included CTE, dementia pugilistica, punch drunk syndrome, traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, repetitive head injury, sports concussion, multiple concussions, chronic concussions, subconcussive blow and sports-related traumatic brain injury. Results At present, there are no published epidemiological, cross-sectional or prospective studies relating to modern CTE. Owing to the nature of the published studies, being case reports or pathological case series, it is not possible to determine the causality or risk factors with any certainty. As such, the speculation that repeated concussion or subconcussive impacts cause CTE remains unproven. The extent to which age-related changes, psychiatric or mental health illness, alcohol/drug use or coexisting dementing illnesses contribute to this process is largely unaccounted for in the published literature. Conclusions At present, the interpretation of causation in the modern CTE case studies should proceed cautiously. The causal assumptions require further prospective or longitudinal studies on the topic.",

      "title": "Narcolepsy as a Type of Response to Emotional Conflicts",
      "abstract": "A careful analysis of the personal histories of patients showing the clinical syndrome of idiopathic narcolepsy indicates that this condition is a personality reaction to emotional issues, rather than an organic disease as has formerly been assumed. The symptoms of excessive diurnal sleep, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, somnambulism, nocturnal hallucinations and frightening dreams, which occur singly or in combination, appear to be neurotic defenses, with symbolic significance, against primary anxieties associated with difficulties in realistic adjustments in personal relationships with others. The narcoleptic syndrome as a neurotic reaction seems similar in many respects to the hysterical reaction. Patients showing the narcoleptic syndrome have in common a characteristic background of emotional conflict. They feel caught in a life-pattern to which they are expected to conform, but which they deeply resent. They become motivated by a need for autonomy and for self-differentiation along the lines of some alternative life-pattern of their own choosing. They are frustrated in their efforts to achieve this, because of the actual psychological ties which bind them to the life-pattern which they feel impelled to reject. In the tensions of the resulting emotional dilemma, the narcoleptic symptoms appear. As a result, a realistic showdown, with its associated anxieties, is avoided, and a substitute and more acceptable source of concern is provided. In our experience, these patients have proved responsive to psychotherapy which should provide a fundamental approach to their difficulty.",

The symptom complex of tetany is now less common than in former times when rachitic tetany was the most frequent cause of convulsions in infancy. It was well described in the older literature. The manifestations consist of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms, irritability often alternating with lethargy, nystagmus and strabismus, contractions and pain in the muscles of the face with \"half moon eyes,\" \"carp mouth,\" trismus and convulsions Edema, most marked in the hands, feet and around the eyes is often observed. Confirmatory signs of tetany may be elicited by special methods of examination. Chvostek's sign, jerking of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is tapped, is a sign of tetany in children from one month to two years of age. It is unreliable in newborn infants, in older children and adults since in them it may be present normally. When the facial muscles are in spasm with manifest tetany it can seldom be elicited. The peroneal sign consists of dorsiflexion and abduction of the foot on tapping the peroneal nerve on the lateral surface of the fibula just before the knee. Trousseau's sign is carpopedal spasm induced by pressure applied for some time over the upper arm or leg. Erb's sign, or increased electrical excitability of the peripheral nerves to the galvanic current, was the most reliable proof of tetany in the days before blood chemical analyses were available. The procurement of electrical reactions is such a time consuming procedure that they are seldom sought for now.",

This case discusses the appropriate approach to assessing a patient with facial weakness, which can be surprisingly challenging. In many instances, the patient, family or other witnesses, and even healthcare providers mistakenly identify which part of the face or even side of the face is weak. Clarifying the localization of facial weakness extends to much more than just looking at the pattern of facial weakness (forehead involvement or sparing) on exam. Ancillary exam testing can solidify the diagnosis of a central versus peripheral etiology of the weakness.",

Usually, the synkinesis is operative in only one way. For instance, in Bell's phenomenon the closure of the eyelids is accompanied by an upturning of the eyeball, not vice versa. Such associated movements have been recognized as expressions of reflex and coordinative mechanisms within the central nervous system. The unnatural appearance of an unwilled contraction of a muscle when another muscle is called into action has intrigued clinicians and has provoked much thought and speculation. Sometimes such pathologic synkineses have been noted early in life or have not been associated with any history or evidence of disease or trauma. These have been assumed to be congenital or even hereditary in origin. Most times, the associated movements have occurred with a",

      "abstract": "KUGATHASANDepression is a widespread illness that affects people regardless of age, nationality, race, and gender.Nearly everyone has feelings of blue moods at some point in their lives.It is when these feelings persist, recur, or become severe that one may be experiencing depression and should seek medical help.People with a depressive illness cannot merely \"pull themselves together\" and get better.Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years and it can be debilitating.Fortunately, today, there is a wide range of medications and therapies available to treat depression.A complex interplay of factors involving genetics, stress, and changes in body and brain function are thought to play a role in the development of depression (Kaufman, 2001).One of the reasons that depression is so common is because the illness may develop for a variety of reasons.A recent study suggests that abnormalities of the hippocampus may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression (Posener et al, 2003).The exact causes of depression are still in question, but scientists have identified certain risk factors that could increase the likelihood of one becoming depressed Family history of depression, stressful situations such as a death in the family or relationship troubles, dependence on alcohol or drugs, medical conditions such as diabetes or cancer, and other mental illnesses are all risk factors that could lead to depression.Depression can take many forms.What differentiates these forms are the severity and duration of the symptoms.However, there often is not a clear distinction between these different types of depression, since they frequently share many of the same characteristics.The different types of depression can be classified as minor depression or dysthymia, major depression, and manic depression (bipolar disorder), and within each of these main categories there are several subtypes.Major depression, sometimes called clinical depression, is the most common form of depression.It is characterized by a mood change that lasts more than two weeks and includes one or both primary signs of depression: overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief, and loss of interest or pleasure in usually enjoyable activities (Kaufman, 2001).People with major depression may also experience recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, feelings of worthlessness, impaired thinking or concentration, insomnia, feeling tired all the time, significant weight loss or gain.These symptoms may differ from person to person as well as from one depressive episode to the next.For example, some people may have insomnia and lose weight while depressed, whereas others may oversleep, overeat and gain weight (Madison Institute of Medicine).In addition, major depression can range from mild to severe, with varying intensity of symptoms.In extreme cases, people with severe depression may be unable to work or care for themselves.Although major depression is the most common form of depression, approximately 26 per cent of individuals with major depression also suffer from chronic minor depression or dsythymia (Harkness et al, 2002).Dysthymia is a long-lasting form of mild depression characterized by a persistently gloomy outlook.Dysthymia generally lasts for at least two years and sometimes more than five years (Mayclinic.com).It usually isn't as disabling as major depression and periods of dysthymia may alternate with intervals of feeling normal.Signs and symptoms of dysthymia are like those of major depression but not as intense (Rapaport et al, 2002).",

In most cases, patients with burning mouth syndrome have accompanying psychologic or psychiatric conditions. Consequently, the syndrome has traditionally been included among the psychogenic dermatoses. However, it is currently unclear whether psychologic factors are a cause or a consequence of the syndrome, or whether each exacerbates the other.

      "abstract": "Intraoperative awareness (IA) is an anesthesia complication defined as the unexpected and explicit recall by patients of events that occurred during anesthesia. This complication represents a potentially traumatic event as it may lead to psychological or psychiatric consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is the most frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA. However, the accurate proportion of PTSD following IA is not known. Due to the low incidence of IA, little is known about risk factors for developing psychiatric or psychological sequelae following IA. However, risk factors for the development of PTSD following trauma, in general, have been extensively explored and can be applied to IA. The common risk factors for PTSD are female gender, younger age, minority status, single status, low socioeconomic status, low level of education, low intelligence, psychiatric history, substance abuse or dependence, severity of the trauma, peritraumatic emotional responses, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, low perceived support following the event, history of past traumatic event(s), life stress, childhood adversity, and family psychiatric history. PTSD symptoms may be experienced in the hours or days following IA but can also be delayed and appear months after the traumatic event. They are variable in duration, from a few weeks to several years. To make a diagnosis, they must be present for at least 1 month. Although PTSD is the more frequently reported psychiatric consequence of IA, it is important to note that other syndromal or subsyndromal mental disorders such as the acute stress disorder and the subsyndromal PTSD may develop following IA. Early management strategies have to be provided in order to reduce the deleterious outcomes of IA, including taking complaints about IA seriously and offering early psychiatric care.",

The symptomatology of these various forms of injury is, of course, manifold, but the outstanding symptom and the one usually present and common to all is convulsions. As a matter of fact, however, the rarity with which definite pathologic lesions are proved to exist is in rather striking contrast to the frequency with which convulsions occur. Indeed, it would seem quite probable that the existence of convulsions in whooping cough has frequently been the principal basis on which a diagnosis of cerebral hemorrhage, encephalitis or other lesion, has been set up. It is the purpose of this paper to call attention to the fact that infantile tetany, and not anatomic injuries or an unknown toxin, is often the cause of the convulsions",

The data suggest that the majority of these patients, all men, had been depressed for a week up to several months. The sudden death then occurred in a setting of acute arousal engendered by increased work and activity or circumstances precipitating reactions of anxiety or anger. The findings suggest that the combination of depressive and arousal psychological states or abrupt transition from one such state to another may produce disharmonious responses in the hormonal and autonomic nervous systems, as well as central nervous system mediated behavior, which are conducive to the sudden death.",

      "title": "The Nature of Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is arbitrary, being based on criteria defined by consensus rather than specific biologic markers. IBS is merely a consortium of symptoms and as presently defined is no more a disease than dyspnea or fatigue are diseases. In this context, it is therefore not surprising that defining the nature of pain has proven elusive. It is often etiologically assumed that the origins of the pain seen in IBS patients are mechanistically distinct from those of some of the other symptoms of IBS such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition pain is assumed to be part of a continuum ranging from complete absence of any pain to varying degrees of discomfort to severe pain. Both of these assumptions should be challenged: there are no data to support the notion that discomfort and pain experienced in IBS are mediated through different pathways than symptoms such as bloating or that they are not merely the consequence of the physiological perturbations associated with altered bowel function. Similarly one can easily argue that visceral pain may actually be the cause rather than the effect of the altered gut function seen in IBS. Abdominal discomfort could then be the consequence of the latter and be only indirectly related to pain. It is likely that central (such as stress) and peripheral factors (such as intestinal infection) will produce similar symptoms but via markedly different pathways. It may be time to deconstruct IBS as a concept and to approach the clinical picture from a mechanistic rather than a phenomenological perspective, particularly if we are interested in understanding the basis of the symptoms and develop effective therapeutic modalities. Our patients deserve no less.",

      "title": "The Multidisciplinary Approach to Occupational Low Back Pain and Disability",
      "abstract": "Chronic disability generates most of the growing costs of occupational low back injuries. When back problems persist for more than a few months, traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are rarely curative. Beyond the challenges of physical impairment, disabling back pain is commonly complicated by psychosocial issues, including depression, fear of reinjury, family discord, and vocational dissatisfaction. The biopsychosocial complexity of chronic disability often demands integrated care from physicians, physical and occupational therapists, psychologists, and vocational counselors. In the past decade, the care of back-injured workers has shifted emphasis from symptom palliation toward functional restoration. This evolution has been possible, in part, through improved quantification of physical capacities. Repeated objective measurements of function guide rehabilitation and recommendations for return to work and other activities. Published results of function-oriented multidisciplinary care depend on the outcome variables reported and the particular socioeconomic setting.",

It is classified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder Fifth edition under the \"obsessive compulsive and related disorders\" section. Often associated with other psychiatric conditions like autism, alcohol abuse, obsessive compulsive, body dysmorphic, mood, anxiety and borderline personality disorders, it is a disorder that is quite often underreported. The patient in this case report is a 58-year-old male with a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) who reported severe anxiety and skin picking episodes over several years. He presented to the emergency room with an extensive wound on distal left foot with exposure of the underlying muscle tissue, that resulted from the excessive picking of skin from the left foot. This compulsive behavior started off with picking the skin around his nail beds and slowly got worse. The skin picking would get worse whenever he gets nervous or anxious. The wound was treated with topical wound care and antibiotics. At the time of discharge, he was prescribed oral antibiotics to complete his course of treatment and was referred to the hospital's cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program that specializes in treatment of OCD and anxiety disorders. Treatment of dermatillomania is a multipronged approach and should include treatment of the underlying psychiatric illness, the treatment for pruritus and topical treatment of the lesions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have proved to be the most effective in treating the psychiatric component of dermatillomania. Non-pharmacological treatments such as behavioral therapy, habit reversal exercises and support groups have also proved to be helpful and are well tolerated amongst patients suffering from dermatillomania.",

      "title": "Molecular markers of behavioral and emotional disorders",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Behavioral and emotional disorders are highly prevalent and heterogeneous common disorders in children and adolescents that include attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive/compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depression and others. These disorders are frequently associated with the negative outcomes in adulthood, substance abuse and dependence, early pregnancy, persistent health problems, increased aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention, obsessions, compulsions, anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, and criminality. These disorders are multifactorial and heterogeneous, with a complex etiology and strong genetic component. No single deficit is sufficient to explain all clinical cases of these disorders. Various child-specific, environmental, demographic, psychosocial, psychiatric, cognitive, developmental and genetic factors, with the stress exposure or adverse early life experiences, and a complicated interplay of these factors, contribute to the development and maintenance of these disorders and antisocial, violent and suicidal behaviors. The neurobiological basis of these disorders is not clear, but it is assumed to involve particular gene mutations and altered functions of the main neurotransmitter (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin /5-HT/) and neuroendocrine (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) systems. Materials and Methods: Platelet markers, monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and 5-HT, and polymorphisms of the genes for catechol-o- methyl-transferase (COMT) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined in male and female children with depression, OCD, ADHD, and phobias. Children were further subdivided according to the gender and suicidal behavior. Clinical diagnoses and suicidal behavior were assessed according to the DSM-IV criteria, different clinical scales and the psychiatric interview. Results: Significant differences were found in platelet 5-HT concentration between healthy boys and girls, but not among suicidal and non-suicidal children. Significant differences in the frequency of the Val66Met BDNF genotypes between suicidal, non-suicidal and healthy groups were detected. The distribution of the Val158/108Met COMT variants, and platelet MAO-B activity, did not differ significantly between the studied groups. Discussion: Our results did not support the hypothesis that reduced platelet 5-HT concentration or lower platelet MAO-B activity or Val158/108Met COMT variants present the risk factors for suicidal behavior in children. The significant contribution of the Met/Val genotype of the Val66Met BDNF to the observed significance suggested that Val66Met BDNF might present a risk factor for suicidal behavior. This result should be confirmed on the larger sample. Since the clinical features of behavioral and emotional disorders are heterogeneous and complex, further research of the risk factors for suicidal behavior is important to identify and properly treat children and adolescents prone to suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, suicidal attempts and completed suicides.",

The differential diagnosis of OCD can be quite difficult since OCD symptomatology can occur as either primary or secondary phenomena. Comorbid depression or personality disorder is not uncommon in patients with primary OCD. Other comorbid conditions that occur with OCD can be divided into three major groups based on core features: (1) disorders of altered risk assessment; (2) incompleteness/habit-spectrum disorders; and (3) psychotic spectrum disorders. Such a categorization of core dimensions and comorbid conditions may prove useful in identifying distinct OCD subtypes that share underlying neurobiological or treatment response characteristics.",

Physical frailty is a complex condition deriving from multiple causes and contributors. It is characterized by the decline of physiological systems, leading to a loss of strength and endurance, and reduced physical ability. Frailty presents an increased risk of vulnerability to disease, dependency and/or death. Frail individuals are also prone to falls and are at greater risk of hospitalization and admission to long-term care. Consequently, there is a need for an effective tool or tools that can easily identify frail community-living individuals at an early stage of physical decline. Screening tools can be performance-based tests, questionnaires or a combination of both.

Chronic/ recurrent disorders seems to have they causes in the particular personality traits and deficits. Some of them are revealed, described and could be measured by means of Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON 2006. In this approach, functional disorder is understood as structured systems of the particular nonverbal language (“parole”) in which symptoms play a role of words while syndromes the role of sentences, expressing the current state of mind – mainly the need of bond with other people and its frustration. They are messages of looking attention, attachment. The use of such language seems to be the result of personality deficits making difficult or even impossible to fulfil the need of bond in the psychosocial field using common for done culture verbal and nonverbal language, “normal” means of communication. While in the acute and conditioned reactions on stress different forms of helping people (e.g. CBT) seems to be adequate, in the chronic and recurrent functional disorders therapy is postulated to aiming rather at transformations of the communication, leading to the exchange of the messages’ language having the quality of disorder for common, mainly verbal one.",

      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD; also known as social phobia) is characterized by fear of social situations involving performance or interaction. This disorder has been formally recognized as a distinct anxiety disorder since DSM-III was published in 1980. In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular. The relation between SAD and TK will become clear in examination by new diagnostic criteria (DSM-5) more in future.",

Visceral hypersensitivity, motor dysfunction, and impaired gastric accommodation are found in some patients with FD, and psychological factors like chronic stress, attention and perception bias are also likely to play a part in the symptom formation. There is considerable overlap of non-specific symptoms like fatigue, headache, abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, and sleep disturbance in patients with different functional disorders, in this article exemplified by FD, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. This overlap of symptoms indicates a common underlying sensitization process, leading to somatization.",

The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam. The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case. The cause of this familial syndrome is presumably different from that or those of acquired, sporadic cases of stiff-man syndrome.",

Acute stress response of the body is associated with activation of various organ systems, resulting in the release of cortisol and catecholamines. Acute stress response subsides on the resolution of the precipitating stimulus. The persistence of the precipitating stimulus results in chronic stress and burn-out. Longitudinal studies have shown that chronic stress can result in both mental and physical health outcomes. The mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorder etc. The physical health outcomes include effects on multiple organ systems. It is, therefore, essential to identify and rectify the precipitating factors to minimize the impact of stress on the human body. [ Psychiatr Ann . 2024;54(10):e272–e276.]",

Etiologic factors involved in this functional disorder include collagen overload of the bladder wall and/or denervation or inhibition phenomena. Cystometric conditions necessary and sufficient for recognition of the disorder are indicated, the stop-test being an indispensable exploration to establish diagnosis. The Lapidès test is reliable when peripheral neurologic lesions are involved but the lesion must be complete; for incomplete lesions greater sensitivity is obtained with electrophysiologic tests such as analytic electromyography, sacral evoked potentials or rapid cystometry. Tests using an alpha-blocker allow recognition and lifting of reflex inhibition, particularly in neurologic patients with high level lesions. Proof of the psychogenic nature of the retention in hysterical patients is more difficult to obtain, and a specific test is not available, apart from histology, for diagnosis of bladder collagenosis.",

In some cases the disorder of a somatic system plays an important etiological rôle; in some cases there are definite emotional idiosyncrasies; in some patients special experiences have sensitized the patient in certain directions; in some there has been, even with fair equipment and with no obvious disorder of the simple emotional reactions, a balance impossible to maintain for an indefinite period. In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

So far, this well-established psychopathological knowledge has been appreciated only insufficiently by the official diagnostic systerms of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV TR) and the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (ICD-10). From a perspective of primary care services, this unmet diagnostic need is deplorable, as the main mode of presenting a depression is by reporting somatic symptoms. This somatic form of presentation, however, significantly contributes to low rates of recognition in primary care. A diagnostic challenge may be seen in the differentiation of a depression with prevailing somatic symptoms from anxiety, somatoform disorders, and medical conditions. When somatic symptoms, particularly painful physical conditions, accompany the already debilitating psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of depression, the course of the illness may be more severe, implying a higher risk of early relapse, chronicity, suicide, or mortality due to other natural causes, the economic burden increases considerably the functional status may be hampered heavily, and health-related quality of life may be lowered dramatically. The neurobiological underpinnings of somatic symptoms in depression may guide more promising treatment approaches.",

      "abstract": "在高三教学中，笔者发现在高三学生中普遍存在着“考试焦虑”心理病症。那么什么是“考试焦虑”呢？考试焦虑就是学生在考试之前。当其意识到考试对其具有某种威胁时，产生的一种以担心、紧张或忧虑为特点的复杂而延续的情绪状态。它的临床表现常常为情绪不稳、易于激动、食欲减退、睡不成眠、心不在焉、恍恍惚惚、特别健忘等心理症状。在日常生活中，几乎人人都有过焦虑的体验。比如人们在面临考试、为择业或其他重要事情而会见某个重要人物时，都会有焦虑的体验。但这种焦虑属于正常焦虑。它能促使我们为即将来临的事件付出更多的努力，从而获得最好的结果。心理学研究表明，适度的焦虑是良性“催化剂”。对考试能够起到积极的作用．有助于考生实际水平的发挥和考试的成功。因此对任何考试来说都是必要的。但是过强或过弱的焦虑则会影响考生的考试成绩。针对考试焦虑的特点和产生原因，笔者在教学活动中推行了“理性情绪疗法”。取得了良好的效果。理性情绪疗法是20世纪50年代创立的。理性情绪疗法的治疗过程一般分为四个阶段：心理诊断阶段；领悟阶段；修通阶段；再教育阶段。具体方案如下：",

      "abstract": "SEVERAL studies have shown that the affective response of \"giving-up,\" when it follows real, threatened, or symbolic loss of a highly valued form of gratification, tends to precede the onset or exacerbation of somatic as well as psychic disease.<sup>1-4</sup>The \"giving-up\" reaction does not cause disease to occur but allows or facilitates whatever disease potential or predisposition exists in the individual or environment to become manifest. As described elsewhere, we think the term \"giving-up\" is expressive of more than what is usually subsumed under the heading of a feeling. In our work we have come to view feelings as indicators of general intrapsychic adaptation. On this basis, \"giving-up\" indicates not only an unpleasant feeling but includes a loss of self-esteem, a disruption in object relationships, a decrease in motivation, and an expectation that such a state may be enduring. Such intrapsychic phenomena appear to be based in part on",

This chapter examines the interrelationship between medical illness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a unique disorder with features of depression and anxiety, from multiple perspectives. Medical illness, especially acute, unexpected illness and injury, can serve as a life-threatening traumatic stressor that precipitates PTSD through multiple mechanisms. PTSD, and even traumatic exposure without subsequent PTSD, may increase the risk of a variety of medical illnesses, with the most-studied illness being cardiovascular disease. PTSD may also worsen the course and outcome of already existing medical illness. Extant research has not addressed the possibility that medical Illness may worsen the course or outcome of PTSD, but similar research has shown only limited effects of medical illness on depression and anxiety outcomes. These reciprocal relationships are thought to exert their effects through mutually reinforcing neurobiological mechanisms as well as through effects on health behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Essential tremor is the commonest of movement disorders. Although sometimes prefaced with the term 'benign’, it often causes significant disability. Diagnosis is based on the clinical finding of a postural tremor, predominantly affecting the upper limbs, that is absent at rest and not associated with extrapyramidal or cerebellar signs. There are, as yet, no specific anatomical, physiological, biochemical or genetic markers for the condition. Postural limb tremors, clinically indistinguishable from essential tremor, may occur in patients who have, or will later develop, other neurological conditions; whether such patients have essential tremor is a matter of controversy that will only be resolved with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of essential tremor. Positron emission tomography in patients with essential tremor reveals increased cerebellar activity even at rest, a finding that is consistent with the cerebellum having an important role in the generation of tremor. Abnormal cerebellar function has also been invoked to account for the abnormal manner in which patients with essential tremor perform rapid voluntary wrist movements. Molecular genetic studies in hereditary essential tremor have been initiated, but with negative results so far. Several new drug treatments have been tried, but with limited success; the role of thalamic stimulation and botulinum toxin in the treatment of essential tremor remains to be judged.",

The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

      "title": "Anxiety and Separation Disorders",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are the emotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identified as threatening or scary. Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and they change throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinking manifestations of fear and anxiety.Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause significant distress or impairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fear response is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs when there is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stress response in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk of both physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present to their primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reporting anxiety. Parents also may report significant changes in behavior, with increased opposition and tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety.Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents, affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be as early as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantial impairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, but most adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice the likelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause family distress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreated anxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includes decreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationship outcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medical illnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders.Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this finding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons children develop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physiologic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute. Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increases the risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood, (3) but many children have no identifiable predisposing factors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individuals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful or anxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase the risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depression and anxiety have a significant influence on attachment, affecting the early environment and brain development of children. Maternal depression and anxiety can influence appropriate emotion regulation and stress responses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatric illnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psychosocial stressors, including school issues, social difficulties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contribute to anxiety disorders.Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to the survival of human beings, involving fright/flight neurobiology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensory input (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus), and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often referred to as components of the limbic system. This system is activated under stress and danger and prepares the body physiologically by activating the sympathetic adrenal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate this response in the brain and to modify fear responses.In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overresponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriate response modulation. The release of stress hormones and adrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (given the situation) without appropriate regulation causes the feelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg, stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate, dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias, chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying, trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassurance all are common manifestations of anxiety. The avoidance and reliance on others to help manage fears may help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can become extreme and interfere with functioning at home, school, and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time.Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specific situations or environments and for others can be more generalized. It is important to distinguish between appropriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxiety disorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usually lasting for many months), interferes substantially with functioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude of the stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adaptive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change or transition (eg, starting school) and are expected responses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usually require intervention by a clinician; stress usually is of short duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely to resolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated by social support or environmental modification alone.Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia are the most common childhood anxiety disorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Several anxiety disorder screening tools have been well validated for use in children and adolescents. The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent and self-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders in youth. These three scales are helpful for identifying youth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoring response to treatment. (6)Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anxiety is a normal stage of early development in preschoolers and during the initial few months of first attending school. It is considered a disorder if it continues past these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional developmental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety disorder fear something bad will happen to them or someone they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they are apart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sight from the parent or caregiver or to have substantial distress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipation of separation. By definition, the duration of the anxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms can manifest as physical complaints on school mornings that usually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behavior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if the feared situation (eg, school) is avoided.Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fall asleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or they sleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affected child demands substantial attention and time, which can lead to less parental time for other children in the family. Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which can result in a parent-child dyad that can exclude other members of the family to manage the child's anxiety. The child becomes dependent on the mother for reassurance and management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losing confidence in his or her ability to manage situations independently.Parents of children who have separation anxiety describe loss of their adult relationships and occupational consequences because at least one parent is home with the child who has not gone to school. Children who have separation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportunities with friends because they do not want to be away from their home and parents. This disorder can cause substantial distress and dysfunction for the child and family and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One of the important functional impairments commonly associated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal. (7)School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or high distress associated with going to school. Although it is not a specific psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can be a symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most commonly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is a complex problem that requires genuine understanding of individual and family factors to develop a successful treatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder is getting the child back into the school environment as soon as possible.It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy. Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report other symptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents. They are not at school, but the reason is not that they need to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear and anxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skipping school, lack of concern or embarrassment about not attending school, refusal to do any school work, and frequently hiding school absences from parents.Specific phobia is the most common type of anxiety disorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of the specific feared situation and less often presents for treatment. Many people have fears, with common ones including heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles. A specific phobia is fear of an object or situation that is not developmentally expected and is out of proportion to the actual danger and manifests as an anxiety response that is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or intense anxiety and panic). The specific fear must be present for at least 6 months and cause the child substantial distress or impairment in functioning to be considered a true phobia. Although many specific phobias do not come to medical attention, fear of needles in a child requiring vaccination and fear of choking with restriction of oral intake are two examples of situations requiring treatment due to associated health risks. Specific phobias sometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such as becoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog). Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition, increased stress in the environment, and modeling behaviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear response to a situation).Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most common anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of the increased importance of peers and social context in adolescent development. Youth who suffer from social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that is extremely distressing and can lead to avoidance and substantial deterioration in overall function. Youth who have social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelming fear of drawing attention to themselves or saying something stupid or embarrassing around others, especially peers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask questions in class, not being able to talk in front of others, avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disorder can result in isolation to the point of rarely leaving home, not having contact with friends, and not attending school.Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in childhood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers around everyday events and responsibilities in the child's life, such as school, friends, health, future, and finances, but the distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or unhelpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children may report feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscle aches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating due to the intensity and chronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affected individuals may have academic performance anxiety that interferes with starting and completing assignments and taking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will not be good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop to prevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessive reassurance from others that nothing bad will happen, leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, and avoidance of everyday activities.Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusive thoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxiety associated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, cause substantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (consuming more than 1 hour per day). The most common obsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning, washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does not always involve observed compulsions, and the individual can suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, of violent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremely distressing. Children who have OCD generally have poor insight into their illness and may not recognize the obsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may have trouble going to school, find they are unable to concentrate in class, have difficulty getting out of the house or getting dressed, and have decreased food intake related to obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly are involved in OCD routines and compulsions with children and teens, and the illness can have a substantial negative impact on family functioning.Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent years but can occur in children. Although not the most common anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitating rapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) most commonly present initially to an emergency department or urgent care center because the physical symptoms are acute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heart attack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panic attacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stress situation when the patient is presented with a feared stimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur \"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning. Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxiety about having another attack, particularly in a place where others might see them or where escape or help might not be possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation they associate with having a panic attack as well as places where they fear that if they did have an attack they would not be able to manage it or get help. Teens who have panic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, refuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stop going to school (or have extreme distress with school attendance).Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents is one of the best-researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includes both specific and nonspecific treatment approaches. Specific approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders and include structured psychotherapies (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). Nonspecific treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, including sleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predictable routine, and social supports.Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as first-line treatment for children who have anxiety disorders when this therapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs and books are available, and the skills often are taught to both parents and child to support the implementation of the strategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxious behaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducation and cognitive and behavior skills training to help individuals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxious children think catastrophically or overexaggerate the negative outcomes of situations and generate avoidant solutions, leading to significant distress and avoidance behaviors.The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety, developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Behavioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress management techniques as well as gradual exposure to the feared situation to modify the anxiety response through systematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3). Many children experience improvement in their anxiety with CBT alone and do not require medication. In some cases, children and teens are unable to learn and use CBT strategies to manage their anxiety without pharmacologic treatment.Medications help decrease overall anxiety symptoms and panic response and should be considered if the anxiety is moderate to severe. The best evidence, supported by both meta-analyses (10) and a Cochrane review, (11) for pharmacologic treatment of childhood anxiety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9) Although some SSRIs have been approved for treating children who have depression (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and OCD (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), SSRIs do not have United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, considerable evidence supports their efficacy. CBT in combination with an SSRI is recommended for moderate-to-severe anxiety disorders. (9)(12) Randomized, controlled trials of SSRI medications (sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) show effectiveness in treating children and adolescents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11)Evidence is insufficient to recommend non-SSRI antidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence supports the efficacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD, but the adverse effect profile does not support its use as first-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have been used for acute management of anxiety, but there is no evidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxiety disorders in children. (9)(11)The risk/benefit ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverse effects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA black box warning for all antidepressants (the rare but increased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideation and behaviors while taking antidepressant medications). Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual increases, as tolerated, according to symptom response and adverse effects, remembering that the medications take several weeks to start working and improvement continues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are not as common in childhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child decrease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learning and using anxiety management strategies. Given the adverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in children and the limited long-term safety data of these medications in the developing brain, medication intervention should be combined with CBT and healthy living strategies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off the medication within 1 year if he or she is doing well.Anxiety has the best chance of improving when both youth and family are educated about anxiety disorders and when there is support of the treatment plan. Numerous randomized, controlled trials support CBT and SSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is to ameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improvement in overall function.",

It also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders. Asthma and these psychological states and traits may mutually potentiate each other through direct psychophysiological mediation, nonadherence to medical regimen, exposure to asthma triggers, and inaccuracy of asthma symptom perception. Defensiveness is associated with inaccurate perception of airway resistance and stress-related bronchoconstriction. Asthma education programs that teach about the nature of the disease, medications, and trigger avoidance tend to reduce asthma morbidity. Other promising psychological interventions as adjuncts to medical treatment include training in symptom perception, stress management, hypnosis, yoga, and several biofeedback procedures.",

      "abstract": "A growing clinical literature indicates that there is a link between substance abuse and stress. One explanation for the high co-occurrence of stress-related disorders and drug addiction is the self-medication hypothesis, which suggests that a dually diagnosed person often uses the abused substance to cope with tension associated with life stressors or to relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression resulting from a traumatic event. However, another characteristic of self-administration is that drug delivery and its subsequent effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are under the direct control of the individual. This controlled activation of the HPA axis may produce an internal state of arousal or stimulation that is actually sought by the individual. During abstinence, exposure to stressors or drug-associated cues can stimulate the HPA axis and thereby remind the individual about the effects of the abused substance, thus producing craving and promoting relapse. Stress reduction, either alone or in combination with pharmacotherapies targeting the HPA axis, may prove beneficial in reducing cravings and promoting abstinence in individuals seeking treatment for addiction.",

Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is primarily supportive and dictated by symptoms. Standard antiepileptic medication for seizure disorder; standard treatment for abnormal vision and/or strabismus, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, joint laxity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, and developmental issues. Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters, feeding difficulties, GERD, constipation, scoliosis, developmental progress, and behavior at each visit. Monitor seizures as clinically indicated. Assessment of vision and eye alignment as needed. Genetic counseling BCL11A-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo BCL11A pathogenic variant. Once the BCL11A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "OA07 What is effective pain management: an illustrative case report?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction/Background Pain is a sensory and emotional experience perceived in terms of tissue damage and expressed in terms of altered behaviour. Chronic, medically unexplained pain is complex, disabling and common. It is important to rule out medical or modifiable causes, but most tests will not result in significant changes in management nor prognosis. Attempting rehabilitation before the patient narrative has been fully explained usually leads to a lack of progress. Sleep deprivation is important to acknowledge and restorative sleep has analgesic and fatigue-improving properties. Prior mood disturbances may alter management, particularly if bereavement or post-traumatic memories are present. Adverse childhood events occur more frequently than expected in this population. Somatisation and personality disorders will need expert evaluation and management. Significant anxiety and depression should be managed independent of pain report. Physical rehabilitation is effective in restoring function which can lead to a recovery of identity and workplace productivity. Altering health beliefs and cognition can be important as part of this process. Exercise prescriptions and access to support during this process are also important. Analgesic medications usually have little to offer other than side effects, but can be used to bridge difficult times, particularly if patient expectations align with their use. Strong opioids should not be started, unless no other options are available, and always with a time- and dose-limit, preferably less than 50mg daily of morphine equivalent for less than 3 months. We present the case of a young gentleman of working age with chronic back pain who underwent effective pain management to restore good function including a full return to work, improvement in his mood, sleep, physical function and quality of life. Description/Method 43 year old manager working as a Risk Manager developed back pain without trauma that affected all three segments. There was no morning stiffness, night pain nor gelling history. His pain was worse on exercise and when standing. The pain was intrusive and affecting his quality of life, to the extent that he could not attend work. Time away from the workplace was adding stress and affecting his mood and, intermittently, his sleep. There was no history of night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, significant leg pain nor numbness in his feet nor saddle area. There was no loss of control in his bowel nor urine habit. His blood tests (FBC, LFT, Creat, ESR, CRP, vitamin D, ESR, CRP) were normal. An MRI scan of his whole spine showed minor degenerative disc changes but no significant bone changes nor neural compression. His medications were sertraline 50mg once daily, meloxicam 7.5mg once daily and omeprazole 20mg once daily. The pain management programme teaches self-management approaches to patients experiencing chronic pain. It is delivered by a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a nurse and a clinical psychologist. Its aim is to help patients to maintain or increase their physical functioning and to regain their sense of control in the context of their life. In turn, patients may improve in their well-being and their quality of life, despite their chronic pain. The programme runs for twelve days with patients attending as out-patients, four days a week for three weeks. Reviews take place at one month, six months and one year following this. Discussion/Results Table 1 outlines the improvement in his outcomes. Self-efficacy scores rose first with associated drops in catastrophisation and kinesiophobia. Anxiety and depression scores also dropped after the first 6 weeks. Pain significantly reduced along with improvements in quality of life and return to full employment 6 months later. Key learning points/Conclusion Patients with chronic pain have significant disability, poor quality of life and are not economically productive. Pain management programmes are well evidenced to restore function and improve quality of life. Pain scores typically drop later and full employment can be regained, thus suggesting a cost-effectiveness of such programmes for a population.",

      "title": "Mindfulness for surgeons",
      "abstract": "In addition to having the knowledge and technical skills to practice surgery, an ideal surgeon is attentive and focused, relaxed, deals with contingencies calmly, flexible and resilient, unburdened by previous cases or external situations, and is warm and compassionate to patients, families and colleagues. In reality, surgeons, like most humans, are typically not really present. Our minds are commonly described as 'monkey minds', restless, confused and easily distracted, with attention easily hijacked by stimuli, little different from a monkey that jumps from branch to branch side-tracked by fruits or anything of fleeting interest. Humans tend to daydream and ruminate about negative events, past failures and future worries.1, 2 The mind reacts to such events resulting in anger, irritation, frustration, excitement, sadness or disgust. This highly reactive and untamed mind can result in depression, anxiety, addictions and interpersonal conflicts. In short, the untrained mind is prone to being unhappy.1 Mindfulness is an alternate mind state or way of being to the typical stressed and untrained state that predisposes physicians and surgeons to fatigue and burnout.3-8 Mindfulness is distinct from other stress management techniques such as going on holiday or using alcohol, both of which are forms of escaping from the problem. After the holiday or upon sobering up, the problem remains or is worsened. There is no escaping from stress as there will always be stress. However, instead of running away from stress, an alternative approach is to change the way we generate and relate to it. Mindfulness allows practitioners to look at their stress calmly, accepting the situation and then responding appropriately. Mindfulness is not a way out of daily troubles but instead is a 'way in'. Mindfulness is among the most poorly understood terms in contemporary psychological parlance. It is often confused with meditating, yoga or any number of ostensibly 'new age' fashions. Admittedly, it is true that mindfulness has a tradition stretching back more than 2500 years with roots in the Buddhist tradition where mindfulness and compassion are seen as the path for genuine happiness and enlightenment. However, modern conceptualizations of mindfulness have less to do with religion or spirituality and more to do with attempting to cultivate a very particular mental state, one characterized by continuous awareness of the present moment in a calm and accepting manner. Rather than ruminatively chewing on events that occurred in the past or frenetically evaluating what the future may bring, the attention of the mindful person rests here and now. In some ways, however, mindfulness is also defined by what it is not. It is not religious. Though developed and practiced by Buddhists, mindfulness does not concern itself with deity worship, spirits or the afterlife, and does not require sitting in a lotus position chanting. Though traditional mindfulness meditation is practised while seated, one can learn and practise mindfulness in many ways from sitting on a chair or walking from the car park to the hospital to possibly even while performing a procedure. Mindfulness does not involve stopping thinking, which is almost impossible to do while awake and conscious. Mindfulness will not eliminate stress and disappointments. However, mindfulness will allow a person to accept stress and frustration as part of life. Being attentive to the present moment involves knowing and accepting the emotional state we are in, whether we are relaxed, tense, frustrated, happy, neutral, grateful or angry. In this mindful state, we are also aware of current bodily sensations (e.g. the breath, the feel of the gloves hugging the hands) as well as of environmental stimuli (e.g. soft wind on the face while walking from the car park). A mindful person is calmly accepting of whatever will happen, resulting in a relaxed mind. For example, if a surgeon accidentally nicks a major vessel, the surgeon curses himself, thinking that he should not be making mistakes. Worrying that this patient will die on the table does not help the impending disaster. He starts barking at his assistant who then makes more mistakes. The theatre atmosphere feels heavy and the anxious anaesthetist makes a poor judgment call. On the other hand, a surgeon who calmly accepts the accident as part of the life of even the most skilled surgeon will be focused and unruffled and can address the major bleed more effectively, supported by an unflustered team. Without denying their existence or import, mindfulness can tame the emotional parts of the brain (e.g. limbic system and amygdala) while enhancing the logical prefrontal cortex to come up with a repertoire of options.9 Viewed in this manner, mindfulness is perhaps less foreign or off-putting to the surgeon. Indeed, the physical and psychological state of calm engagement, absorption, and focus the best surgeons experience while operating is a good example of the advantages mindfulness can bring to performance. This desirable state, sometimes called a 'flow' experience, is a period of total immersion and union with the activity.10 To reiterate, mindfulness is not a religious practice and instead is a mind training exercise. The best way to develop the ability to be mindful is to practise, beginning with short periods of mindfulness exercises then progressively incorporating mindfulness into daily activities. Learning mindfulness is not different from learning a new sport or a new surgical technique. It requires regular practice, patience and an open attitude to the learning. So mindfulness is not a religion, nor is it a cult. It is a way of being mentally and physically 'present' that is familiar to many surgeons (at least in work) and bears a resemblance to experiences of flow. The question that remains, however, is why surgeons should care about mindfulness or consider its practice as a part of their professional development. Although there are few studies of mindfulness among health-care professionals, early results are promising.11 Studies among other non-professional and patient populations, however, suggest that mindfulness interventions and practice are associated with benefits in a massive range of mental and physical health outcomes. Briefly, mindfulness has been linked to better quality of life,12, 13 subjective well-being and mood,11, 14 subjective health,15 and sleep;16 objective benefits are evident in patient samples including persons with pain, hypertension and arthritis.14 Mindfulness lowers stress,17 anxiety and depression,14, 18 and emotional exhaustion,4, 6, 11 prevents depression relapse,19 and reduces the extent to which stress produces depression and anxiety.20 Emotional reactivity to stressors is reduced21-24 and recovery may be enhanced.25 Cognitively, mindfulness is associated with improved executive functioning,26 better attention,27-29 reduced emotional interference in cognitive tasks,30 more situationally appropriate decision-making31 and better behavioural regulation.23 Relevant to doctors, mindfulness lessens the chance of physician diagnostic errors32 and promotes better connection with patients.3, 6 Finally, mindfulness interventions have been linked to sustained improvement and recovery of immune function,26, 33, 34 greater antibody titer response to influenza vaccinations,35 greater telomerase activity,36 as well as increases in left-sided anterior activation35 but reduced limbic reactivity37-41 in brain imaging work. These effects are not inconsequential, with reviews suggesting a standardized effect size of 0.5 on health.15 Similar to aspirin preventing future cardiovascular events,42-44 mindfulness appears to be protective against physician burnout.4, 6 Given that many surgeons naturally practise a form of mindfulness while performing surgery, it is a short step to allowing this way of being to extend to other areas of life. Given the chronic, high levels of stress and burnout surgeons' experience,45 and the repeatedly demonstrated benefits of mindfulness in terms of such outcomes, developing the capacity to be mindful may have immediate and very real mental and physical health benefits. So mindfulness interventions appear to work. The average surgeon, however, may or may not have the time to allocate evenings for 8 weeks in formal training (e.g. MBSR5) or to sit and meditate for substantial amounts of time. Fortunately then, while mindfulness skills can be acquired in this way, they can also be obtained in small 'doses', structured to fit around the busy professional and personal lives most surgeons live. Instructions for mindfulness exercises and meditations are offered online (e.g. www.calm.auckland.ac.nz46) and in books (e.g. Siegel's book 'Mindsight: the new science of personal transformation'47). Beginners can start with short daily exercises of 5 min, gradually lengthening the duration; regular practitioners allocate 30 min to formal practice as well as incorporating mindfulness states into daily activities. To begin, find a quiet place and time with minimal distraction or interruption. Remind yourself to try to focus on the exercise for 5 min. Close your eyes and assume a half smile (creates a gentle positive state) and take three slow, deep breaths; pay attention to the sensations of breathing. After that, simply breathe normally while paying attention to the process. Sooner or later, you will inevitably get distracted by thoughts, sounds or judgments. When this happens, simply notice the distraction and return to breath. At the end of 5 min, gradually cease the practice and be grateful for having those 5 min of quiet. As when you learn a new sport, the DIY approach can only bring you to a certain level of proficiency. Many beginning meditators give up too quickly because they notice their minds are very busy and judge themselves as unable to be mindful. In actual fact, the contrary is true in that they are becoming mindful of their baseline busy mental state, which already indicates significant progress. To further enhance mindfulness skills, attending suitable courses or having one-on-one mindfulness coaching will be very helpful. Like any new skill, practice and patience is important. Try not to focus on the end point or outcome as the process itself is beneficial. Studies have shown that naïve mindfulness trainees notice improvement in mental and health outcomes, with brain changes and increased immune functioning with 4–8 weeks of regular practice.6, 13, 35 Within the demanding and stressful life of a surgeon, mindfulness is an alternative way of being. The evidence is strong in terms of the physical and psychological benefits of mindfulness. Though it requires practice, learning it is not hard and will pay benefit for both surgeons and their patients.",

In Part 1 the precise clinical description of fasciculations, myokymia and cramps/spasms was made using a dynamic holistic approach. The differences are often a matter of excitation quantity. Correlations with electrophysiological findings were elaborated on the grounds of literature data and personal experience. Electrophysiological correlations with clinically visible fasciculations resulted in the finding that the same clinical phenomenon may have many entirely different electrophysiological correlates. The special forms of repetitive discharges were described additionally: positive giant potentials of quadriceps muscles appearing in healthy muscular individuals and grouped potential discharges of very chronic nerve ending involvement. The electrophysiological features and genesis of many motor unit hyperexcitability signs were discussed, while topic differentiation possibilities and symptomatic treatment were recommended for some. The spontaneous activity in different nosological entities was presented in Part 2. Again the literature data on diseases with conspicuous fasciculations, myokymia and cramps with additional personal experiences (pesticide intoxication, Isaacs syndrome, hereditary autosomal cramp disease, chronic syndrome due to parathyroid insufficiency, chronic tetanus and others) were presented. A description was also given of personal observations in strictly localized forms: single nerve or root lesions and in M. Romberg patient. Symptomatic and causal treatment was suggested for some of them. Clinically similar signs may have entirely different causes responding specifically to carbamazepine, D3, PAM, or surgical decompression. The electromyographic finding may remain clinically silent even in myotonia.",

      "abstract": "Unlike acute pain that warns us of injury or disease, chronic or persistent pain serves no adaptive purpose. Though there is no agreed on definition of chronic pain, it is commonly referred to as pain that is without biological value, lasting longer than the typical healing time, not responsive to treatments based on specific remedies, and of a duration greater than 6 months. Chronic pain that is severe and intractable has detrimental consequences, including psychological distress, job loss, social isolation, and, not surprisingly, it is highly comorbid with depression and anxiety. Historically, pain without an apparent anatomical or neurophysiological origin was labelled as psychopathological. This approach is damaging to the patient and provider alike. It pollutes the therapeutic relationship by introducing an element of mutual distrust as well as implicit, if not explicit, blame. It is demoralizing to the patient who feels at fault, disbelieved, and alone. Moreover, many medically unexplained pains are now understood to involve an interplay between peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms that have gone awry. The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, somatic symptom disorder overpsychologizes people with chronic pain; it has low sensitivity and specificity, and it contributes to misdiagnosis, as well as unnecessary stigma. Adjustment disorder remains the most appropriate, accurate, and acceptable diagnosis for people who are overly concerned about their pain.",

The disorder has a resemblance to many other disorders described in the past including myalgic encephalitis and post-infective fatigue; however, the term itself and the criteria for diagnosing this disorder were first laid out in 1988. The disorder has received attention from a wide range of clinicians and researchers. The mechanism of causation of this disorder has been poorly understood, though biological, psychological and social factors seem to play a role. The disorder causes significant impairment and is highly comorbid with other disorders. Non-pharmacological measures like graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy seem to work better for treatment than pharmacological measures. This narrative review takes an overview of chronic fatigue syndrome from a generalist standpoint and looks into the clinical features, etiopathogenesis and management of this disorder.",

Pain becomes chronic only when this unpleasant sensory and emotional experience persists for much longer than expected relative to the severity or duration of the initial noxious stimulus. The regions of symptom onset, patterns of radiation or referral to other body sites, and any association with loss or excess of somatic sensation within the symptomatic regions have major relevance in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. In patients who suffer from multiple pain types or regions, or in whom there coexists abnormal perception of different modes of sensory stimulation, documenting clinical data using only verbal descriptors can be overwhelming. Historically, large portions of the autonomic nervous system have been thought of as only being responsible for the creation of involuntary physiological responses to acute, stressful or noxious stimuli.",

Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment. It is therefore important to understand its underlying mechanisms in order to fight it more efficiently.La stigmatisation est un phénomène social très commun, basé sur la discrimination d’un individu ou d’un sous-groupe d’individus par un groupe dominant ou majoritaire.

A diagnosis is based on identifying the consistent symptoms with the exclusion of other organic or functional disorders having similar clinical presentations in a cost-effective manner. A physical examination should be performed on the first visit and on subsequent visits as needed. Two algorithms for the evaluation of patients seen in primary care settings and two other algorithms for patients presenting to gastroenterologists are presented. In general, if Rome II criteria are fulfilled, alarm features are not present, and screening studies from the referring physician are negative, further testing is not needed. Screening studies are recommended when certain historical information is present. In many cases, the therapeutic trial can be undertaken before further diagnostic studies are done and will depend on the symptom subtype and its severity. It needs to be emphasized that patients presenting with typical symptoms and no alarm signs are rarely found to have another diagnosis, supporting the benefit of ongoing care and symptomatic management rather than continued diagnostic evaluation. If initial treatment fails, or certain clinical features emerge requiring further evaluation, studies may be performed by gastroenterologists in specialty centers.",

      "abstract": "Neurosurgical operations treat involuntary movement disorders (MvDs), spasticity, cranial neuralgias, cancer pain, and other selected disorders, and implantable neurostimulation or drug delivery devices relieve MvDs, epilepsy, cancer pain, and spasticity. In contrast, studies of surgery or device implantations to treat chronic noncancer pain or mental conditions have not shown consistent evidence of efficacy and safety in formal, randomized, controlled trials. The success of particular operations in a finite set of disorders remains at odds with disconfirming results in others. Despite expectations that surgery or device implants would benefit particular patients, the normalization of unproven procedures could jeopardize the perceived legitimacy of functional neurosurgery in general. An unacknowledged challenge in functional neurosurgery is the limitation of biological determinism, wherein network activity is presumed to exclusively or predominantly mediate nociception, affect, and behavior. That notion regards certain pain states and mental conditions as disorders or dysregulation of networks, which, by implication, make them amenable to surgery. Moreover, implantable devices can now detect and analyze neural activity for observation outside the body, described as the extrinsic or micro perspective. This fosters a belief that automated analyses of physiological and imaging data can unburden the treatment of selected mental conditions and pain states from psychological subjectivity and complexity and the inherent sematic ambiguity of self-reporting. That idea is appealing; however, it discounts all other influences. Attempts to sway public opinion and regulators to approve deep brain stimulation for unproven indications could, if successful, harm the public interest, making demands for regulatory approval beside the point.",

      "title": "Mecanismos neurobiológicos e inmunes que subyacen al déficit en control inhibitorio: estudios preclínicos",
      "abstract": "El deficit de control inhibitorio es un problema social y de salud con un impacto economico sustancial y complejas implicaciones de diagnostico. Las fallas en el control inhibitorio a menudo resultan en consecuencias no deseadas para el individuo, generalmente expresadas en terminos de compulsividad y / o impulsividad. La compulsividad es una caracteristica central en el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC) y tambien comorbida en varios trastornos neuropsiquiatricos, como la esquizofrenia, el autismo y la adiccion. Este comportamiento se define como la perseverancia de una respuesta irresistible e inapropiada para el individuo e inevitable a pesar de sus consecuencias negativas. Por otro lado, la impulsividad incluye acciones mal concebidas, prematuramente expresadas, excesivamente arriesgadas o inapropiadas para la situacion, y es un componente clave en todos los trastornos neuropsicopatologicos diferentes, incluido el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH), el autismo y la esquizofrenia. Sin embargo, ambos constructos tienen un posible significado de diagnostico cruzado, aplicandolos a comorbilidades y puntos en comun en una variedad de trastornos. Estudios preclinicos y clinicos han demostrado la implicacion de los circuitos fronto-estriatal-limbicos en el deficit de control inhibitorio. Especificamente, el receptor serotoninergico 5-HT2A ha demostrado estar implicado en conductas impulsivas y compulsivas. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de la presente tesis fue, primero, estudiar el papel de los receptores 5-HT2A de la corteza prefrontal medial (mPFc) en la bebida compulsiva en la polidipsia inducida por programa (SIP). Para ello, realizamos microinfusiones intra-mPFc de DOI -agonista de 5-HT2A/C-, M100907 -antagonista de 5-HT2A- y SB242084 - antagonista de 5-HT2C-. La activacion de los receptores 5-HT2A/C dentro del mPFc dio como resultado una reduccion de la bebida compulsiva en ratas altas bebedoras (HD) seleccionadas por SIP, efecto que se bloqueo por la administracion conjunta de M100907 pero no de SB242084. Ademas, investigamos si las ratas altas y bajas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP mostraron diferencias basales en el “binding” del receptor 5-HT2A en estructuras cruciales para el control inhibitorio. Las ratas compulsivas HD menor “binding” en la amigdala basolateral (BLA) en comparacion con las bajas bebedoras (LD) seleccionadas por SIP. La plasticidad cerebral desadaptativa se ha relacionado con el deficit de control inhibitorio, subyacente a las diferencias individuales en cuanto a las conductas impulsivas o compulsivas en sujetos vulnerables. Por lo tanto, investigamos la morfologia de las estructuras cerebrales relacionadas con el control inhibitorio en animales altos y bajos compulsivos. Las ratas HD mostraron una disminucion del volumen del hipocampo y un aumento del volumen de BLA despues de la reexposicion SIP, comparadas con las HD no reexpuestas y la LD reexpuestas. La activacion inmune se ha propuesto como un factor crucial implicado en la vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio gracias a su estudio con modelos preclinicos. En el presente trabajo expusimos a los animales a Lipopolisacarido (LPS) y a antigeno de estreptococo del Grupo A (GAS) en etapas tempranas con el fin de estudiar con tareas conductuales especificas sus posibles efectos a largo plazo en relacion con el deficit de control inhibitorio. Ademas, exploramos si esta vulnerabilidad podria ser dinamitada por el estres y/o paliada por el tratamiento con antibiotico. Tambien evaluamos los efectos en biomarcadores inmunes cerebrales, como la interleucina-6 (IL-6), la interleucina-17 (IL-17) y el factor de necrosis tumoral α (TNFα). La exposicion a LPS aumento la compulsividad mediante respuestas perseverativas en “5-choice serial reaction time task” (5-CSRT task). La exposicion a GAS incremento el comportamiento impulsivo por respuestas prematuras en la tarea 5-CSRT en condiciones basales, y tanto la exposicion a GAS como la administracion del antibiotico ampicilina incrementaron el comportamiento impulsivo despues de aumentar el intervalo entre ensayos (ITI) de 5 a 7s. Por otra parte, la exposicion a GAS incremento la toma de decisiones impulsivas en “delay-discounting task”, efecto que fue revertido delay=20s por el tratamiento antibiotico. La exposicion a GAS disminuyo los niveles de IL-6 y aumento los niveles de TNFα en NAcc, y mostro un efecto combinado cuando se administro con el antibiotico disminuyendo los niveles de IL-17 en PFc. Hubo una correlacion positiva entre los niveles de TNFα en NAcc y en PFc con ambas medidas de impulsividad. La presente tesis refuerza la idea de la implicacion de los receptores 5-HT2A en el deficit de control inhibitorio; especificamente, su activacion dentro de mPFc redujo la compulsividad en ratas HD en SIP. Se reportan alteraciones morfologicas en hipocampo y amigdala en ratas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP, apuntando asi a cambios en la plasticidad cerebral como mecanismos subyacentes en trastornos psicopatologicos impulsivos-compulsivos. Ademas, la presente tesis muestra un papel putativo de la activacion inmune como factor de vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio a largo plazo.",

      "title": "Phantom Limb Pain",
      "abstract": "Phantom limb is a complex pain phenomenon that is perceived by patients after a limb has been amputated. Many patients have the persistent perception that the particular limb that was lost is still present. This phenomenon, which may be painful and nonpainful, may develop immediately after amputation or in years following the incident. This phenomenon should not be confused with residual limb pain, formerly described as “stump pain,” which is pain that resides in the residual limb attached to the body. Phantom limb pain (PLP) is described similarly to other neuropathic pain conditions as burning, gnawing, stabbing, pressure, aching, squeezing, and knifelike. PLP is associated with a myriad of symptoms and considered one of the most challenging chronic pain conditions. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon can be supraspinal, spinal, and peripheral. PLP remains a very challenging condition to treat. The therapies are similar to those of any other neuropathic pain states. A multimodal approach that includes interventional therapy, pharmacotherapy, rehabilitation, surgery, and preemptive analgesia working together improves success. Key words: Amputation, amputee, central sensitization, mirror therapy, neuropathic pain, phantom limb pain, residual limb pain",

      "abstract": "Acute pain within the various components of the musculoskeletal system is a cardinal symptom of the pathophysiological processes involved with tissue damage, disease, or dysfunction. These disorders are generally wellcharacterised and management usually associated with good symptomatic and functional outcomes. Immediate activation of an inbuilt and hard-wired basic pain system serves a primary protective function to the host. Another system, perhaps best described as an advanced pain system, augments, amplifies, and extends the role of the pain system to other functions. Emotional distress has a potent effect on this process and drives a series of events that results in altered ‘downstream’ musculoskeletal symptoms and function. Under these circumstances chronic pain states may arise and may particularly involve the musculoskeletal tissues. Fibromyalgia syndrome is used here as an example of a common chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome, characterised by widespread pain and tenderness, in order to allow for discussion of the biopsychosocial inputs that must be addressed to provide the best clinical outcome. Emphasis is placed on understanding the nature of these problems, particularly to enhance reversibility and hence improve outcomes.",

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

This paper reviews the frequency and features of this outcome, and its association with relapse. Residual symptoms occur in many depressed patients after acute treatment. They span the typical symptoms of depression, except those characteristic of severe disorders. Other persistent abnormalities include social dysfunction, dysfunctional attitudes, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis overactivity, shortened REM sleep latency, and mood lowering after tryptophan depletion. Associations of some of these with residual symptoms are not clear. There is growing evidence for similar residual symptoms in bipolar disorder, particularly bipolar depression. The most important consequence of residual symptoms is a much-increased risk of relapse, particularly in the first year. Residual symptoms are a strong indication for vigorous and longer than usual continuation of antidepressant treatment in order to prevent relapse. There is good evidence for the use of cognitive therapy as an adjunct.",

Such emphasis on an atheoretical phenomenology is aimed at enhancing agreement among clinicians and investigators and is expected to facilitate objective research.

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness is a condition where muscles do not contract as strongly as they should, resulting in difficulty moving or using them. It can result from a variety of underlying causes, including neurological, muscular, metabolic, autoimmune, and systemic disorders. Common reasons of muscle weakness contain myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies, peripheral neuropathies, and electrolyte imbalances. The onset of these conditions can be either sudden or gradual, depending on the underlying etiology.. Muscle weakness is often accompanied by other neurological abnormalities. A thorough diagnostic workup typically involving clinical assessment, lab tests, electromyography, imaging, and occasionally muscle biopsy is essential to determine the cause. Identifying the root cause is key to guiding appropriate treatment and improving outcomes. Muscle weakness can also result from disuse atrophy (lack of exercise), A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management can help improve muscle health and function. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to address underlying conditions causing nerve damage or compression. Muscle weakness often arises from insufficient physical activity, aging, muscle injuries, or pregnancy. Chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease can also contribute to this issue. Other potential causes include neurological disorders such as stroke and multiple sclerosis, as well as mental health conditions like depression. A common contributor to muscle deconditioning is a sedentary lifestyle. When muscles aren't regularly engaged, muscle fibers can be replaced by fat, leading to muscle atrophy and increased fatigue during daily activities",

Individuals with BDD suffer from time-consuming obsessions about their bodily appearance and excessive compulsive behaviors (for example, mirror-checking, excessive grooming, and skin-picking). Functioning and quality of life are typically very poor, and suicidality is markedly elevated. BDD currently affects 0.7% to 2.9% of the population; however, BDD typically goes unrecognized in clinical settings. This chapter discusses BDD’s definition and classification, epidemiology, demographics, and clinical features, including several case descriptions of BDD, age at onset, course of illness, comorbidity, morbidity (including suicidality), gender similarities and differences, and healthcare utilization. In addition, BDD’s relationships to obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders, and social anxiety disorder are discussed.",

The etiology of sleep bruxism is uncertain: while the occlusal discrepancies and the anatomy of the bony structures of the orofacial region play only a minor role, others factors, like smoking, alcohol, drugs, systemic diseases, stress, trauma and heredity, appear to have an important role in the sleep bruxism genesis. Recent polysomnographic studies, suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are part of an sleep arousal response. The sleep arousal response is a sudden change in the depth of sleep. Besides the sleep bruxism appears to be an disturbance in the dopaminergic system. Further psychological factors (like stress, anxiety) are implicated in the aetiology of sleep bruxism as well.

      "abstract": "Most patients with epilepsy report that seizures are sometimes, or exclusively, provoked by general internal precipitants (such as stress, fatigue, fever, sleep, and menstrual cycle) and by external precipitants (such as excess alcohol, heat, bathing, eating, reading, and flashing lights). Some patients describe very exotic and precise triggers, like tooth brushing or listening to a particular melody. Nevertheless, the most commonly noticed seizure increasers by far are stress, lack of sleep, and fatigue. Recognized reflex seizure triggers are usually sensory and visual, such as television, discotheques, and video games. Visually evoked seizures comprise 5% of the total of 6% reflex seizures. The distinction between provocative and reflex factors and seizures seems artificial, and in many patients, maybe all, there is a combination of these. It seems plausible that all of the above-mentioned factors can misbalance the actual brain network; at times, accumulation of factors leads then to primary generalized, partial, or secondarily generalized seizures. If the provoking factors are too exotic, patients may be sent to the psychiatrist. Conversely, if the seizure-provoking fluctuating mechanisms include common habits and environmental factors, these may hardly be considered as provocative factors. Awareness of precipitating factors and its possible interactions might help us to unravel the pathophysiology of epilepsy and to change the notion that seizure occurrence is unpredictable. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, treatment, and especially similarities in the variety of provocative and reflex factors with resulting general hypotheses.",

The pains are assumed to be due to locally limited epileptic discharges in areas of the cortex where the digestive tract is represented. When the neuronal discharges reach other brain formations, multisymptomatic, partial or generalized epileptic seizures occur. In such cases, therefore, the abdominal symptomatology is either a first stage or a rudiment of a more complex course of attack, and should not be considered as the expression of a particular form of epilepsy that might be termed abdominal epilepsy. Difficulties regarding differential diagnosis ensue in the case of migraine with abdominal symptomatology. The latter should be taken into account when relapsing attacks of abdominal pain, which cannot be explained gastroenterologically, persist for hours and alternate with headache. In case of doubt, a family history of migraine confirms the diagnosis.",

While classical forms of major hysteria are less frequent in occurrence in recent years, the etiological basis of the pattern still is clinically significant. Conversion reactions and psychophysiological reactions affecting various body systems continue to be a part of the spectrum of psychiatric illness seen in active practice. While no organic cause for the symptoms is present, the loss of function, when substantial and persistent, equates with the loss of function resulting from actual organic disease. Not all of these reactions occur in the ‘hysterical personality’, and both social and cultural patterns must be taken into account. In evaluating the severity of an impairment (loss of function) resulting from a functional illness, the psychological and physiological homeostasis of the patient is a crucial consideration. Symptoms derived from purely conscious reactions are seldom associated with actual loss of function.",

      "title": "When disaster strikes, acute stress disorder may follow",
      "abstract": "Abstract During and immediately following a traumatic event, people may manifest a pattern of dissociative and anxiety symptoms and other reactions, referred to as Acute Stress Disorder. A review of the empirical literature on psychological reactions to trauma suggest that this pattern of symptoms has often been identified across different kinds of traumatic events. It is likely to constitute a psychological adaptation to a stressful event, limiting painful thoughts and feelings associated with the event and allowing the person to function at least minimally. Continuation of these symptoms, however, may impair the person's quality of life and disrupt social and other functioning. If symptoms last beyond a month following the traumatic event, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may ensue, continuing for months or even years after the precipitating event. Hence, it is important to be able to identify this pattern of reactions that may be manifested in reaction to trauma, so that appropriate intervention can be provided. Although it was not officially recognized in the 3rd edition Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM‐III‐R), Acute Stress Disorder is included as a separate diagnosis in the DSM‐IV.",

This review aims to show the medical personnel who faces for the first time a child and his family, who consult for short stature, how to make a comprehensive clinical assessment of the patient to determine and confirm the suspected diagnosis and car- ry out the proper approach to each case individually, keeping in mind that the causes of short stature may be of endocrine origin or may be determined by diseases involving other systems.

      "abstract": "It is widely assumed that psychopathic behaviour arises from unsatisfactory parenting, but upbringing difficulties are equally apparent in other psychiatric disorders. The poor response to psychological treatments is noteworthy and organic features, of a specific type, have been implicated. The most recent evidence strongly supports earlier findings of a genetic factor. Damage or malfunction of the left temporal lobe of the brain, or of the frontal area, are associated with violent psychopathic behaviour. Dysfunction in these same areas has also been found in schizophrenic patients and there is a genetic relationship between psychopathy and schizophrenia. It is concluded that organic factors probably underpin some psychopathic behaviour, a situation which may affect our attitudes.",

      "title": "Evaluating Adolescents With Fatigue",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Unexplained fatigue in adolescents is a common and frustrating complaint that can pose a challenge for even the most experienced physicians. Although the cause usually is benign and self-limited, occasionally there is a serious underlying disorder. This symptom cannot be dismissed without performing a thorough medical history, detailed psychosocial profile, and careful physical examination. Selective use of laboratory and radiologic studies should be considered when specifically indicated. If the cause remains unclear, sequential visits often provide clues for the practitioner and reassurance for the family. The purpose of this article is to offer guidelines to the clinician caring for adolescents who have prolonged, unexplained fatigue and to stress the value of a thorough history and physical examination.For purposes of this discussion, fatigue will be defined as abnormal exhaustion after usual activities. An arbitrary cutoff of 1 month is used to distinguish acute from chronic fatigue. The term chronic fatigue syndrome is avoided because criteria for this condition are not clearly established in children or adolescents, and data must be extrapolated from studies in adults. The term neurally mediated hypotension is used to describe a fall in blood pressure in response to assuming the upright posture, physical events, and emotional stressors. Affected patients may be syncopal or presyncopal. Neurally mediated hypotension also is referred to in the literature as neurocardiogenic syncope, vasovagal reflex, vasodepressor syncope, and autonomic dysfunction.The best way to approach a problem of this nature is to establish a good relationship with adolescents and their parents so they will trust your recommendations and not pressure you into unnecessary tests or referrals. The examination begins when the family enters the office by greeting the patient first to establish a direct relationship immediately. It is worthwhile to obtain the history while the patient is fully clothed because adolescents usually feel more relaxed under these circumstances. Initially, the patient and parents are interviewed together, assuring both parties that there will be adequate time later to speak with the examiner alone. While taking the history, the clinician should demonstrate a willingness to listen and be particularly alert for any clues of a hidden agenda or an underlying illness.More sensitive issues are discussed with the patient alone. Every effort must be made to assure privacy and confidentiality when obtaining personal information from adolescents. Credit must be give to Cohen, who has refined a method for organizing the psychosocial history that was developed by Berman in 1972. This system has been expanded and modified further at the SUNY Upstate Medical University Adolescent Medicine Center in Syracuse. The questions are structured in an easily remembered format that stresses the importance of connecting with adolescents HEADS FIRST (Table 1). This approach emphasizes that “getting into adolescent heads” is just as necessary as performing a physical examination. In many instances, the information obtained during the psychosocial interview is key to elucidating the cause of unexplained fatigue in teenagers.The issues outlined in Table 1 can be addressed with the traditional verbal approach, using the suggested cue words, or by having the patient complete a self-administered personal questionnaire. With either method, the questions should be answered privately and reviewed confidentially with the examiner unless the patient specifically requests otherwise. Most parents respect their adolescents’ need for privacy and appreciate the opportunity for them to receive one-on-one counseling with an experienced health professional.There is considerable overlap in the signs and symptoms caused by the various underlying conditions associated with fatigue. Manifestations are often subtle and should be correlated closely with the overall clinical picture. Thus, clinicians must have a high index of awareness when interpreting historical data, physical findings, and other pertinent information in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue.The onset, severity, and duration of the fatigue as well as any aggravating or relieving factors are explored when taking the history. Particular attention should be paid to any significant changes in the patient’s physical activity level, exercise tolerance, and ability to keep up with peers. Lack of sleep due to getting to bed later, difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime awakening, or getting up earlier in the morning should be considered. A careful review of systems is also essential, with close attention to any constitutional symptoms, such as unexplained fevers, chills, sweating, anorexia, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy, which may suggest the presence of an underlying infection, malignancy, or other inflammatory process. A history of an antecedent “mono-like” illness with negative diagnostic studies is relatively common and suggestive of an infectious cause. However, the significance of this association is unknown.Recent weight gain as well as weight loss should alert the clinician to the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or underlying medical condition. Teenagers who have eating disorders often resort to desperate, even dangerous measures to improve their self-esteem or to enhance their image. Attempts at weight reduction often involve self-injurious behaviors, such as severe caloric deprivation, excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the use of appetite suppressants, laxatives, diuretics, or emetics. Fatigue from rapid fluid shifts or hypokalemia is especially common among bulimics, whose weight may fluctuate dramatically as a result of the frequent episodes of binging and purging. In contrast, patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa usually seem to have boundless energy, even in a state of severe emaciation.Adolescents who engage in competitive activities in which thinness or “making weight” are judged important to success are believed to be particularly susceptible to unhealthy weight control practices. Such activities include body building, cheerleading, dancing (especially ballet), distance running, diving, figure skating, gymnastics, horse racing, modeling, rowing, swimming, weight-class football, and wrestling. As the preoccupation with thinness supersedes the desire to be healthy, physically active young women are at risk for a group of signs and symptoms known as the female athlete triad. Lack of information and the strong desire to win contribute to this condition, which consists of abnormal eating patterns, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. In many instances, these girls become less competitive as they begin to tire more easily and have less stamina.Adolescents should be screened for stress, anxiety, and depression, which frequently are associated with fatigue in this age group. The three most common sources of conflict are problems at home, strained peer relationships, and school-related difficulties. Having a job or not having a job for those in financial need may be an added source of pressure. The practitioner also should look for feelings of sadness, changes in behavior, difficulty concentrating, declining school performance, and other symptoms of depression. Most teens respond openly when asked if they get upset or depressed easily and if they have ever felt like hurting themselves or someone else. Any positive responses can be pursued by asking the patient to “tell me about this.” It must be stressed that adolescents who are actively suicidal or homicidal require immediate intervention by mental health experts, legal authorities, or both.Recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus as well as to other contagious diseases such as hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and tuberculosis should be determined. Asking about pets, tick bites, recent travel, and water supply sometimes is fruitful. A search also should be made for symptoms of cardiac disorders, pulmonary conditions, endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal problems, and renal abnormalities. The menstrual history should be obtained from adolescent girls, looking for amenorrhea, irregular periods, or excessive bleeding, which may suggest the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous miscarriage, recent termination, or threatened abortion. In addition, the patients should be asked about the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications that have a known sedative effect.The clinician also should inquire about symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension, a condition that has been associated with unexplained fatigue in adolescents. Neurally mediated hypotension leads to symptoms after prolonged periods of upright posture, standing in place, standing in the shower, and even sitting. It is especially common when the patient is in a warm environment and after emotionally stressful events. In addition, it may be seen immediately after exercise or soon after eating in some patients as blood flow is shifted to the intestines during the process of digestion.Common symptoms of neurally mediated hypotension include recurrent light-headedness and fainting, which often are associated with postexertional fatigue for 24 to 72 hours. Of particular note, persistent fatigue is a prominent feature of this condition in many adolescents, even if there is no history of fainting. In addition, headaches, myalgias, and mental confusion may occur. The latter frequently is described by patients as being in a “mental fog,” with difficulty concentrating, trouble paying attention, having a hard time staying on task, and having problems finding the right words. Occasionally, shortness of breath with or without chest pain may occur.Any history of recurrent or persistent fever should be documented in the clinician’s office. Unexplained temperature elevation suggests the presence of an underlying infection, neoplasm, or other inflammatory process such as Crohn disease. Hypothermia occurs frequently in patients who have experienced rapid or excessive weight loss. This finding is especially common among adolescents who have eating disorders in whom the low body temperature helps to conserve energy to help compensate for losses from severe caloric deprivation or purging. In addition, hypothyroidism always should be suspected in teenagers who are fatigued, whose temperatures tend to run below normal, and who gain weight in spite of what appear to be appropriate restrictions in dietary intake.Anxiety and stress are the most common causes of tachycardia in the practitioner’s office. They also are important sources of fatigue in adolescents, especially in patients who are not sleeping well. Marijuana is another frequent cause of tachycardia and should be considered in teenagers who appear to be excessively tired or poorly motivated. Stimulant drugs that have been prescribed, purchased over-the-counter, or taken illegally may cause an accelerated heart rate. Fatigue is relatively common when the effects of these drugs begin to wear off. Endocrine abnormalities, including Addison disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism, as well as a number of pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions may cause an elevated pulse rate in patients who are fatigued.Significant weight loss from voluntary caloric restriction is characteristically accompanied by sinus bradycardia, especially in patients who are hypothermic. This is an important physical finding that may help to distinguish adolescents who have eating disorders or those who are simply getting in shape from those who have an underlying organic cause for their weight loss. On the other hand, unexplained weight gain in patients who have bradycardia and fatigue should raise the suspicion of hypothyroidism. A slow pulse rate also may be caused by various medications or street drugs that have a known sedative effect.Abnormalities in the respiratory rate in association with fatigue may indicate a cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic disorder. Variations in the breathing pattern also may be seen with the use, abuse, or withdrawal of many prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or street drugs.As with tachycardia, anxiety and stress are the most common causes of hypertension identified in the examination room. However, the finding of elevated blood pressure in association with fatigue may be due to several important medical conditions, including connective tissue disorders, Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, hyperthyroidism, and renal abnormalities. Routine use, abuse, or withdrawal of over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, or illicit psychoactive substances also may cause hypertension and fatigue.Delayed orthostatic hypotension after prolonged standing also has been described in patients who have unexplained fatigue (discussed in greater detail later in this article). Hypotension also may be noted as an adverse effect of various medications or in relation to abuse of street drugs. Adolescents who have Addison disease are especially susceptible to dehydration with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse, particularly during periods of physical stress. Addison disease always should be suspected in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially when there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.It is very important to plot height routinely throughout the adolescent years. Failure of a patient to progress along the expected parameters should draw immediate attention to the possibility of an underlying systemic process affecting growth and causing unexplained fatigue. In contrast, a normal linear growth velocity all but excludes the presence of an underlying endocrinopathy, such as hypothyroidism or Cushing syndrome, which may cause fatigue in association with obesity. A normal linear growth velocity also lessens the possibility of chronic cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or renal disorders in teenagers who are excessively tired.It is also very important to plot weight throughout adolescence. Patients who have excessive weight gain or loss should be evaluated carefully for the possibility of a nutritional disorder, psychosocial problem, or medical condition. Poor weight gain over time also may be a subtle manifestation of a serious underlying illness, such as inflammatory bowel disease, especially in adolescents who have an unexplained low energy level.The examiner’s first impression about the patient’s overall well-being can be very insightful. Does the patient look ill or well? Does the patient seem to be depressed, anxious, or stressed? Does the patient seem to be adequately nourished?The skin may serve as a window to underlying systemic causes of fatigue in adolescents. Jaundice suggests the presence of hepatitis or hemolysis. A yellow cast to the skin due to hypercarotenemia may be seen in patients who have anorexia nervosa and ingest large amounts of yellow-orange fruits and vegetables. This is a benign physical finding that resembles icterus, but the sclera are not involved. It should prompt the clinician to consider the possibility of an eating disorder that may be otherwise unrecognized.Cyanosis may indicate the presence of a significant abnormality in the cardiovascular or pulmonary system, especially when digital clubbing also is present. The findings may be extremely subtle and only detectable by meticulous examination. A patient of mine had a somewhat sallow appearance. He was tired all the time, but was otherwise totally asymptomatic. During the consultation, he had bounding pulses that eventually led to the diagnosis of a large pulmonary arteriovenous malformation as the cause of symptoms.Pallor usually is associated with iron deficiency anemia resulting from inadequate dietary intake, rapid growth, or blood loss. The latter is especially common in adolescent girls who are having heavy menstrual periods. However, many other important causes of anemia must be considered in this age group, including chronic inflammation, hemolysis, malignancy, and vitamin B12 deficiency, the latter especially in those who are on a vegan diet. Fatigue is a relatively late manifestation of anemia and usually is noted only in moderate-to-severe anemia that has developed over time. Pallor also may be a sign of anxiety, abuse of psychoactive drugs, and the allergic tension fatigue syndrome.Generalized hyperpigmentation may be seen in patients who have fatigue associated with Addison disease. A clue to this diagnosis is involvement of the unexposed areas of skin as well as accentuation of the hyperpigmentation over the axillae, nipples, umbilicus, genitalia, or extensor surfaces of the joints. The clinician also should look carefully at the dorsum of the hands for evidence of superficial ulcerations, calluses, or scars in patients who have bulimia. This is known as Russell sign and is caused by using the fingers to induce vomiting in an effort to control weight. Many patients who have bulimia suffer from fatigue because of fluid or electrolyte imbalance as well as associated depression. Other signs of self-mutilation, such as cuts, scars, scratches, burns, and carved-out tatoos, may be seen in patients suffering from anxiety, depression, and poor self-esteem.A number of skin findings may provide insight into the presence of an underlying connective tissue disease, infectious process, or other inflammatory condition that could cause fatigue in adolescents. A butterfly or discoid rash and photosensitivity are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Flushed cheeks followed by the appearance of a lacy, reticulated rash over the trunk and extremities are found in Fifth disease, which may cause persistent fatigue in teenagers. An evanescent, salmon-colored rash that has irregular borders or serpiginous margins is seen in patients who have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and frequently is accompanied by fever. Subcutaneous nodules also may occur with this condition and are located near the olecranon process, on the dorsal aspect of the hands or knees, near the ears, and over pressure areas such as the scapulae, sacrum, buttocks, and heels. These nodules are usually nontender. In contrast, erythema nodosum is characterized by exquisitely tender, erythematous nodular lesions over the extensor surfaces of the extremities, especially on the pretibial surface of the legs. These lesions frequently recur and are associated with many inflammatory disorders that cause fatigue.Raynaud phenomenon, with characteristic color changes of the fingers and toes, should raise suspicion of a connective tissue disease or other underlying cause. Nailbed capillary changes with dilation and tortuosity of the vessels may be a very subtle finding in patients who have collagen vascular diseases. Cutaneous sclerosis, especially of the digits and face, is associated with scleroderma. In addition, an erythematous, purplish discoloration of the eyelids, forehead, cheeks, temples, dorsal interphalangeal joints, and extensor surfaces of the extremities suggests dermatomyositis.The presence of “allergic shiners” or a bluish discoloration under the eyes often is seen with sinusitis as well as with the allergic tension fatigue syndrome. Injection of the bulbar conjunctivae is common among those who use marijuana. Sjögren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder of unknown cause characterized by dry eyes, xerostomia, salivary gland enlargement, and a high incidence of connective tissue disease. Evidence of iritis or uveitis suggests the presence of a connective tissue disorder or other underlying inflammatory process, such as inflammatory bowel disease.Several oral findings have been noted in patients who have eating disorders, including enamel erosion or caries, particularly over the inner aspect of the upper teeth. This finding probably is related to repeated exposure to gastric contents following self-induced vomiting. Swelling of the parotid and submandibular salivary glands also has been described in those who have bulimia. Enlargement of the submandibular glands may be especially difficult to distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the anterior cervical region. In most instances, the salivary tissue has a softer consistency than the enlarged nodes, but there may be considerable overlap. Infection or other causes of inflammation in the salivary glands also may be associated with fatigue.Evidence of stomatitis, gingivitis, or glossitis in teenagers who are excessively tired may indicate an underlying systemic process. Recurrent mouth ulcers, especially if they are unusually severe or recalcitrant to therapy, are relatively common in Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis. Behçet syndrome is a rare multisystem vasculitis characterized by the triad of recurrent oral ulcers, iridocyclitis, and recurrent ulcers of the external genitalia as well as a variety of other findings that may be accompanied by fatigue. In addition, hyperpigmentation of the gums is seen with Addison disease.The adolescent’s strength should be assessed to differentiate conditions that are associated with muscular weakness from other causes of fatigue. Muscular dystrophy always must be considered. Patients who have myasthenia gravis often experience weakness only late in the day or after physical activity. The clinician should search for other signs of myasthenia gravis that sometimes are subtle, including evidence of ptosis, weakness of the extraocular muscles, and dysphagia. The diminished strength noted in dermatomyositis may be generalized, but it is predominantly proximal, with involvement of the limb girdles and anterior flexors.Objective evidence of arthritis strongly supports an organic cause for the fatigue, such as connective tissue disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infection, or neoplasm. Localized bone pain or tenderness to direct palpation may be associated with anatomic lesions, both benign and malignant. Unexplained bone pain that awakens the patient at night is especially concerning for leukemia or similar invasive processes. Clubbing of the fingers or toes suggests the possibility of chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or liver disease.A careful neurologic examination should be performed to help exclude rare causes of fatigue in adolescents, such as multiple sclerosis. The Chiari malformation also may be associated with subtle neurologic signs in association with fatigue. I recently had a patient in whom the cerebellar tonsils protruded into the spinal canal and compressed the nerves innervating the palate. The floppy palatal tissue resulted in obstructive sleep apnea, and the patient awakened unrefreshed in the morning. The family sought medical attention after the teachers complained that the girl had been falling asleep in class. A decompression procedure was performed by neurosurgery, and the girl’s fatigue resolved completely.Facial tenderness suggests the presence of sinusitis, although this finding often is absent in this condition. Persistent lymphadenopathy may be seen with infection, malignancy, connective tissue disease, or other inflammatory processes. The thyroid gland should be palpated for any enlargement or nodules. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may be associated with fatigue. The lungs, heart, and abdomen should be assessed carefully for any abnormalities that may provide a clue to the diagnosis. The costovertebral angles should be palpated for any tenderness that may suggest pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis, or other renal abnormality. In addition, patients who have generalized ligamentous laxity frequently experience vague musculoskeletal pain and are tired, especially late in the day. Finally, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered in adolescent girls and a pelvic examination performed when indicated.The differential diagnosis of fatigue is extensive and includes numerous organic disorders as well as many psychosocial-medical conditions (Table 2). Sometimes a combination of factors contributes to the fatigue, especially when it is unduly prolonged. It is relatively common for an initial medical illness to take on features of a psychiatric condition as the process evolves. Psychologic issues may emerge as the primary agenda or develop as a consequence of an organic illness. A psychiatric diagnosis should not be assigned solely by the process of exclusion; the appropriate diagnostic criteria must be met before such a diagnosis is made.Symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression may be especially difficult to sort out in adolescents who are fatigued. Failure to attend school may compound an already difficult situation by perpetuating progressive absenteeism. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that masked school avoidance may be contributing to the fatigue. The hyperventilation syndrome may present with fatigue in association with difficulty breathing, chest pain, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, and numbness or tingling of the extremities. In addition, fatigue may be a sign of certain eating disorders, especially bulimia and obesity, which frequently are accompanied by poor self-esteem, feelings of guilt, and depression. Patients who have the purely restrictive form of anorexia nervosa typically do not tire easily unless they are moribund or the weight loss has been rapid.Clinicians always should consider the possibility of Addison disease in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue, especially if there is associated weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. There usually is generalized hyperpigmentation with involvement of unexposed surfaces as well as accentuation in areas of predilection, as described earlier. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia are useful diagnostic features, but are not always present. The most definitive diagnostic test is the ACTH stimulation test (described later). It is imperative to consider Addison disease in the differential diagnosis because if it is not recognized and treated, an adrenal crisis may supervene.Many adolescents who have unexplained fatigue begin with a “mono-like” illness that never resolves completely, and all diagnostic testing results are negative. As with acute infectious mononucleosis, these patients often have a history of severe sore throat, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, headaches, nausea, myalgia, and arthralgia with or without evidence of arthritis. Many of the symptoms recur or linger for months in association with the fatigue. In addition, whenever a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is being entertained, the clinician should consider the possibility of infection with Toxoplasma gondii or cytomegalovirus, which may cause similar symptoms.The association between orthostatic blood pressure changes and prolonged fatigue was described by Streeten and Anderson in 1992, who studied seven patients who had lightheadedness, fatigue, “weakness,” and sometimes syncope. Blood pressures were measured every minute with an automated oscillometer while the patients remained standing. There was no fall in blood pressure after standing for a few minutes, which is the endpoint in traditional testing. However, there was a severe fall in blood pressure in all patients after they stood for 13 to 30 minutes, often with syncope or presyncope. Rowe and associates later described four adolescents who had a history of fatigue and underwent tilt-table testing. This procedure induced significant hypotension in all after they were tilted upright for 12 to 23 minutes. Their fatigue improved dramatically after they were treated for orthostatic hypotension.It is not known why patients who have prolonged fatigue develop these cardiovascular changes when they assume the upright posture. When normal individuals stand up, blood pools in the legs, catecholamines increase to compensate for the decreased venous return to the heart, and there is a compensatory increase in heart rate that involves more vigorous contractions. The reduced amount of blood flow to the heart is pumped more efficiently to the vital organs, especially the brain. In contrast, when individuals who have neurally mediated hypotension stand up, there appears to be a “miscommunication” between the heart and the brain. The heart rate slows while the vessels in the arms and legs dilate. As a result, even more blood is taken from the brain, and the patients feel faint. Finally, an abnormal increase in heart rate after prolonged standing has been described in adolescents who have unexplained fatigue. This condition is known as delayed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and it may occur with or without hypotension.In many instances, no diagnostic studies are required after a thorough history and careful physical examination. The costs of investigative studies are high, and any unnecessary testing should be avoided unless specifically indicated. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, the clinician should consider a screening evaluation that includes the baseline tests shown in Table 3.The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes, liver profile, and urinalysis allow rapid assessment of target organ status in response to a systemic illness. Rheumatologic studies help exclude systemic lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases that may present with fatigue. Thyroid studies always should be performed because manifestations of thyroid conditions often are subtle early in the course of the illness. A high morning cortisol level goes against a diagnosis of Addison disease, but the ACTH stimulation test is the definitive test to exclude this condition. In normal individuals, the serum cortisol level increases two- to three-fold 1 hour after intravenous administration of a synthetic ACTH prepa",

      "title": "Nondrowning Asphyxia in Veterinary Forensic Pathology",
      "abstract": "Asphyxia in a forensic context refers to death by rapid cerebral anoxia or hypoxia due to accidental or nonaccidental injury. Death due to nondrowning asphyxia can occur with strangulation, suffocation, and mechanical asphyxia, each of which is categorized based on the mechanism of injury. Individuals dying due to various types of asphyxia may or may not have lesions, and even those lesions that are present may be due to other causes. The interpretation or opinion that death was due to asphyxia requires definitive and compelling evidence from the postmortem examination, death scene, and/or history. Beyond the postmortem examination, pathologists may be faced with questions of forensic importance that revolve around the behavioral and physiological responses in animals subjected to strangulation, suffocation, or mechanical asphyxia to determine if the animal suffered. While there is no prescriptive answer to these questions, it is apparent that, because of physiological and anatomical differences between humans and animals, for some mechanisms of asphyxia, consciousness is maintained for longer periods and the onset of death is later in animals than that described for people. Veterinary pathologists must be cognizant that direct extrapolation from the medical forensic literature to animals may be incorrect. This article reviews the terminology, classification, mechanisms, and lesions associated with asphyxial deaths in companion animals and highlights significant comparative differences of the response to various types of asphyxia in animals and people.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral nerve damage caused by trauma, surgery, or some diseases is common in clinical practice and may be accompanied by the development of neuropathic pain. Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms. They involve produce local and systemic signal pain cytokines, disturbances in the modulation of sensory flows, peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter imbalance, changes in gene expression and implicate of the limbic system and hypothalamus contribute to the modulation of mood and behavior. Options for managing neuropathic pain with nerve damage include a limited number of pharmacological drugs and interventional treatment methods. Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs. For patient’s refractory to pharmacotherapy, neurosurgical decompression and nerve reconstruction and neuromodulation procedures are recommended to relieve neuropathic pain.

Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders.

      "abstract": "درد احساس و تجربه حسی ناخوشایند می باشد که در نتیجه یک آسیب بالقوه و بالفعل بوجود می آید و کنترل آن به قدری مهم است که انجمن درد آمریکا برای تأکید بیشتر بر درد و کنترل آن، از درد بعنوان پنجمین علامت حیاتی نامبرده است. تقریبا همه انسانها تجربه دردهای متوسط تا شدید را داشته اند و بیشتر اوقات به دنبال انجام پروسیجرهای جراحی، شرایط پزشکی و یا تروما، این تجربه اتفاق افتاده است. وقتی درد و رنج در یک موقعیت بالینی مشخص می گردد، دنبال کردن و رفع آن به عنوان یک هدف و وظیفه بر عهده پرسنل سیستم بهداشتی درمانی می باشد. از این رو درد و درمان آن یک اولویت درمانی است. درد بر تمام افراد با هر سن، جنس، نژاد و طبقه اجتماعی و اقتصادی تأثیرگذار است و درد درمان نشده می تواند بر سیستم های مختلف بدن اثر منفی گذاشته و منجر به عوارض فراوانی گردد. افزایش سطح سرمی کورتیزول، نوراپی نفرین و رنین آنژویوتانسیون، افزایش قند خون، کاهش انسولین، بروز اضطراب، اثرات قلبی مثل ایسکیمی، دیس ریتمی، افزایش نبض، افزایش بار قلبی، افزایش مصرف اکسیژن، افزایش انعقادپذیری خون، افزایش فشار خون بخصوص در بیماران با صدمات سر، کاهش اکسیژن خون، افزایش حجم مایعات بدن، کاهش پتاسیم خون، خستگی، گرفتگی عضلانی، کاهش عملکرد سیستم ایمنی، کاهش قدرت ترمیم زخم و غیره، از جمله عوارض نامطلوب درد می باشند. همچنین عدم درمان دردهای حاد نیز منجر به تحمل دردهای غیرضروری، افزایش طول مدت بستری، افزایش هزینه های پزشکی و احتمال پیشرفت و تبدیل شدن درد حاد به درد مزمن می شود. چنانچه بار اقتصادی عدم درمان درد در آمریکا حدود 100 میلیارد دلار در سال برآورد شده است. درد شکایت بسیار شایعی بوده و بخش قابل توجهی از علل تماس بیماران با سیستم اورژانس پیش بیمارستانی را شامل شده و همچنین در مصدومان و بیماران ترومایی معمولا وجود دارد. نتایج مطالعات نشان می دهد که بین 20 الی 31 درصد بیماران منتقل شده با آمبولانس دارای درد متوسط و شدید بوده اند. همچنین درد با شیوع 52 الی 86 درصد در اورژانس ها یکی از موضوعات اصلی بهداشتی درمانی کشورهای مختلف می باشد. پرسنل اورژانس پیش بیمارستانی نیز اولین اعضای کادر درمانی هستند که در بلایا و سوانح با این بیماران مواجه شده و بیشتر در معرض درد و رنج بیماران قرار دارند. علیرغم رشد کمی پایگاههای فوریتهای پزشکی کشور ایران به بیش از 1900 پایگاه در سراسر کشور، مشاهدات پژوهشگر و شواهد و دستورالعمل های موجود در اورژانس پیش بیمارستانی 115 ایران، نشان دهنده عدم بکارگیری کافی داروهای ضد درد، علی الخصوص ضد دردهای اپیوئیدی به عنوان راهکاری برای کاهش درد بیماران و مصدومان در آمبولانس های فوریتهای پزشکی 115 می باشد. برخی مطالعات ذکر می کنند نزدیک به یک سوم بیماران پیش بیمارستانی و بیش از 80 درصد بیماران دارای شکستگی درد متوسط تا شدید را گزارش می کنند و از طرفی تأثیر مثبت کاربرد مسکن ها در مناطقی که بکار رفته به وضوح بر اکثریت بیماران نشان داده شده است. به نظر می آید که کاربرد داروهای ضد درد در فوریتهای پیش بیمارستانی مبحث بسیار مهمی می باشد و محققان بیان می کنند که مدیریت مناسب درد یک اصل مهم در اقدامات پیش بیمارستانی و خدمت رسانی به بیماران می باشد و مسکن های مخدر نظیر مورفین و فنتالین جایگاه ویژه ای در دستورالعمل های اورژانس پیش بیمارستانی برخی کشورهای پیشرفته در فوریتهای پزشکی بعنوان درمان دردهای حاد ترومایی و غیرترومایی و به ویژه درد قفسه سینه مربوط به بیماری های قلبی دارند. با نگاهی به مطالب پیشگفت در مورد اهمیت درد و درمان آن به خصوص اهمیت درمان درد در تروما و بیماری های ایسکمیک قلبی، شیوع بالای درد در مأموریت های پیش بیمارستانی، شدت درد و نوع ماموریت های پیش بیمارستانی که اکثرا با درد همراه می باشند، هزینه های بالای عدم درمان درد و نیاز مبرم به استفاده از مسکن در تروما و بیماری های ایسکمیک قلبی، آیا زمان آن نرسیده است که فکری به حال درمان مؤثر و علمی تر درد در فوریت های پزشکی گردد؟ آیا بهتر نیست در کنار این همه امکانات که بر بالین بیمار مهیا کرده ایم، چند نوع داروی ضد درد مسکن و مخدر حداقل برای بیماری های ایسکمیک قلبی و یا ترومای شدید نیز در نظر گرفته شود؟ هرچند نتایج مطالعه ای که در خوزستان انجام شد نشان داد که پرسنل فوریتهای پزشکی 115 از نظر اطلاعات و محاسبات دارویی بسیار ضعیف می باشند. بعضا مطالعاتی نیز بیان کرده اند که ممکن است دوزاژ دارویی و کاربرد داروهای مخدر درست انجام نگردد و یا بعضا ممکن است از داروهای مخدر سوء استفاده شود، اما همه اینها دلیل قانع کننده ای برای عدم کاربرد این داروها نمی باشد و می توان با ارایه راهکارهای بهتر نظیر آموزش بیشتر و بهتر پرسنل فوریتهای پزشکی، ایجاد پروتکل های آفلاین و آنلاین و برنامه های مثمر ثمر در جهت جلوگیری از سوء استفاده از داروهای مسکن بطور مؤثری از این دارو در فوریتهای پزشکی 115 استفاده نمود . از این رو مجدد متذکر می شویم که این اولویت درمانی نباید به هیچ دلیل نادیده گرفته شود.",

      "title": "12. IMPAIRED PERCEPTION OF ONE’S OWN BODY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: NEW EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE",
      "abstract": "Self-disturbances in schizophrenia include symptoms such as depersonalization, fuzzy demarcation between one’s own body and others, feelings of body disintegration or dislocation, the feeling of a distance between oneself and the world, and experiences of time fragmentation or disappearance. These are only a few examples of symptoms related to bodily or ‘minimal’ self-disturbances, which have been described both in patients with prodromal symptoms and chronic schizophrenia. Contrary to agency disorders, the listed symptoms do not imply voluntary actions, and may occur even when one stands still. They are non-verbal manifestations by definition, and thus hard to describe for the patients. Recent phenomenological developments have nonetheless brought these symptoms back to the forefront. However, compared to the exploration of agency disorders, experimental evidence for disorders of body self-perception is still scarce. The aim of the symposium is to bring together the work of four teams that have independently explored this question with distinct experimental psychology approaches. The sense of bodily self and the ability to see the world from one’s own first-person perspective relies on the integration of both interoceptive and exteroceptive information. Being ‘immersed in the world’, the impression of being in direct contact with the environment, relies on the ability to correctly attribute and integrate information from the outer world relative to oneself, and to synchronize oneself with the environment. It is precisely these abilities that are explored by studying the processing of interoceptive and multisensory information or time prediction, and the sensitivity to asynchronies. Lénie Torregrossa explores interoceptive signals in patients with schizophrenia by looking at their ability to accurately report heartbeats, and to precisely localize emotions in their body. Both abilities are affected in patients, and the results represent a unique insight in the alteration of how patients feel their own body. Anne Giersch explores time disorders and shows behavioral and EEG results suggesting that instead of reaching a sense of time continuity, patients with schizophrenia are abnormally sensitive to short asynchronies. She argues that such difficulties may affect the flow of sensory signals, and thus the bodily self. Neeltje van Haren explores body self-perception disorders using the rubber hand illusion, which is based on visuo-tactile stimulation. Patients report that the rubber hand feels like their own hand more than controls, reflecting the fragility of the patients’ body boundaries. Interestingly, agency disorders are explored in parallel, and the results allow for discussion of the relative roles of sensorimotor input vs. the cognitive body representation in sensitivity to the illusion. Roy Salomon induces a feeling of presence experimentally, and shows it affects the ability of first episode patients to distinguish between their own voice and the voice of another person. This deficit correlates with resting-state fMRI dysconnectivity in the cortical systems of bodily self-representations. Voice misattributions have been shown in people with auditory hallucinations, these results thus relate body ownership impairments with agency disorders. The presentations, taking different perspectives, provide complementary descriptions of body self-perception disorders and of their underlying mechanisms. The discussant (Steve Silverstein) will integrate these data on body self-perception disorders in schizophrenia and discuss potential mechanistic interpretations and therapeutic implications.",

Acute fatigue is a normal condition that disappears after a period of rest; in contrast, chronic fatigue does not disappear after an ordinary rest. Chronic fatigue impairs daily activities and contributes to various medical conditions and death. In addition, many people complain of chronic fatigue. It would thus be of great value to clarify the mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue and to develop efficient treatment methods to overcome it. Here, we review data primarily from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging experiments related to the neural mechanisms underlying chronic fatigue. We propose that repetitive and prolonged overwork and/or stress cause neural damage of a facilitation system, as well as central sensitization and classical conditioning of an inhibition system. We also propose a new treatment strategy for chronic fatigue on the basis of its underlying neural mechanisms.",

Skeptics say that such claims can be accounted for by possible misdiagnosis, uncritical reportage, placebo response, and coincident natural improvement. Their a priori objection is that subjective intention in one person cannot, of itself, affect the physiology and/or mental processes of another person. This a priori objection becomes invalid if experimental evidence, using simultaneous electroencephalographic recordings from two or more brains, has demonstrated that direct brain-to-brain communication can occur. Evidence that something very unusual is occurring during the healing transaction comes from recordings of anomalous electrical and magnetic fields generated by healers when they are in the intention-to-heal mindset.",

The diagnosis overlaps with other personality disorders, disturbances of mood and intermittent abnormal behavior. As almost all behavior likely to lead to consultation with mental health professionals is included among the elements of personality disorder, it is not surprising that it is almost the most common condition seen by specialists in the field. An attempt is made to define the borders of the condition in this review. It is concluded that these are so far‐reaching that they negate the notion that borderline conditions are personality disorders. It is argued that the borderline state is a coaxial diagnosis of personality and mental state disorder and to continue to describe the concept as a personality disorder is wrong and misleading.",

      "title": "Exploring Care and Recovery for Individuals With Post-traumatic Stress Disorder: A Scoping Review",
      "abstract": "Most people experience trauma at some point in their lives. The sources of trauma can include accidents, natural disasters, physical or sexual assault, combat, torture, or the death of a loved one. Experiencing or witnessing any of these, or other terrifying events, may make one susceptible to developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a trauma- and stressor-related mental health condition. The common symptoms and consequences of PTSD include intrusive and distressing thoughts, memories, or flashbacks related to the traumatic event; avoidance of situations, people, or activities that remind one of the traumatic event; irritability, sleep difficulties, or hypervigilance; feelings of guilt, shame, or fear; substance use; strains on relationships; and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. These consequences can have devastating effects on the individual and their family members, friends, co-workers, peers, and communities. Effectively treating PTSD, therefore, is critical not only for the individual but also for the well-being of families, communities, and society at large. However, while treatments for PTSD exist, effectively treating patients with PTSD remains elusive. Further, despite the recognition that people’s experiences are essential in understanding PTSD and provide valuable insights into what interventions are effective and how they impact recovery, patient perspectives and experiences of care and recovery have not been well-explored. We conducted a scoping review to address the following question: what is known about the experiences and perspectives of care and recovery for individuals with PTSD? We searched the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Embase, American Psychological Association’s (APA) PsycInfo, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PTSDPubs, and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed and grey literature that used qualitative methods to report on the recovery or care experiences of adults with lived experiences of PTSD. We extracted information about study objectives, study characteristics, and key findings; reported summary statistics; and performed content and thematic analyses. We identified 14 relevant studies that provide insight into the participants’ lived experiences and perspectives of PTSD care and recovery. Though limited, the body of literature sheds light on critical themes and processes in the journey of care of PTSD, which we organized into four overarching categories: pre-treatment understanding and experiences of PTSD, the experience of care or treatment, the importance of relationships and social support, and expanding the understandings of recovery. Living with and healing from PTSD are a unique and individualized human experience of developing and redeveloping relationships with oneself, with others, and with society. The recommendations for practice include educating and establishing well-informed support networks for individuals with PTSD, training healthcare practitioners in all aspects of formal and informal PTSD treatment and care needs, ensuring a continuum of care, and understanding the human experience of PTSD.",

      "title": "Towards a genuinely medical model for psychiatric nosology",
      "abstract": "Psychiatric nosology is widely criticized, but solutions are proving elusive. Planned revisions of diagnostic criteria will not resolve heterogeneity, comorbidity, fuzzy boundaries between normal and pathological, and lack of specific biomarkers. Concern about these difficulties reflects a narrow model that assumes most mental disorders should be defined by their etiologies. A more genuinely medical model uses understanding of normal function to categorize pathologies. For instance, understanding the function of a cough guides the search for problems causing it, and decisions about when it is expressed abnormally. Understanding the functions of emotions is a foundation missing from decisions about emotional disorders. The broader medical model used by the rest of medicine also recognizes syndromes defined by failures of functional systems or failures of feedback control. Such medical syndromes are similar to many mental diagnoses in their multiple causes, blurry boundaries, and nonspecific biomarkers. Dissatisfaction with psychiatric nosology may best be alleviated, not by new diagnostic criteria and categories, but by more realistic acknowledgment of the untidy landscape of mental and other medical disorders.",

      "title": "A View of the violence contained in chronic fatigue syndrome",
      "abstract": "In this paper I ask whether there might be any one particular psychopathology likely to be linked specifically with the physical illness known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and whether CFS/ME aids and abets and ‘fits’ an original mental state. I think the question cannot yet be answered. However it is my hypothesis that in some personality structures the onset of CFS/ME following a physical illness exacerbates negativity and is an aspect of ordinary depression where there is a lowering of energy levels and a loss of zest for life, or it may reveal the pathological aspect of unresolved rage. Depending on the degree of pathological disturbance, working with and through the rage may or may not result in a resolution of the symptoms of ME. In this paper I consider some of the problems in the transference and countertransference relationship, which make it extremely difficult to separate out reality from phantasy. There is then the further problem of the denial of the psyche by the patient as part of the violence inherent in the illness. One case is presented, an example of ME in a borderline male patient in whom resolution could not be achieved.",

It is similar to the “pressed state of mind——psycho-pressure syndrome” of psychopathology in appearance. The phenomenon arises from the activation of the physiological and psychological anxiety-preventing mechanism by certain behaviors. Its cultural causes may be the elevation of the superego or the failure of choice. Consequently, the individual experiences the cultural transformation and conflict both psychologically and pathologically.",

      "title": "What is Traumatization? : A Critical Psychological Critique and Reformulation",
      "abstract": "Inspired by critical psychology this article explores and challenges two central issues in psychology: The use of diagnoses and that of trauma. These concepts - and related practices - are not as straight-forward as is often assumed in mainstream psychology. On the contrary, they have complex and far-reaching problematic implications for our understanding of agency, difficulties, dilemmas and suffering of concrete subjects, as well as for our practices. This article discusses the conceptualisation of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is in widespread use in most countries. Using this diagnosis as an example, some problems concerning diagnoses in general are introduced. Drawing on a study of women exposed to sexualised coercion, ‘symptoms’ of PTSD are reinterpreted. Trauma is understood as processes of a personal and overpowering sense of loss of control in specific times and places, and thus as embedded in the conduct of everyday lives. ‘Symptoms’ of PTSD are therefore reinterpreted as aspects of overpowering and violent personal meanings and as situated consequences of loss of control. Violent experiences and their consequences do not simply provoke ‘reactions’, as is assumed in the use of the diagnosis. As a result, its description of recurring thoughts and feelings concerning ‘traumatising events’ may be understood as recurring specific and personal attempts at dealing with, and learning from, violent loss of control.",

      "abstract": "As there are few or no objective signs of disease and standard laboratory tests and imaging studies often appear normal, chronic post-traumatic headache (CPTH) is frequently disrespected. Confusion about its legitimacy began with its initial recognition in the mid-19th century, followed by modern attempts to establish its criteria in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). There are no distinct clinical features of CPTH. Most resemble tension-type headache, but symptoms of migraine and, rarely, of other primary headaches may occur. CPTH is often associated with the post-concussion/post-traumatic stress syndrome. Anatomic, physiologic, psychologic, socioeconomic, and cultural factors may contribute to the development of CPTH. Changes in diffusion tensor imaging, a refinement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been correlated with subtle cognitive abnormalities in neuropsychologic tests of patients after mild traumatic brain injury. These studies and others may prove to be biologic markers for headache and other symptoms of the post-concussion syndrome. The therapy of CPTH is similar to that of the phenotypically primary headaches. Avoidance of analgesic overuse, prophylactic medications, and, in particular, non-pharmacologic modalities are the basic elements. Active participation by patients in headache management and an empathetic physician are essential.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies in stroke patients suggest that the left frontal anterior region may be strategic for depression. However, these findings could not always be replicated. Some authors even deny any etiological contribution of lesion location to depression. The predominant role of the right hemisphere in secondary mania is well recognized. In disorders such as apathy, anxiety, catastrophe reactions and pathological laughing and crying, further studies are needed to determine the potential clinico-topographic correlations. Affective disorders are important to consider in stroke patients, since they may influence neurological recovery and may be responsive to treatment. Remarkable features of emotional behavior, such as disinhibition, denial, indifference, overt sadness and aggressiveness, are not rare during the acute phase of stroke and might be overlooked if not searched for systematically with appropriately designed scales. Some of these early behaviors, such as denial, may relate to the late development of depression, anxiety and other disorders. Systematic studies on large samples of patients may allow to establish which of these acute emotional behavioral changes are markers for the delayed development of mood disorders.",

      "title": "SOME BIOCHEMICAL IMPLICATIONS IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 0.6 to 1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by a deficit in communication and social interaction, and is associated with restricted and repetitive behavior patterns. Stereotypes include inflexible adhesion to specific non-functional routines and rituals and a persistent concern with parts of objects rather than the object as a whole. Up to the present time, there are no specific tests that permit a laboratory diagnosis of the disorder to be carried out, and the syndrome is confirmed by clinical observation in the first 36 months of the patient’s life. Clinical manifestations such as epilepsy, mental retardation, sleep disorders, hyperactivity, irritability and auto- and heteroaggressiveness may alter the patient’s prognosis. Around 50% of children with ASD fulfill the criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) associated with autism appear to indicate a distinct phenotype requiring specific therapeutic measures. ASD is not a discrete nosological entity but, rather, a multifactorial syndrome associated with different phenotypic and biological presentations. Various disorders such as pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to ASD, not only insofar as causality is concerned but also with respect to their role in aggravating the disease. Other associated disorders include lesions in physiological processes such as the redox metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and enzymatic regulation of essential metabolites. Currently, studies on direct and indirect markers of mitochondrial metabolism associated with anomalies found in the brain of these patients point to the possibility of these markers being used as tools with which to reach a diagnosis that would be laboratory based rather than merely clinical.",

However, the subject is poorly covered in medical education. A major consequence is that the manifestations of the many sleep disorders now identified are likely to be misinterpreted as other clinical conditions of a physical or psychological nature, especially neurological or psychiatric disorders. To illustrate this problem, examples are provided of the various possible causes of sleep loss, poor quality sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness and episodes of disturbed behaviour at night (parasomnias). All of these sleep disorders can adversely affect mental state and behaviour, daytime performance or physical health, the true cause of which needs to be recognised by clinicians to ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. As conventional history taking in neurology and psychiatry pays little attention to sleep and its possible disorders, suggestions are made concerning the enquiries that could be included in history taking schedules to increase the likelihood that sleep disorders will be correctly identified.",

Personality, cognitive functions, α 2 and imidazoline binding, sensitivity to inducement of panic attacks, relative hypothyroidism, and some but not all serotonergic functions of women with dysphoric PMS differ from those with no PMS, and also differ during a non‐symptomatic phase of the cycle. It is suggested that premenstrual symptoms are an expression of vulnerability traits that might surface in response to a trigger. Such traits are probably diverse, and the nature of the symptoms might depend upon the underlying trait. It is postulated that some vulnerability traits to specific premenstrual syndromes might also be vulnerability traits to depression or anxiety in general.",

      "abstract": "The present study constitutes a brief literature overview, in which the term of clinical perfectionism, its etiopathology, its assessment and its relation to psychopathology, as well as the therapeutic interventions based on the Cognitive Behavioral Model are discussed. According to Frost, perfectionism is associated with one's desire to achieve the greatest degree of performance and it is accompanied by an extremely strict evaluation of that particular performance. The relationship with oneself as well as the relationship with others are both characterised by high standards and demands which tend to exhaust one individual and dramatically toughen the development of proximity with the others. Perfectionism, as a personality trait, presents functional and dysfunctional elements for a person. Dysfunctional, clinical perfectionism -a term recently coined by researchers- has been linked to a number of disorders, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders -anorexia and bulimia nervosa- depression and personality disorders. From a perfectionist's point of view, perfection exists and its attaintment is feasible. The existence of a particularly high and often unrealistic goal can lead the person to severe disappointment when this specific goal is not finally reached. A person with functional perfectionism is possible to set another, more achievable, goal next time, while a person with clinical perfectionism will interpret this failure as a sign of personal inadequacy and will either make another attempt to reach the same goal or will abandon the effort altogether. A sense of weakness and subsequent negative automatic thoughts are the aftermath of both the first and the second choice. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy focuses on the realisation that clinical perfectionism is undesirable, on the dispute of negative automatic thoughts and on the replacement of unfunctional cognitive schemas with other, more functional ones. In the therapeutic process, one individual can learn how to set specific and realistic goals, to focus on the process of a task instead of its result, to organise activities in a hierarchy depending on their significance and, finally, to feel fulfilled even if they have not brought a task to completion. It is a fact that the core schemas of clinical perfectionism are characterised by rigidity due to the excessive number of secondary benefits they provide for one person. The exploration of those benefits and the discovery of alternative sources of fulfillment are areas of therapeutic work.",

This is mainly due to the neurobiological and endocrine response because when faced with a stressful stimulus, a deregulated release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines is generated, altering the normal physiology of the organism. Gastrointestinal disorders are mainly due to goblet cell dysfunction, resulting in intestinal hyperpermeability, inflammation and infection. Changes at the immune level lead to an increase in inflammatory responses but a decrease in the protective activities of the immune system. Finally, cardiovascular conditions include atherosclerosis, increased blood pressure and stroke. Conclusion: Psychological stress can induce real physiological pathologies and, in some cases, fatal ones. Some of the molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies have already been studied and identified. Knowledge of these molecular mechanisms can help clinicians and therapists to improve the treatment and therapy of patients.",

      "abstract": "Presumed toxic exposures have a connotation that can be alarming to any individual; thus, an inferred or assumed toxic trigger leading to myriad, vague symptoms, or complaints is frequently encountered in the outpatient clinic setting. For a toxicological cause to be considered, several factors should be present. Probably, the most important association is a temporal relationship; for example, the peaked therapeutic effect of a drug may be temporally associated with its peak adverse effect. In general, intravenous administration of a drug will elicit an adverse effect in a much shorter time period than oral or transdermal drug administration. Questionnaires can be furnished to assist in biological validity of complaints. Such areas of focus could include demographic characteristics, symptom development, mood states, or hazard exposures. Extensive neuropsychological testing may be indicated; although, even then it may be difficult to identify malingering.",

They are conceptualized as the human psyche’s way of coping with intolerable circumstances—a means of escape to assure survival, no matter what the price. Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is classified by modern American psychiatry within the dissociative disorders, but its traumatic causes are more highly variable than those encountered in more severe dissociative disorders. Not only childhood trauma, but also later severe stress, frightening episodes of other mental illness, and even isolated drug use can precipitate the condition. In some cases of depersonalization disorder, there is even no apparent cause or trigger.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

Studies using retrospective self‐report of sexual attitude and behavior find an incidence of sexual dysfunction ranging from 14–66%. Sexual dysfunction may be more common in partial than in generalized epilepsies. Sexual dysfunction in epilepsy may result from a disturbance in social or psychological factors affecting sexual responsiveness. Alternatively, epileptiform discharges may disrupt the function of structures mediating sexual behavior, particularly the limbic cortex, or alter the release of hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. Antiepileptic drugs modulate hormone release from the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal axis and may have direct inhibitory effects on sexual behavior. Evidence both supports and refutes each of these etiologies in the sexual dysfunction seen with epilepsy. Specific evaluation and treatment protocols for patients with sexual dysfunction are available.",

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Aggressive and Assaultive Behaviour",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Violence and aggression are common in mental health facilities, sometimes with grave consequences[1] warrant the formation of a guideline that addresses these issues. The combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors along with the context and setting of violence makes the task of its prevention and management a complex phenomenon. The intrinsic components mainly consisted of personality features, current serious mental stress, and difficulty in managing anger. On the other hand, extrinsic factors are more diverse and depend not only upon the physical and social context where violence and aggression happen but also on the aggressor's attitude, victim's characteristics, health professional's training and experience, and perceived risk of danger.[2] DEFINITIONS OF VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION Violence and aggression can be defined as a set of activities that may lead to harm to other persons. It can be expressed in actions or words, but the physical damage remains and the purpose is clear.[2] EPIDEMIOLOGY Aggression by patients in psychiatric wards may be a common occurrence. Studies show that 18%-25% of hospitalized patients exhibit violent behavior while in the ward.[3] High occurrence of aggression particularly verbal aggression is also reported by Emergency staff.[4] The association of mental conditions with violence and aggression Contrary to the popular public view that recognized the link between mental health problems (especially serious mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) and violence, the literature on this fact varies and shows mixed results. People with mental health problems are more likely to become victims of violence than perpetrators, and most people do not engage in violence at all.[5] However, a consensus has emerged among researchers that a small fraction of patients have a relationship between mental health issues and violence. Persons with organic brain dysfunction (post-traumatic, posthead injury, and seizure disorder particularly temporal lobe seizures) tend to exhibit violent and aggressive behaviour. The Epidemiological Catchment area study[6] reported a 7.3% of lifetime prevalence of violence within the population who is free from psychiatric issues. On the other hand, the lifetime prevalence of violence was more than double (16.1%) in persons with schizophrenia or major affective disorders and 35% and 43.6% in those with substance use disorders and substance use disorder with comorbid mental health issues, respectively. An association of violence was noticed, in different meta-analyses with Mood disorders, schizophrenia, and other psychosis.[7-9] A huge number of varieties were recognized with an odds ratio between 1 and 7 for schizophrenia in males and between 4 and 27 for females. For bipolar disorder, the odds ratio extended from 2 to 9. Be that as it may, for both disorders a comorbid substance-use disorder expanded the odds ratio up to 3-fold. In the early 20th century, researchers recognized a set of symptoms called threat/control-over-ride symptoms that seemed to be associated with the risk of violence.[10] Threat/control-over-ride symptoms are delusional symptoms that make an individual feel like he is under threat and under the control of external forces. Personal impact of violence and aggression against self and others Staff within the hospital A fraction of the injuries that happen to staff occur while trying to intervene in fights between patients, but staff may also receive injuries by unpredictable assaults made by patients who respond to their psychiatric symptoms or by confrontation while stopping patients from leaving the ward.[11] Sometimes staff also have to physically intercede to halt patients from harming themselves or attempting to take off to the ward, which may lead to aggression. Individual consequences Patients who carry on violence are likely to encounter more accommodation difficulties, diminished social relations, and social support and be more disconnected. As a result, violence can be dangerous for those involved and have a negative impact on quality of life. Relatives, Carers, and Social networks Family members, carers, and close contacts of patients are more likely to be injured when there is a risk of violence exists. On the other hand, in case the patient is living freely, relatives may pull back and stop supporting and visiting him if they frequently face aggressive and abusive behaviour. In hospitals, staff blames a person's illness as the source of hostility, while patients blame illness, interpersonal problems, and the environment equally as sources of aggression.[12] This staff awareness is critical to understanding how staff responds to incidents of violence and the postincident support needed to effectively manage the impact on themselves and patients.[13] Demographic and premorbid factors Histories of aggression, schizophrenia, and recent illicit drug use are associated with aggression while inconclusive evidence for age, gender, and h/o conduct disorder. Causes of aggressive and violent behavior listed in Table 1.Table 1: Causes of aggressive and violent behaviorRISK FACTORS FOR AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Risk factors are characteristics of the patient or their environment and care that make them more likely to behave aggressively. Two types of risk factors: Static risk factors:Historical and remain unchangedExample: Age, sex, family background, and childhood abuse.[14]Dynamic risk factors:Are changeable and hence there is an opportunity for intervention. Examples: Presenting symptoms, alcohol and illicit substance consumption, and compliance issue with treatment.[14] Risk assessment involves identifying risk factors and assessing the likelihood and nature of adverse outcomes. On the other hand, risk management involves methodologies to prevent these negative results from happening or to limit their effect. Some researchers believed that static factors were better suited to assess risk over the long term and dynamic factors for assessing the risk of violence in the short term.[14] VIOLENCE ANDAGGRESSION RISK ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTION Predicting events that are imminent or perceived as imminent is not a trivial task. But, in acute clinical scenarios, it is difficult to perform comprehensive assessments that comprise history and physical and mental status examination in patients with a risk of violence and aggression. Different methods of risk assessment and tool were listed in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.Table 2: Broadly there are three methods to assess riskTable 3: Various violence-related risk assessment toolsVarious places where violence risk may be present Institutional facilities: includes large and small hospitals, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, inpatient/outpatient care facilities, small clinics, and community health facilities. Fieldwork settings: healthcare or social workers who sometimes need to make home visits. Use safety measures in all settings to prevent violence and aggression.[24] MANAGEMENT OF AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE Management of aggressive and violent behavior will depend upon the sensorium and orientation of the patient at the time of the presentation. If the patient is disoriented/delirious then the management would be as per the guidelines of a delirious patient.[25] If he/she is well oriented and has clear sensorium then management will be as follows. Verbal de-escalation Restrictive interventions Pharmacological management VERBAL DE-ESCALATION Process of verbal de-escalation describe in Table 4 RESTRICTIVE INTERVENTION Modifications as per the environment Personal and institutional alarms to be fixed in easily accessible site. Table 4: Verbal De-escalationCommon restrictive interventions include A. Physical Restraint As per section 97 of the Mental Health Care Act 2017, physical restraint should only be used when there is imminent and immediate harm to the person concerned or to others and it should be authorized by a psychiatrist in charge. Salient points to be considered as per the mental health act 2017 for physical restraint: Physical restraint should not be used longer than necessary. Treating psychiatrist or medical officer should be responsible for ensuring the method and nature of the restraint, its justification, and appropriate record. The nominated representative should be informed if restraint is prolonged beyond 24 hours. It should not be used as a punishment method or counter to staff shortage. A person should be placed under restraint at a place where he can cause no harm to him or others and be under regular supervision by medical personnel. All instances should be reported to the mental health board on monthly basis. For further reference, a reader can use specific restraint guidelines for mental health services in India by Raveesh et al.[27] Techniques used for Physical restraint Approach 1 For physical restrain, patient should be lying down on the bed. Both upper and lower extremities should be tied with soft clothes or bandages. Constant monitoring of patients during mechanical restraint is a must. If constant monitoring is not possible, the patient has to be visually observed for at least 15 minutes of restraint time and should be within eyesight. And keep watch at every 10–15 minutes for the remaining hours. Approach 2 In the prone position, both arm and legs should be joint to the bedside. It should be done with cotton bandage.[2] This will allow some free movement of patient during restrain. Physical restraint techniques should be modified as per the patient's condition and physical health.[2] B. Seclusion Seclusion is not permitted in India as per the existing Mental Health Care Act 2017. However, in western guidelines, seclusion is reported as one of the techniques. It is 'the involuntary imprisonment of an individual in a room from which the individual is physically avoided from moving out. Patients were watched each 10 to 15 minutes through a window within the door.[2] One randomized controlled trial[28] reported a low level of evidence that suggests a minimal restrictive care (seclusion) is as effective as a more prohibitive pathway (mechanical restraint). Three reviews[29-31] reported that although staff believes restrictive measures to be a necessary step, this was also associated with the feeling of regret, trauma, and concern about the therapeutic relationship. Advisable Laboratory Investigations As soon as the patient is cooperative or sedated by pharmacological management, the following investigations may be done to rule out comorbid organic conditions or for the planning of pharmacological management. Full Blood Count Liver Function Test Kidney Function Test Blood Glucose level Electrocardiogram Electrolytes Urinary drug screening Brain scan (optional, after clinical judgment) 3. PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT Every individual with aggressive and assaultive behaviour presented with a different set of issues. There is a lack of good scientific literature in the area of medical management in the acute setting for aggressive and assaultive behaviour. Pharmacological management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour should be considered only when other methods of management failed or respond inadequately.[32] Selection of pharmacological treatment for aggressive and assaultive agitation should be based on underlying etiological issues and psychiatric diagnosis. See the overview of pharmacological management of aggression and assaultive behaviour in Figure 1.Figure 1: Outline of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourPsychiatric reasons for the presentation of acute aggressive behavior are due to psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, substance-related issues, conduct disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and personality problems. Certain patient-related and medication-related factors should be kept in mind before planning an effective management plan.[33] Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour shown in Table 5.Table 5: Factors to be considered in the pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour[ 33 , 35 ]A mainstay for pharmacological treatment of aggressive and assaultive behaviour lies in rapid tranquilization in the short term. Search for psychopathology and/or medical reasons and appropriate management of it should be the next step of action.[2] Presentation of such assaultive and aggressive behaviour is also varied in different settings like community, acute and emergency department, psychiatric inpatient setting, or medical setting. The definition of rapid tranquillization is subject to debate. The major goal of treatment is to archive calmness without oversedation of the patient and rapid control of acutely disturbed behaviour.[2,34] However, in the case of acute behavioural disturbance, level of sedation is required to a much deeper extent. The Recent NICE guideline defines rapid tranquilization specific to the parental route, particularly by intramuscular and in the rare case intravenous route. Although this guideline also highlights the use of oral preparations before parental.[2] The general principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviour listed in Table 6.Table 6: Principles of pharmacological management of aggressive and violent behaviourManagement of acute aggressive and violent behaviour No agent preferred over the other. The use of medication is based on various factors as mentioned in Table 5. Use of oral medication must be encouraged before any form of parenteral medicine. But it may depend on the severity of the acute presentation, availability of resources, and patient cooperation. Also, single medication use should be always preferred over a combination of medicines. Summary of some major studies with different medication combinations and their outcome listed in Table 7. A combination of more than one agent leads to develop unnecessary side effects and negative patient experience. The patient's age and hepatic and renal function also consider before prescribing any agent.Table 7: Summary of studies with different medication combinations and their outcome[ 38 - 42 ]A stepwise approach should be considered as shown in the following path [Figure 2] for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviour.[2]Figure 2: Stepwise approach for acute management of aggressive and assaultive behaviourOral and inhaled treatment Research supported the early use of oral medication due to the good efficacy of medications in controlling assaultive and violent behaviour. Patients with mild to moderate levels of agitation may show cooperation in taking oral medication. Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics have been used primarily to treat aggression and violent behavior.[2,36] Benzodiazepine acts through the GABA receptors and it has anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant properties.[33] Oral benzodiazepine is available in various formulations like melt –in mouth, oral disintegrated molecule, and buccal preparations. Oral Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam were used extensively in the past for controlling violent behaviour. Oral benzodiazepine is relatively safe and less associated with respiratory depression compared to its parental preparations. Both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics were used due to their brain-calming effect. Oral mouth-dissolving preparations of Olanzapine, Risperidone (both mouth dissolving and solution base preparation), Haloperidol, and Quetiapine have been used for a long time.[33] Sublingual Asenapine has also shown its effectiveness in managing acute behavioural changes.[33] Recently FDA approved inhaled form of Loxapine for the management of acute violent behaviour associated with schizophrenia and bipolar.[37] But the availability of bronchodilator medication should be ensured due to its serious adverse effect of bronchospasm. Commonly used medication and their adverse reactions are given in Table 8.Table 8: Various medication options available for rapid tranquilization, their dosage and maximum dose in 24 h and waiting interval[ 33 , 36 , 38 ]Parenteral treatment Intramuscular preparations of Olanzapine, Haloperidol, Aripiprazole, Lorazepam, and Diazepam have been used for a long. Research has not shown the parental route has any advantage over the oral route in treatment efficacy but the onset of action is rapid with the parental route. A large observational study shows IM Olanzapine is more effective than all other second-generation antipsychotics. The combination of IM midazolam and IM haloperidol is more effective than IM haloperidol alone.[2] NICE recommends intramuscular lorazepam should always try before haloperidol in case of insufficient information to guide the choice of medication.[2] Partial response to intramuscular lorazepam NICE recommends repeated doses of lorazepam based on considering risks and benefits. But in case of the partial response of intramuscular haloperidol addition of intramuscular promethazine should be tried.[2] Avoid the use of a combination of olanzapine intramuscular preparation with an intramuscular benzodiazepine in case of alcohol use.[38] ECG must be carried out before haloperidol because of the risk of QT prolongation.[2,38] The intravenous route is no longer advised as an initial choice for rapid tranquillization.[2,38] Intravenous midazolam is more closely associated with respiratory depression. Flumazenil should have been kept handy whenever the intravenous injection of benzodiazepine is given.[38] Medication to be consider in various psychological conditions [Table 9] and consideration in case of the special populations mention in Table 10.Table 9: The table shows various psychological conditions and medication to be considered[ 32 , 37 , 43 ]Table 10: Consideration in case of special populations[ 2 , 33 , 38 ]Management of agitation in emergency and consultation liaison specific should refer to specific guidelines by Raveesh et al.[43] Monitoring in case of rapid tranquillization Monitoring of sedation with appropriate tools and rating scales like the Ramsay scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation scale, and Sedation Assessment Tool should be carried out and postsedation documentation about the incident and trying to find out the cause for such behaviour is also an important part in the management of patients.[2] If possible, provide one-to-one nursing and eyesight observation for better management of the condition. Continuous monitoring of vital signs is as mentioned follows [Table 11].Table 11: Physical health monitoring in case of rapid tranquillizationFrequent monitoring of vitals every 15-20 min should be ideally carried out for high-risk patients.[2] One should also need to be watchful for acute side effects of antipsychotic medicines like Acute Dystonia, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, Acute Confusional State, Hypotension, Irregular Heart rates, and Respiratory Depression due to benzodiazepine.[38,44] Also staff should be trained in providing basic life-saving resuscitation and use of flumazenil in case of severe respiratory depression. Further investigations are required before giving a repeating dosage of medications and rule-out medical causes and medical comorbidities. If the patient is calm and cooperative for mental status examination, then an attempt should be made for the same. Uncooperative violent and aggressive patient at home For emergencies, medical treatment for mental illness may be provided by a registered medical practitioner to a person with mental illness either at a health establishment or in the community with the informed consent of a nominated representative. A nominated representative should be available at the time of evaluation. An emergency is to be considered and needs immediate intervention to prevent: Death or irreversible harm to the health of a person; Person inflicting serious harm to himself or to others; and Person causing serious damage to property belonging to himself or to others where such behavior is believed to flow directly from the person's mental illness. For the purpose of treatment, only the situations mentioned above can be considered. Emergency treatment duration is to be considered up to 72 hours from the initial evaluation by a registered medical practitioner/psychiatrist. Emergency treatment includes transportation of a person with mental illness to the nearest mental healthcare establishment for assessment and management If management at home is not possible or unaffordable relatives or caregivers of such patients should approach the nearest police station for escorting him/her to the nearest psychiatric care facility for management. Management of chronic aggressive and assaultive behaviour In some cases, aggressive and assaultive behaviour may persist for a longer duration. The use of specific medication should be required to control future behaviour. Use of a particular medication is based on consideration of clinical features and mechanism of action of the medication. Since no medication has been approved for this specific indication.[45] The clinician must have to consider other groups of medication apart from antipsychotics and benzodiazepine (i.e., mood stabilizing antiepileptics, antidepressants). The clinician should also try to diagnose underlying psychopathology in-depth and consider substance misuse and personality-related problems in the case of chronic aggressive behaviour. Prolonged use of antipsychotics in the elderly population should be considered against the risks and benefits.[45] Workplace violence in psychiatry Victims of workplace violence subsequently may develop psychological trauma, work avoidance, guilt feeling, powerlessness, and changes in relationships. A follow-up program for addressing these abovementioned responses may be needed that includes counseling, critical incident stress debriefing, an employee-assistance program, and support groups.[24] Safety and health training All staff members should be trained in de-escalation techniques. Training can improve knowledge about hazards and safety measures. Patient, client, and setting-related risk factors include Working directly and alone with a person having a history of violence, substance abuse, gang membership, and possession of arms. Faulty design of working place that may impede safe escape. A deficit in means of emergency communication. Transporting patients. Working in a criminal neighborhood.[24] Organizational risk factors Poor staff training and policies, understaffing, inadequate security, overcrowded patients, and unrestricted movement in hospitals are the organizational risk factors.[24] Training of health workers to reduce risk and violence The topics for training may include a policy for violence prevention and documentation, possible risk factors, warning signs, diffusing anger and methods of dealing with hostile patients, safety devices and safe rooms, a response action plan, and self and staff defense.[24] Appropriate training of supervisors to recognize dangerous situations so that they can avoid putting staff in such risky situations. SUMMARY Aggressive and assaultive behavior is a complex issue and is dealt with effectively with an appropriate management plan. Environmental modification and the safety of another person and the patient should be our priorities. Nonpharmacological methods should be the choice of initial response in case of such acute behavioral disturbance. A pharmacological approach should be used only in case of failure of other strategies. Extensive monitoring of physical health and trying to find out underlying psychopathological issues should be important aspects of care. Certain points like the definition of treatment end points, proper assessment instrument for response measurement, and issues related to consent and library of patients required further research in this area.

      "title": "Hypochondriasis between health and psychosis",
      "abstract": "Considering the lack of clarity in the conceptualisation of hypochondriasis, it is not surprising that the concept is quite heterogeneous and that there are dilemmas in terms of what is encompassed by hypochondriasis and where its boundaries are. Therefore, the aim of this review paper was to contribute towards a more coherent view on hypochondriasis, which would also allow its more adequate classification. The essential features of hypochondriasis were identified as an overvalued idea about the presence of disease, fear that the person has already become seriously ill, reassurance-seeking and other forms of health checking, and disturbances in the perception of bodily sensations and symptoms. These four aspects of hypochondriasis can be assessed dimensionally to ascertain to what extent they characterise each patient. Suggestions have been made to delineate more precisely hypochondriasis from health anxiety, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, other somatoform disorders, personality disorders, depression, and delusional disorder with disease-related delusions. In the absence of better alternatives, hypochondriasis should continue to be classified among the somatoform disorders. In order to improve communication between clinicians and reduce conceptual heterogeneity, the term 'hypochondriasis' should be used to refer only to primary hypochondriasis. The pressure to abandon this term should be resisted until an adequate substitution for it has been found.",

It is especially common in representatives of communication professions. Currently, there is no consensus on etiopathogenesis of this pathology. However, most researchers agree on inextricable connection with stress. Increased stress resistance and individual self-regulation skills are necessary to prevent emotional burnout following intense activity. Herbal teas, bee products and hirudotherapy are important components of therapy. Physical methods including physical exercise, massage and hardware physiotherapy are also important. Natural physical factors are no less effective than preformed ones.

      "title": "Post Earthquake Dizziness Syndrome",
      "abstract": "After the huge earthquake in Japan on March 11th 2011 (magnitude 9.0), many people in the eastern area of Japan close to the epicenter felt dizziness, as if they were rocking at a time when no aftershocks were actually occurring. There are a few reports about dizziness after major earthquakes in the world, but there has been no study so far with analysis of large numbers of cases of earthquake sickness. We conducted an epidemical clinical study and called those symptoms \"post earthquake dizziness syndrome; PEDS.\" Affected subjects became aware of the rocking feeling within a minute especially when indoors and seated. A significant difference was found with respect to gender, with a prevalence of females, and with the people who were prone to suffer from motion sickness. Otherwise, there was no relationship with case histories of vertigo-related diseases. On the other hand, anxiety and social stress from the disaster seemed to be contributory factors. The underlying mechanism is associated with stimuli to the vestibular and equilibrium balance systems. Emotional disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were added to the etiology. For the prevention and treatment, maintaining fitness in daily life and avoiding anxiety caused by reports in the media seemed to be important. Physiotherapy and medication also proved important to prevent symptoms from getting worse.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a major problem in medical patients. It is a problem that has been generally under-recognized and under-treated, highly associated with somatized symptoms, loss of function, and increased medical utilization. Obviously more training needs to be provided in this area for non-psychiatric physicians, as well as other primary care providers. Much of what guides recognition and treatment of depression in medical patients has been derived from studies of depression in non-medical populations. However, it is not completely clear that depression in medical populations is the same problem as that seen in the mental health care setting. Furthermore, the majority of psychopharmacology studies have been done in patients with no medical conditions. There are, fortunately, increasing numbers of drug and ECT studies in specific medical populations as well as outcome studies in medically ill depressed patients. There has been increasing recognition that in the primary care setting, less severe depressive symptom constellations are a common problem. This so-called \"sub-syndromal\" depression is an area of great interest but little understanding. There is no well researched information on such depressions in terms of natural course, response to treatment, or relation to other disorders such as anxiety disorders. It is hoped that non-psychiatric physicians will increasingly recognize depression in their patients and feel comfortable in its evaluation and initial management. Clinical practice guidelines, which may be helpful to primary care physicians, are currently being developed. When patients seem difficult to manage or diagnose, consultation should be sought from psychiatrists familiar with the special presentations and problems of working with this population.",

      "title": "Shoulder pain: to image or not to image?",
      "abstract": "1. INTRODUCTION Imaging findings should be interpreted within the broader context of an individual's shoulder symptoms (1). While imaging is valuable in identifying specific structural pathologies, findings are often equivocal. Defining what imaging changes constitute \"normal\", \"abnormal\", \"unrelated\", \"solely causative\" findings, and which are, \"contributory\", or \"associated\" with symptoms is a clinical minefield. Although a naive interpretation might equate \"normal\" with the absence of pathological features (e.g., no rotator cuff tears, calcification, or labral lesions), this is an oversimplification. For example, rotator cuff tendon tears are frequently observed in individuals without symptoms, who function for years at a very high level of performance. Rotator cuff tendon tears increase asymptomatically with increasing age, suggesting, like wrinkles and grey hair, the tears are likely to be a normal non-noxious senescent change (2). Furthermore, individuals may exhibit full mobility, exceptional muscle performance, no symptoms, and above average function despite observable labral tears, tendon irregularities commonly termed tendinosis, or partial/full-thickness rotator cuff tears (3-7). Moreover, non-sinister and non-traumatic soft tissue imaging considered to be abnormal cannot reliably distinguish currently symptomatic shoulders, previously symptomatic, or those that have never been symptomatic, as the prevalence of \"abnormal\" findings is often similar across these groups (3, 8, 9). It is arguable that many so called \"abnormalities\" have been labeled as such because they represent deviations in structure from idealized and flawless anatomical drawings. The equivocal association between imaging changes and symptoms has lead researchers and clinicians, to question a biomechanical role in symptom causation and/or perpetuation. This is evident in the arguments such as nociception is not needed to experience pain (10), and that pain should be considered a perception and not a sensation (11). These arguments, commonplace in pain science, are not supported by definitive research and should still be regarding as hypotheses and not \"fait accompli\". Without doubt, psychosocial factors and the social determinants of health play a seismic role in the experience, perpetuation, and prognosis of symptoms for those living with shoulder pain (12, 13). However, arguments have been made to reframe the relevance of 'bio' in shoulder symptoms, and recently a strong case has been made to consider bio-chemical factors in the development and perpetuation of rotator cuff related shoulder pain (14). The appropriate utilization and necessity of shoulder imaging is also equivocal. Guidelines offer inconsistent recommendations and conflicting advice concerning the prescription of radiographs for diagnosing rotator cuff tendinopathy, as some guidelines recommend radiographs during the initial evaluation (e.g., routinely), although others suggest that radiographs might be considered, especially when conservative treatment fails (15). Notably, one high-quality guideline did not recommend radiographs for the initial management (15). Lastly, International Consensus suggests using certain dynamic imaging techniques as complementary to medical history and physical examination for the clinical assessment of dysfunctional disorders (e.g., subluxation, instability). This approach could aid clinicians in perceiving \"functional\" disorders rather than solely anatomical or structural injuries (16). As a consequence of this ambiguity, a significant number of clinicians were responsible for referrals for \"low-value\" imaging, especially for those without a traumatic onset (17). To promote consideration for the role of \"bio\" in shoulder symptoms and encourage debate among clinicians and researchers, this opinion paper aims to stimulate discussion on the value of imaging in management of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. We sought to capture diverse perspectives from various health disciplines by incorporating input from clinicians, researchers, educators, physiotherapists, physicians, and nurses working within the musculoskeletal field, aimed at providing a comprehensive perspective to our manuscript. 2. PROS AND CONS OF IMAGING USE IN SHOULDER PAIN MANAGEMENT Although the judicious requests of imaging may improve clinician understanding of a specific clinical scenario, between 20–50% of imaging requests are inappropriate or of \"low-value\" (e.g., a service offering no or minimal benefit to patients). Primum non nocere (first, do no harm) is a core principal in healthcare practice. Unnecessary imaging has the potential to cause harm (e.g. unnecessary risk due to exposure to ionizing radiation) (18), prolong waiting times, and further negatively impact of spiraling healthcare costs (17). Conversely, strategies aimed at reducing low-value imaging have the potential to decrease costs by as much as 95% without compromising patient well-being (17). How patients interpret the imaging report findings will influence their beliefs about appropriate management, (e.g. \"I have a tear, I need surgery\") (19). When writing an imaging report, pathoanatomical labelling without reference to the incidence and prevalence of findings in people without symptoms could lead to \"medical overuse\" as unnecessary injections, surgical and nonsurgical procedures (20), as well as healthcare-seeking behavior reinforcing maladaptive beliefs about damage (21). A further concern in the interpretation of shoulder imaging is the observed fair to moderate inter-rater agreement among different examiners when reporting on identical scans (9, 22), a factor that is also influenced by the experience of the individual professional and which can potentially result in patient disorientation, unhelpful guidance, and unwarranted subsequent investigations (23). Studies investigating this issue, question the clinical utility of routine imaging for treatment planning, given the high prevalence of anatomical variations in asymptomatic shoulders (1, 8, 9, 24). Indeed, while imaging may identify tissue pathology, it often cannot reliably determine the clinical significance of these findings or their correlation with specific symptoms. For instance, routine plain radiographs in individuals with atraumatic shoulder pain altered the diagnosis based on medical history and physical examination in fewer than 15% of cases, and clinical management was modified in only 1.7% of cases (25). Furthermore, in individuals with frozen shoulder, additional pathologies were identified via magnetic resonance imaging in 22% of subjects. However, a modification in the treatment plan based on these findings was observed in only 2.7% of cases, and 37 resonance scans were required to identify one patient with frozen shoulder necessitating surgery due to the additional imaging findings (26). In conclusion, acceptance of imaging findings (i) without defining what abnormal is based upon and (ii) without stating the prevalence of such findings in people without symptoms, may lead to over medicalization and detrimentally impact on healthcare sustainability. Getting the balance right The thoughtful application of imaging strategies may confer several advantages. Firstly, imaging may identify relevant structural pathologies when serious pathology is a primary concern (27). In complex, traumatic, or suspicious cases, where differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms, the selection of the appropriate imaging modality may help prevent delays in management (28). Moreover, imaging may corroborate structural healing following surgical intervention. For instance, in rotator cuff repair, an ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging can confirm the secure placement of bone anchors, demonstrating the technical success of the surgery. Although importantly, from a clinical standpoint, tendon to tendon, and tendon to bone healing is not a prerequisite for a reduction in pain and improvement in function after repair (29, 30). When indicated based on a suspicion of clinically significant structural failure, imaging will be invaluable for a detailed assessment of tissue biology (e.g., a bony Bankart lesion following trauma-related anterior shoulder instability). This information will guide targeted and shared treatment decisions and facilitate specialist involvement (e.g., surgical consultation) as necessary, promoting a positive multidisciplinary approach involving specialists capable of accurate, evidence-based interpretation of structural details. Lastly, in cases where non-surgical management does not result in the expected clinical improvement, the contribution of traumatically and non-traumatically acquired structural variations warrants evaluation, facilitated by the wise selection of imaging for changing the path of care (27). In Table 1, we presented scenarios taken from everyday clinical practice to stimulate discussion on pro-and cons-for imaging use in shoulder pain management, while Figure 1 (Supplementary material), details a SWOT -strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat-analysis for the use of imaging in shoulder pain management. Lastly, we have included a clinical decision-making diagram (Figure 2, Supplementary Material) to illustrate the authors' proposed method for integrating clinical and imaging findings. This diagram is designed to simplify the decision-making process for determining when imaging is necessary, unnecessary, or a borderline case. 3. IMPLICATIONS Prior to, or during attendance at out-patient shoulder orthopedic clinics routine imaging (usually radiographs) is common practice. This may help identify rare conditions requiring urgent management, such as osteosarcomas. However, in-depth interview practice and appropriate safety netting would reduce the need for blanket imaging and lessen the potential harms associated with being informed of tendon and/or bone changes that may, and equally may not be associated with symptoms and in the main will respond equally well to non-surgical management. \"Low-value\" imaging equates to billions of dollars of wasted resources. For example, within magnetic resonance imaging, a primary cohort receiving imaging referrals discordant with guidelines included orthopedic patients and patients referred by general practitioners (17, 31). Additionally, atraumatic pain was identified as a specific clinical condition where the use of \"low-value\" imaging was particularly evident (17). Measures for reducing \"low-value\" imaging and to promote reasonable use and recommendation of it are needed at all levels of healthcare, for promoting interprofessional collaboration and networking, thereby improving patient care and perceived support by the patient. Clinical guidelines recommend judicious use of imaging in people with shoulder pain, discouraging routine imaging, but fully utilize their use in probable red flag presentations (27, 32). Imaging should also be considered in non-improving (possibly at 12 weeks), or earlier, with worsening symptoms (27, 32). The appropriate utilization of imaging for a comprehensive understanding of clinical scenarios holds significant implications for both clinical practice and research. Clinicians (e.g., physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists) bear the responsibility to justify the need to image and if a decision to image is made, determine the appropriate timing and type of imaging studies. This must be done within a shared decision making framework, and to recognize when multidisciplinary consultation is necessary to address patient needs effectively (33). Shared decision making requires consideration of the benefits and potential harms of imaging. It needs to be framed within comprehensive patient education, encompassing the current clinical status and patient wishes for management. For example, in the absence of red flag concerns is imaging necessary for a patient who wishes to focus on non-invasive, non-surgical management (34)? This opinion paper aims to stimulate a mature, balanced discourse that empowers less experienced clinicians to make informed decisions with individual patients, considering all pertinent factors contributing to their well-being. Within a proper application of the bio-psycho-social model of care, biological variables must be acknowledged, and in-depth analysis through imaging modalities can serve as a valuable strategy. As showed in the six clinical cases in Table 1, people presenting with painful shoulder conditions, particularly when specific anamnesis and predisposing factors were present, imaging may: • Confirm the presence of structural abnormalities requiring multidisciplinary consultation (e.g., expert opinion(s)). • Guide clinicians towards targeted interventions addressing specific structural pathologies, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy (e.g., calcific tendinopathy). • Prevent adverse outcomes resulting from misdiagnosed conditions (e.g., instability with rotator cuff tear). • Facilitate accurate differential diagnosis, mitigating the risk of overlooking clinically significant comorbidities (e.g. frozen shoulder). 4. CONCLUSION Clinical practice frequently lacks balance and frequently is conducted at the ends of a spectrum. With one end being rigid reliance on structural imaging and the other its rejection in favor of a psychosocial narrative. Yet clinical reality is rarely binary, and practicing at the end of any spectrum, as is in most situations in life, leads to cognitive distortion, and blind adherence to one belief over another. Recent medical examples include the discourse on vaccination, and in physiotherapy, the -often-toxic debate relating to touch therapy. The Latin phrase, in medias res (the solution lies in the middle) is very apt. To promote a judicious, resourceful, and evidence-based utilization of imaging, research should emphasize a comprehensive bio-psycho-social care pathway. Within this framework, all relevant domains should be engaged and weighted according to the specific clinical context. Educational curricula for all health professions should incorporate formative modules designed to enhance expertise in imaging strategies, including their clinical applicability and utility, strengths and limitations, and potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, receiving individualized written audit and feedback on imaging request rates —including the benefits of addressing imaging overuse, links to educational resources, and guidance on limiting imaging requests— could significantly decreased overall rate of musculoskeletal imaging requests (35-37), and could be a widely strategy for enhancing professional practice. A balanced, context-driven use of imaging, grounded in clinical reasoning and embedded in a biopsychosocial model, can enhance diagnosis, inform treatment, and support shared decision-making. Imaging is a valuable tool when used wisely: the question is not whether to use it, but when, why, and for whom. Table 1. Clinical practice scenarios to stimulate discussion on pro-and cons-for imaging use in shoulder pain management CLINICAL SCENARIO CASE DISCUSSION Suspected red flag conditions A 56-year-old housewife woman presented via direct access with atraumatic right shoulder pain. The patient reported concurrent right thoracic pain (in the region of the 7th rib) and exacerbation of shoulder pain with vigorous housework. She also reported a spontaneous cough of two weeks' duration. Notably, her night pain lessened when lying on her right side. No deficits in strength or sensation were reported, and the clinical shoulder examination was unremarkable Key Clinical Features: The initial screening allows physiotherapists to guide their decision to either treat, treat and refer for further imaging or consultation, or directly refer the patient for external medical evaluation if the issue are suspected to fails outside the scope of physiotherapy (33, 38). The patient presents with shoulder pain, a concurrent cough, and pain that worsens with exertion but is not reproducible during a physical shoulder examination. The pain is relieved by lying on the affected side. Decision Point & Rationale: The combination of symptoms—especially the presence of a cough and pain that doesn't originate from the shoulder joint itself—raises red flags for a non-musculoskeletal cause (39). These signs suggest a potential underlying pulmonary issue, such as pneumonia, pleuritis, or a Pancoast tumor. This suspicion prompts an immediate referral for medical consultation. In fact, shoulder pain can often be referred from various thoracic and visceral pathologies, mimicking a direct shoulder issue (28, 38, 40, 41). Imaging & Management Impact: An X-ray is the appropriate initial imaging modality to rule out lung involvement. This timely imaging and referral are crucial for ensuring the patient receives a prompt and accurate diagnosis, leading to appropriate medical treatment rather than ineffective physiotherapy. Post-traumatic painful shoulder A 48-year-old male lawyer presented to a private physiotherapy practice with left shoulder pain. He reported a fall from a height of one meter one week prior. He did not seek emergency department care initially as the pain was not severe; however, the pain has since intensified and is now present at night. Shoulder Key Clinical Features: The patient has a history of trauma, and over the course of a week, their shoulder pain and loss of function have progressively worsened, with notable nocturnal pain. A significant risk factor is their 20-year history of corticosteroid use, which increases fracture risk. The patient also presents with limited external rotation and abduction, which could indicate a posterior shoulder dislocation. Decision Point & Rationale: The combination of trauma, progressive pain (especially nocturnal), and the risk factor of long-term steroid use raises a strong suspicion for a fracture (such as an impacted greater tuberosity fracture) or a posterior shoulder dislocation, which movements, particularly abduction, were reported as painful. The patient has a history of smoking since the age of 20 years and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed at age 28, managed with corticosteroids during symptom flare-ups can be easily missed (73.2% of cases). Given that these injuries require specific management and can worsen with a delay in diagnosis, immediate imaging is warranted over conservative care. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging is crucial for a definitive diagnosis, and is mandatory when the bone profiles of the clavicle or acromion raise concerns about bone integrity. It is also necessary when the patient experiences severe pain that doesn't decrease even after pharmacological therapy, or when a large hematoma (Hennequin sign) is evident in the anterolateral part of the shoulder and arm. Notably, some fractures like an impacted greater tuberosity fracture, might not cause intense immediate pain and could be not easily recognizable. In this particular scenario, imaging helps to either confirm a fracture or identify a posterior shoulder dislocation, when clinical examination is not enough. In fact, while observable signs like a posterior protuberance, a flattening of the anterior shoulder profile, and coracoid prominence (42) along with anterior and posterior shoulder pain and limited external rotation and abduction (possibly due to an associated McLaughlin lesion (43)) can raise suspicion; these signs might be absent in more corpulent patients. In this case, true antero-posterior and Y-view X-ray projections are mandatory for assessing humeral head position relative to the glenoid (44) and identify this pathology, as it often requires a different course of treatment (e.g., immobilization or surgery) to restore function. Rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy A 54-year-old office worker female presented to a private physiotherapy practice reporting a sudden onset of intense and intolerable pain (Numeric Rating Scale for Pain 8/10) in her shoulder, experienced since the previous day, and an inability to abduct her arm. The patient reported significant nocturnal pain disruption. Her medical history included diabetes and hypothyroidism, but no history of trauma\". Key Clinical Features: Given the clinical features collected during the medical history reporting - middle-aged woman with a history of metabolic/endocrine comorbidities, presenting with sudden, severe nocturnal shoulder pain and restricted active motion-rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy should be considered (45). Decision Point & Rationale: The presence of calcific deposits doesn't always correlate with symptoms, as only about half of individuals with calcifications report shoulder pain (46), and the resorption phase of calcification is often linked to increased symptom severity. Clinical examination alone may not reveal the calcification phase (47-49). however, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide a treatment plan (50). Imaging & Management Impact: Ultrasound with Power Doppler is the imaging modality of choice. It can confirm the presence of calcification, determine its size and location, and help assess if it is in an active, painful phase. Moreover, a combination of ultrasound and power Doppler can help determine if calcification is the source of pain, significantly influencing management (46). This information is critical for management, as it allows for specific interventions like extracorporeal shockwave therapy or percutaneous lavage, which are highly effective for this condition. The resulting treatment plan can be precisely tailored to the individual, potentially providing faster relief and better long-term outcomes than general conservative care (48, 51-53). Moreover, since calcific deposits can occur in various anatomical locations, they could necessitate diverse conservative or interventional approaches depending on the specific pattern of calcific tendinopathy (54). Consequently, a rehabilitation program tailored to the individual, integrating both clinical and sonographic findings, is vital for optimizing care and enhancing the patient's quality of life (53). It's worth noting that the relationship between calcification resorption and improved clinical outcomes (pain, function, or treatment success) remains debated and it is still a controversial topic. (52). Antero-inferior glenohumeral dislocation A 57-year-old male automotive mechanic presented to a private physiotherapy practice following 20 days of immobilization for a traumatic anteroinferior glenohumeral dislocation. Emergency department physicians confirmed reduction via radiography and recommended physiotherapy after three weeks of brace immobilization. The patient's medical history included a 15-year history of diabetes and a 10-year history of smoking (10 cigarettes/day); in family history, a rotator cuff repair was reported for the patient's mother and brother Key Clinical Features: In patients over 40 who have experienced a traumatic shoulder dislocation, a rotator cuff tear is a plausible concern that requires careful investigation. Post-immobilization pain and stiffness can be significant challenges, as they may mask identifiable strength deficits, potentially leading to a missed diagnosis. Key predisposing factors, such as smoking history (quantity and time) (55), diabetes (56), and genetics (57, 58) should also raise suspicion and warrant further assessment. Decision Point & Rationale: The main decision point is whether to consider imaging when clinical limitations (like pain or stiffness) prevent a reliable strength test or when predisposing risk factors are present. A delayed diagnosis can compromise rehabilitation outcomes and lead to larger rotator cuff tears. Therefore, evidence-based physiotherapy practice necessitates a proactive approach to screening in these specific patient populations. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging should be considered whenever a rotator cuff tear is suspected, particularly when clinical assessments are unreliable. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical situation, obtained through imaging, is crucial for preventing a missed or delayed diagnosis. Identifying a tear early allows for a more effective and tailored management plan, which can prevent the tear from worsening and significantly improve rehabilitation outcomes. Frozen shoulder A 58-year-old female architect presented with a 4-month history of daily and nocturnal shoulder pain, unresponsive to pharmacotherapy. The patient reported severe sleep disruption and an inability to Key Clinical Features: It's crucial to consider the differential diagnosis of frozen shoulder, as several pathologies can mimic it. Conditions like neoplasms of the proximal humeral head, glenohumeral arthritis, and avascular necrosis can present with similar symptoms and can't be reliably differentiated through a medical history or physical exam alone (59). A patient's predisposing factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, a history of malignancy, or abduct or rotate her arm. Passive range of motion was also limited, with an empty end-feel due to intractable pain. Her medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, a rheumatological pathology (i.e. lupus erythematosus), and a history of uterine carcinoma three years prior. lupus erythematosus, can be risk factors for both frozen shoulder and these other serious conditions. In this particular case, diabetes and dyslipidemia were recognized predisposing factors for frozen shoulder development (60-62), but diabetes and lupus erythematosus are also risk factors for avascular necrosis (63-65). Moreover, the patient's history of malignancy warrants careful consideration (66). Decision Point & Rationale: The main decision point revolves around when to order imaging. While some experts don't support routine imaging for every patient, arguing it's unnecessary without a history suggestive of a serious disease, others believe it's essential, especially when predisposing risk factors are present (67). The rationale is to either confirm a diagnosis of frozen shoulder or to identify a potentially life-threatening or debilitating condition that requires different, and often more urgent, management. Therapists should remain vigilant and re-evaluate the diagnosis if a patient doesn't improve with treatment or if their symptoms worsen [67]. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging is a critical tool in these scenarios. If a neoplasm is identified, it could be life-saving. If avascular necrosis is diagnosed, prompt and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. A recent international consensus suggests that if a patient with a presumed frozen shoulder doesn't respond to initial therapy and an intra-articular injection, imaging should then be performed to rule out other pathologies (68). Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain A 53-year-old male middle school educator presented at a private physiotherapy clinic with a two-week history of anterolateral shoulder pain on the dominant side, representing the first such episode in his lifetime. The patient reported no history of trauma. The individual does not smoke or participate in regular exercise. He has a high body mass index Recent medical history included a relocation to a new residence three weeks prior to presentation. This involved considerable lifting and carrying. Key Clinical Features: The patient presents with shoulder pain but without a history of trauma or intense sporting activity. Key findings include a high body mass index, a history of overuse, minimal restriction in passive range of motion, a painful arc, and reported weakness with abduction. Such factors increase the suspicion of rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (69, 70). Decision Point & Rationale: Given the patient's history and symptoms, imaging is not immediately necessary. Instead, the focus should be on a trial of conservative care. Contrariwise, early referral for imaging here, could be disadvantageous. Imaging findings have demonstrated a weak association with symptom perception and are unlikely to alter the treatment trajectory. Moreover, a lay interpretation of imaging reports by non-experts —without adequate education regarding the prevalence and incidence of tendon structural abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals (6, 9)— could be detrimental to engagement in rehabilitation and adherence to therapeutic exercise. Additionally, this could foster expectations for more invasive treatments (19, 21), increase \"medical overuse\" and Clinical examination revealed a painful arc of motion during shoulder abduction; however, a full range of motion was otherwise preserved. Furthermore, strength assessment of external and internal rotation demonstrated comparable mean values bilaterally, while isometric resisted elevation at 90° of arm flexion exhibited diminished strength on the affected side. reinforce maladaptive beliefs (20, 21). Finally, imaging has not consistently shown prognostic value (12, 13). Imaging & Management Impact: A well-structured rehabilitation program is the primary management strategy. This includes patient education on their condition, therapeutic exercises, and lifestyle modifications (e.g., improving sleep, diet, and physical activity) (71-73), delivered through patient-centered communication and incorporating behavioral change strategies into the educational component (74). Exercise is frequently effective, expected, and generally well-received by individuals with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (75, 76), and lifestyle modifications represent a promising group of interventions for enhancing clinical outcomes in shoulder tendinopathy, (20, 72, 73, 77). Imaging should be reserved for cases where the patient's symptoms don't improve with conservative care or if there's an unexpected worsening of symptoms within a reasonable timeframe (27, 32). This approach avoids \"medical overuse,\" reduces maladaptive beliefs about the condition, and promotes patient engagement in a proven, effective treatment plan.",

Ascribed and prescribed, mental illness diagnoses and experiences vary based on medicalized norms. Medicalization of mental illness occurs via three main authoritative professions: psychiatry, psychology, and clinical social work. The institution of medicine holds absolute authority over what is considered “natural” and “normal” in mental health and creates stigma. Disclosure has historically been discussed as a remedy but is limited according to social identities as well as determinants of health. Disclosure of mental illness as a disability can be problematic in workplaces. Experiences of sanism, or discrimination based on perceived level of sanity, are common.

In this article, we review the influence of stress-related factors in OCD. Overall, studies indicate that: patients with OCD frequently report stressful and traumatic life events before illness onset, although these rates do not seem to be significantly different from those described in other disorders; the association between OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) might result from symptom overlap, although cases of patients developing OCD after PTSD and showing obsessive–compulsive symptoms that were unrelated to trauma have been described fairly consistently; it is unclear whether patients with OCD and a history of stress-related factors (including stressful life events, traumatic life events or comorbid PTSD) may respond better or worse to the available treatments; and comorbid PTSD may modify the clinical expression of OCD – although controlled studies comparing pre- versus post-traumatic OCD patients are still unavailable. In conclusion, there is a growing evidence to suggest a role for stress-related factors in OCD. Although the available literature does not confirm the existence of a post-traumatic subtype of OCD, it does call for further systematic research into this topic.",

On the contrary, in the latter case, it does not offer elements for any etiopathogenic hypothesis because it happens in almost all cases with an acute onset in an otherwise healthy subject and it is always underestimated because of the minor functional impairment. However, clinical studies in the last years led to a significant evolution of otological findings as an early important symptom in the etiopathogenic study and in the diagnosis of some internal diseases.

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem.

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ARID1B-related disorder (ARID1B-RD) constitutes a clinical continuum, from classic Coffin-Siris syndrome to intellectual disability with or without nonspecific dysmorphic features. Coffin-Siris syndrome is classically characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the distal phalanx or nail of the fifth and additional digits, developmental or cognitive delay of varying degree, distinctive facial features, hypotonia, hypertrichosis, and sparse scalp hair. Frequencies of other features, such as developmental delay (with speech often more affected than motor development), is consistent across the clinical spectrum, and may include malformations of the cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and/or central nervous systems. Other findings seen in individuals with ARID1B-RD include feeding difficulties, slow growth, ophthalmologic abnormalities, hearing impairment, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autistic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ARID1B-RD is established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ARID1B by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for strabismus, refractive error, hearing loss, congenital heart defects, obstructive sleep apnea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, cryptorchidism, scoliosis, and seizure disorders. For significant feeding issues, a nasogastric and/or gastrostomy tube may be required. Developmental therapies, including speech/language and feeding therapy, is recommended for those with developmental delay. Surveillance: At least annual assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; annual ophthalmology evaluation and assessment for scoliosis (until growth is complete). Audiology evaluation, behavior assessment, and hormonal evaluation/bone age as needed based on symptoms. Those with seizures should be monitored as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling ARID1B-related disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. With the exception of two families in which a parent and child had features consistent with ARID1B-related disorder, all individuals diagnosed to date have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Once the ARID1B pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "THE ROLE OF THE PITUITARY GLAND IN EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "The problem of epilepsy may be best approached by considering all convulsions which are accompanied by unconsciousness, whether periodic or otherwise, as symptoms of some underlying pathologic state or disease.By doing this the convulsion becomes a symptom.The question then arises, which I believe should be answered in the negative, whether any so-called epileptic state should, of itself, be con- sidered a disease. ETIOLOGIC FACTORSThus, among the underlying causes of convulsions are uremia, eclampsia and other toxicoses; several varieties of trauma, as birth trauma and that from blows on the head; certain intracranial irrita- tions, as brain tumors and cerebral hemorrhages; certain infections, as syphilis and varieties of meningitis; certain conditions of cerebral maldevelopment accompanied by a degree of brain cell deterioration; and certain conditions of the pituitary gland causing a change in its secretion.I believe, therefore, that convulsions, whether periodical and termed epilepsy, or not, are due to definite pathologic cerebral tissue changes which may be congenital or induced, and hence, that epilepsy is an organic and not a functional condition.In the toxic and pituitary cases there may exist previous malformation and instability of the cortical cells, or, on the other hand, it is perfectly conceivable that the toxic substance or the changed pituitary secretion may produce their own cortical cell deterioration.I published a paper on the relation of the pituitary gland to some cases of epilepsy, and in 19141 and again in 1916,2 a paper on the subject of hypopituitarism in its relation to epilepsy.These papers were the result of a personal suggestion of Dr. Harvey Cushing and also of the perusal of his most excellent book.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders",
      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation.

Observational studies have consistently demonstrated associations with occupational activities such as heavy lifting and forceful repetitive movements of the wrist and hand, which physically stress relevant anatomical structures.1 Thus, although there is often no demonstrable underlying injury to tissues that would account for reported symptoms,2 preventive efforts in the workplace have focused mainly on ergonomic measures designed to reduce mechanical loading. Disappointingly, randomised controlled trials of ergonomic interventions have failed to demonstrate major benefits in the prevention either of low back3 or upper limb pain,4 although evidence on the latter is rather sparse. Moreover, research has revealed large international variation in the prevalence of disability from musculoskeletal pain, even among workers with similar jobs,5 and also major temporal changes within countries that cannot be explained by biomechanical factors.6 These observations indicate that there must also be other important causes.\n\nAnother notable epidemiological feature of musculoskeletal pain is its tendency to recur, and to affect multiple anatomical …",

It is known that hormonal changes can lead to significant emotional changes and vice versa, due to changes in the central nervous system, action of hormones on specific receptors or by metabolic changes, therefore, the endocrine disorders become one of the possible causes of depression. This work is a study of the major hormones associated with depression. It was drawn from a literature review, in which corticotrophin hormone, cortisol, estrogen, progesterone and thyroid hormones were identified as the main hormones related to depression. These hormones are essential for the correct functioning of the metabolism, therefore, it is observed that hormonal changes may contribute to the development of depression as well as aggravate it or even hamper the treatment of patients who already have the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

      "title": "The Problem of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Functional&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;",
      "abstract": "Functional neurological disorder is an entity that is commonly referred to by names such as psychogenic or conversion disorder [1]. It is defined as a neurological disorder caused by psychological factors, falling into the category of somatic symptom disorders in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Some well-known examples of somatic symptom disorders involving other organ systems include irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and chronic pelvic pain [2].\r\n\r\nPatients with functional disorders are seen in various clinical settings and are commonly admitted as an inpatient for further work-up and symptom management [3]. Those with neurological symptoms in particular may receive work-up beyond the scope of being thorough, as their symptoms can be concerning for neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. Physicians may ultimately become convinced that these patients’ symptoms are due to a psychological cause, but convincing these patients may not be easy, as the suffering is real but the treatment is not instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAs a movement disorders clinical fellow, I often see patients with functional movement disorders. Functional movement disorders can present in various ways such as tremor, myoclonus, or dystonia, but share common clinical features on examination such as variability, distractibility and entrainibility of the movements [4]. Although the term psychogenic is considered to be less ambiguous than functional, its negative nuance may add to the patients’ struggle to accept the diagnosis. Some common reactions are: “Are you saying it is all in my head?” “I find it hard to believe that what I am experiencing is just from stress.” “…but I don’t feel stressed.”\r\n\r\nThrough my fellowship, I have tried different ways of delivering the diagnosis of a functional movement disorder. My strategy has evolved with experience, a mix of successful and unsuccessful situations. For example, the patient might seem to be initially receptive of the diagnosis and considering the recommended treatment options with a positive attitude. When this appeared to be the case, I would feel not only relieved, but also a sense of triumph-I had successfully dealt with a challenging situation, and now surely the patient would be on the road to recovery! I quickly realized that this was not always the case. In the following days, I would receive emails doubting or misinterpreting the diagnosis that seemed to be clear at the time. Some patients seemed unhappy, if not angry or disappointed. I would often review the approach that I had used to deliver the diagnosis on the day of the visit, and try to revise my strategy accordingly, hoping to be more successful the next time.\r\n\r\nSeveral reasons may underlie this difficulty of accepting the diagnosis of a functional disorder. Currently, the knowledge on the physiology of the disorder is limited, and we cannot satisfactorily explain to these patients exactly how this occurs, which may add to the patient’s skepticism towards the diagnosis. The variability of symptoms, a common feature of the disorder itself, may confuse and deceive the patients, leaving them to wonder what rare organic neurological disorder they might have as the cause. Last but not least, patients may be influenced by the stigma of having any disorder that has relation to psychological factors, and even misinterpret the diagnosis as malingering, an intentional production of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBut do we physicians also have difficulty embracing the diagnosis of a functional disorder? Some patients are seen by several physicians and undergo extensive testing until seen by someone who might finally share the diagnosis. It is not unusual that this can be years later since the beginning of symptoms. Delivering the diagnosis is certainly challenging for reasons mentioned above, and physicians fear missing an organic neurological disorder. However, simply labeling these patients as having ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ not only leads to increased healthcare cost [5], but can result in increased morbidity and mortality from unnecessary diagnostic workup or treatment.\r\n\r\n“How can you tell me it’s functional when I am not functional?” The words of a patient echo through my head as I share this diagnosis with yet another patient. I only hope to be able to help my patients so that they understand that the diagnosis was achieved through identifying positive signs and symptoms, and that it is not merely a diagnosis of exclusion. I try to reassure them that this disorder is very much real, involuntary and acknowledge that it can be very disabling. Some patients have accepted the diagnosis and made a substantial recovery through cognitive behavioral therapy. Hopefully, with more knowledge on the physiology, increased awareness of the disorder in both patients and the medical community and better strategies of sharing the diagnosis functional can one day become truly functional.",

      "abstract": "Digital syndactyly is a common congenital anomaly and is associated with other anomalies affecting the digits, the hand, the arm or even the entire body. In the past it has been considered a single entity. However, recent information provided by experimental embryology, studies of morphogenesis and other sources, suggests that there are at least two distinct entities: primary syndactyly due to interference with the sequence of events that normally culminate in the division of digits into discrete parts and secondary syndactyly due to readhesion of adjacent digits as a result of close contact between raw surfaces. Primary syndactylyl may arise de novo, or it may occur as a manifestation of a mutation phenomenon or as a genetically controlled syndrome. Secondary syndactyly is the result of mechanical adhesion of adjacent parts involved in a general reparative or healing process. The initial insult leading to amputation of a portion of the digits may or may not be genetically controlled; adhesion is fortuitous. Management of syndactyly is determined by the complexity of the malformation. For simple cutaneous syndactyly the surgeon should make a zigzag incision and provide a rectangular, proximally based flap for the floor of the web, usually before the child is 2 years of age. A full- or split-thickness skin graft should be applied to the defects. For complex deformities involving several digits and associated with postural or osseous malformation, several operative procedures may be required. The surgeon must be vigilant to note and correct the sequelae resulting from recurrent contractures and imbalances associated with growth.",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome consists in the association of an aphasia acquired during childhood or adolescence after a period of normal development, accompanied by epileptic fits and, sometimes, psychological disturbances. The appearance of the symptoms may not be simultaneous. The nature of this syndrome has been widely discussed and even the possibility of being a non-unitary syndrome has been considered. It may be possibly due to diverse etiologies, genetic or acquired (infectious). The relation between the aphasic, the psychologic and the convulsive symptoms has also raised controversies. A case of a female is described in which the psychological symptomatology was so severe, she had to be admitted in a psychiatric unit. The symptoms consisted in agitation during the night and severe persistent insomnia so as difficulties for relationship during day. No abnormalities were detected in a TAC nor in a RM but electroencephalographic and neuropsychological abnormalities were detected. The epileptic fits disappeared with a carbamacepine treatment but the rest of symptoms remained even more accentuated. After her admission, a treatment with valproate achieved to control her fits and the aphasic symptoms and neuropsychological deficits were compensated in the course of several months. After a year of treatment the patient's life was normalized, she resumed her studies, the EEG abnormalities disappeared so as the psychological disturbances and the behavior problems with the exception of phobic symptoms, similar to the ones of other family members. The patient has a history of epilepsy on its mother's side. The evolution and treatment response suggests that at least in some cases of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, the etiology of the aphasia and other neuropsychological deficits and of the behavior disorders are related with some subclinical epileptic discharges and with a \"functional inhibition\" of some areas of the nervous system.",

Back pain is sorted into three categories, differentiated by the duration of symptoms. Acute back pain, which is the focus of this article, is classified as pain lasting 6 weeks or less, subacute back pain is pain that has been present between 6 and 12 weeks, and chronic back pain is pain that persists longer than 12 weeks. Etiologies of low back pain include (but are certainly not limited to) mechanical injury (e.g., muscle sprain or spasm, ligament strain, facet joint disruption), arthritis, sciatica (lumbar radiculopathy), spinal fracture, malignancy, connective tissue disease, infection (e.g., vertebral osteomyelitis, epidural abscess), cauda equina syndrome, metabolic causes (e.g., hyperparathyroidism), abdominal or retroperitoneal visceral or vascular processes, psychogenic pain, and malingering. Careful history-taking and physical examination are crucial to diagnosing the etiology of back pain. This review presents the current state of science regarding the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have heightened sensitivity and increased symptoms following various physiologic challenges, such as orthostatic stress, physical exercise, and cognitive challenges. Similar heightened sensitivity to the same stressors in fibromyalgia (FM) has led investigators to propose that these findings reflect a state of central sensitivity. A large body of evidence supports the concept of central sensitivity in FM. A more modest literature provides partial support for this model in CFS, particularly with regard to pain. Nonetheless, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction have not been explained by the central sensitivity data thus far. Peripheral factors have attracted attention recently as contributors to central sensitivity. Work by Brieg, Sunderland, and others has emphasized the ability of the nervous system to undergo accommodative changes in length in response to the range of limb and trunk movements carried out during daily activity. If that ability to elongate is impaired—due to movement restrictions in tissues adjacent to nerves, or due to swelling or adhesions within the nerve itself—the result is an increase in mechanical tension within the nerve. This adverse neural tension, also termed neurodynamic dysfunction, is thought to contribute to pain and other symptoms through a variety of mechanisms. These include mechanical sensitization and altered nociceptive signaling, altered proprioception, adverse patterns of muscle recruitment and force of muscle contraction, reduced intra-neural blood flow, and release of inflammatory neuropeptides. Because it is not possible to differentiate completely between adverse neural tension and strain in muscles, fascia, and other soft tissues, we use the more general term \"neuromuscular strain.\" In our clinical work, we have found that neuromuscular restrictions are common in CFS, and that many symptoms of CFS can be reproduced by selectively adding neuromuscular strain during the examin",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

This finding, however, was most pronounced in retired patients, subjects living alone, and persons found unconscious outside buildings or in public places. One important trigger of cardiac arrest is going to work after weekends; however, resumption of social and other activities on Mondays is another possible trigger. Other factors, such as endogenous biological rhythms, may contribute to an increased risk at this particular time even in elderly.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYModern life imposes several different labor demands on humanbeings; thus, bringing about stressing situations. All those eventsperceived as threatening bringing about tension are called stressors.A stressing situation comes about when there exists a discrepancybetween environment demands and adequate resources to cope withthem. All these factors lead to physiological, cognitive and motorresponses which enhance perception and create the need of bettersolutions to allow appropriate adaptation behaviors.When stress is present at the workplace in a recurrent fashion, itis known as Labor Stress (LS), an alarming circumstance affectingindividuals and organizations. Main causes of LS are: physicalconditions, schedule, work position, interpersonal relations and otherorganizational variables.Labor Stress is a public health and a labor health problem, for itis related to an increase in labor accident, morbidity and absenteeismrates; thus, generating negative attitudes that yield economic loss toinstitutions.The Burnout Syndrome (BS) is a response to chronically laborstress manifested through emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,as well as hostile and aggressive attitudes toward workmates andservice users, resulting in a feeling of poor personal development.ObjectiveAssess the effect of a psycho-educative intervention to decrease BS inmanaging or directive employees from one sector of CFEGuadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.Materials and methodologyA quasi-experimental study was carried out; this included measure-ments prior and after educative intervention carried out on confidenceemployees from CFE Guadalajara from Februa ry through September2005.The study sample was made up of 29 managing or directiveemployees, conforming four groups; one random-selected groupreceived educative intervention; the other three were control groups;different questionnaires were applied: personal data, psycho-socialfactors and BS through the Maslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI).From a participativ e-educational view point, encouraged by thePan-American Health Organization (PHO), the educative interventionsought health promotion through the betterment and consistency ofmental and physical wellbeing.All BS concepts as well as psychological factors were analyzed.Other workshop included the development of preventing, coping andtreatment strategies at individual and social levels. F inally, a correctiveprogram directed to decreasing psychological risk factors in theorganization was encouraged. Also, a post-intervention assessmentwas applied.ResultsSubjects had an average age of 31.5 ± 6.8 years; 52% were females;group 1 decreased for all indicators; emotional exhaustion from 71%to 29%; depersonalization from 43% to 14%; lack of personaldevelopment from 57% to 14%. However, no significant differencewas found in both groups by sex.DiscussionIn personnel with specific responsibilities, obligations, opportunities,challenges and rewards based on their performance work environmentoften drives them to frustration and despair. When the employeebelieves that gives more than he receives, he becomes emotionallyexhausted and more even if he do not have the resources to cope withthe prospect of work. Also, it is documented that at younger age thereis an increased risk of presenting the Burnout.This is because interpersonal relationships are more contentiousbecause of the lack of experience in management. In the seriesreported, on both groups we were not able to document thisrelationship, but still, there is a lack of an international consensus torecognize this as a risk factor.Mingote describes that when the employee has less than fiveyears working, they are often idealistic, utopian dreamers, unlikethose with more than ten years in the job and are in risk of experiencingmonotony at work, loss of interest and the downgrade.Also, this type of workers is subject to overtime. This excessproduces physical and mental stress and leads to lower feelings ofpersonal accomplishment. Even though there could be resourcesfor coping with the monotony at work and that provides resources",

      "abstract": "The aetiology of those movement disorders characterized by localized, involuntary intermittent, and repetitive muscular spasm remains obscure. They include spasmodic torticollis, writer's and other occupational cramps, and facial spasms. The obscurity is reflected in psychiatric and neurological classification. Some, or all, are frequently regarded as conversion symptoms, although they differ profoundly from those typical of that group, particularly in terms of prognosis. Secondly, some, or all, have been regarded as variants of dystonia musculorum deformans. Otherwise, they occupy an indeterminate or ‘miscellaneous' place in classification. If it could be shown that a substantial number of clinical characteristics are shared by those who exhibit localized spasmodic conditions, they could justifiably be regarded as a distinct nosological entity. This might reasonably be regarded as a step towards clarifying their aetiology.",

      "abstract": "The concept of prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia is an old matter of debate. There have been reported several signs and symptoms that are considered to have a predictive value in a first psychotic episode, namely in the mood or anxious spectrums. However, these symptoms are not specific and can overlap with other disorders that have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. To present a young adult with marked anxious symptoms, namely in obsessive-compulsive spectrum, and psychotic (subclinical) symptoms, questioning the extension of the comorbidity between anxious disorders and schizophrenia. A case report is presented and a literature review of the theme is shortly surveyed. The case report is about a 20 years old man, who have been developing for about two years obsessive thoughts of doubt concerning his sexuality, death and his mental health. Additionally, he described sensations of depersonalization, derealization and an intense distress that have been interfering with his function and daily activity. Several studies report substantial presence of anxious symptoms (including OCD symptoms) in schizophrenia, suggesting its early appearance in the development of the disease. Moreover, they can act as predictor of poorer outcome and may promote transition from psychotic symptoms to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia prodromal stages, anxious symptoms may increase the risk and predict the development of psychosis disorder. On the other hand, the existence of mild psychotic symptoms can be present in neurotic disorders, witch compels clinicians to be cautious in the differential diagnosis that enclose these symptoms.",

In this paper we propose to review the physiopathology, clinical features and diagnostic procedures of these crises.There are three types of reflex anoxic cerebral crises: asphyxiating anoxic crises, ischemic anoxic crises and asphyxiating-ischemic anoxic crises. They are caused by sudden activation of the so-called syncopal reflex. They are characterized by diverse clinical manifestations and may often be mistaken for epileptic crises. They are related to various precipitating factors such as a blow, often to the head, an emotional stimulus or something which upsets or molests, hyperthermia, abdominal pain, headache, physical exertion, prolonged standing-up, exposure to heat, the sight of blood, feeling of fear and other factors.Important elements for the diagnosis of these crises are the presence of a family history of vagal crises, the presence of precipitating factors, brief duration of the crises (seconds) in most patients, and clinical signs of facial or perioral pallor or cyanosis. The test involving pressure on the eyeball and the tilting table are useful for diagnosis. However, they should be used sensibly.",

Such similarity could be defined on purely clinical grounds or at the level of disease mechanism and aetiology. It is this tension of distinctiveness and similarity that makes the scientific study of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders challenging. The concept of the schizophrenia spectrum can be traced back to Bleuler and his book Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias. 1 The schizophrenias are characterised by significant heterogeneity of signs and symptoms, disease course and outcome. This gives rise to various clinical subtypes and to variants defined by a shorter duration of illness. Most importantly, the outcome of the schizophrenias ranges from long-term disability to",

      "abstract": "Lives can be severely disrupted after a momentous negative experience. Particularly potent are unexpected negative events, or “traumas,” such as a near death experience, a severe injury, or being exposed to intense interpersonal violence or a natural disaster. Although most people recover from these traumatic events, many do not, and experience persistent fear, anxiety and/or depression following the event. In the past, these maladaptations after trauma were considered to be a reflection of personal weaknesses and were stigmatized. Now, after 30 years of research, the physiological responses to severe stress and trauma are being increasingly understood, as are the risk factors for a pathological response to trauma. These gains from the study of memory and neurohormonal reactivity and control systems hold forth the promise of improved, biologically-informed, psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the future.",

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker.

Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

      "title": "Effect of optimism/pessimism attitude on depression and coping strategies",
      "abstract": "Depression is a word used by mental health professional to refer an illness or group of illness called mood disorder. Depression may be described as feeling sad, blue, unhappy, miserable, or down in the dumps. Most of us feel this way at one time or another for short periods. It's impossible to escape life's ups and downs. Feeling unhappy or sad in response to disappointment, loss, frustration or a medical condition is normal. Many people use the word to explain these kinds of feelings, but that is really situational depression, which is a normal reaction to events around us. Clinical depression, though, overwhelms and engulfs your day to day life, interfering with your ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and have fun. It is unrelenting, with little if any relief. True clinical depression is a mood disorder in which feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with everyday life for an extended period of it.There is a difference, however, between a normal grief reaction and one that is disabling or unrelenting. While there's no set timetable for grieving, if it doesn't let up over time or extinguishes all signs of joy laughing at a good joke, brightening in response to a hug, appreciating a beautiful sunsetit may be depression. Brown and Haris (1978) reported that depression increases with the age due to several factors of day today life like burden of responsibility, sleeping problems, declining health etc.Coping strategies refer to the specific efforts, both behavioral and psychological, that people employ to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize stressful events.There are many different ways of coping but they all involve making some change in input-output relationships. Thus some methods of coping involve changing, controlling and even avoiding certain inputs, whether the problem is attacked by working on inputs that in internal processes or outputs, it will be one of the two major ways of adjustingdefensive coping or direct coping. Defensive coping involves protecting oneself by getting away from threatening inputs. Direct coping involves meeting challenges head on. Coping with stress may begin with the occurrence of a stressful even, during exposure to stressor and finally after it has taken places. However, successful coping with stress should depend on a number of factors such as individual attitude, perception of life stress and suffering and personal skills, capability of problem solving and decision making. Raju, Rohini, and Naga (2008) revealed that among the old age people 21.3% of them were severely depressed and diabetes is experienced mostly by the elderly whose age is between 70-80 years. The severely depressed older adults were suffering with blood pressure and asthma. The mildly depressed older adult's experiences suicidal tendencies, hearing problems, loneliness, diabetes and problem with the eyes.Sahu, (2007) found gender differences on life stress and significant negative relationship between life stress and coping was observed. It was also extended for males but this relationship was not found significant for females. Folkman, S. and Lazarus, R.S (1980) evaluated age difference in the use of problem focused coping and emotion focused coping among individuals aged 45 to 64. The younger group was found to use emotion focused approach more i.e. they used more of accepting responsibility, distancing more than o lder group.Considering the above facts the present study was undertaken to observe the Optimists and Pessimists on Depression and Coping strategies.Hypotheses of the studyTo achieve the main objective of the study following hypothesis are framed;* Optimists will have significantly low level of Depression as compared to Pessimists and its dimensions.* Optimists and pessimists will differ significantly on the tendency of using Coping Strategies and its dimensions.MethodParticipantsThe total sample was consisted of 255 optimists and 191 pessimists subjects. …",

For the treatment of cases with FSS, first, signs of underlying psychological distress should be identified during history taking. It is essential to address the psychosocial aspect in these cases from a medical point of view. Drug therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors is therefore prescribed. Next, psychotherapy should be introduced. The final strategy usually is to collaborate with a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.",

Although it has been considered as part of impulse control disorders, it has also been reported associated with other disorders.

Multiple psychosocial and health-related factors and prior exposures are associated with risk for clinical depression, anxiety, and negative mood symptoms and syndromes in women of all ages. These include low socioeconomic status, life stressors, inadequate social support, vulnerable personality traits, medical conditions, vasomotor symptoms, psychiatric history, health history, reproductive-related factors, childhood abuse and family history and genetics. Few are specific or unique to psychiatric morbidity during the menopausal transition. Those that may be more prevalent or limiting during this period of life than prior to it include vasomo-tor symptoms, life stressors, and increased physical problems. The extent to which the physical and biological changes during the transition make women more vulnerable to the effects of factors such as low social support, a tendency to ruminate, or a history of childhood abuse are not known.",

      "title": "The role of architectural design for rheumatic patients’ wellbeing: the point of view of Environmental Psychology",
      "abstract": "Rheumatic diseases (RD) are among the most frequent disorders in the population and the major causes of chronic pain and disability. The resulting consequences are catastrophic, leading to a significant socio-economic burden, which includes significant reductions in quality of life (QoL) and limitations in regular work and daily activities of patients. In spite of this, rheumatic diseases are often misunderstood or diagnosed late, probably due to their characteristics of silent diseases, sometimes unrecognizable to unaffected or unskilled people. Actually, it is surprising that, despite their consequences on QoL and on individual impact, rheumatic diseases are underestimated by the public opinion, which is probably more attracted by other major diseases causing death. This silent perception can even be seen in some among the most recent psycho-social approaches to population needs in the fields of Health Psychology and Environmental Psychology. The latter, also known as Architectural Psychology, is a branch of Psychology that analyses the effects of the built environment on humans, including those affected by diseases. Paradoxically, in many cases, some components of the environments created to protect individuals and/or the population may represent barriers and subsequently causes of disability and suffering in patients with rheumatic diseases. In order to increase awareness about this particular aspect of social life, HEMOVE Onlus, a non-profit association, has promoted the creation of a multidisciplinary Task Group, which included mainly rheumatologists, psychologists and architects, with the aim of applying also for the benefit of rheumatic patients the most modern technical skills available in the context of Environmental Psychology, including in particular design and information technology.",

However, social science and social psychology in particular fall short in the analysis of autistic behavior, the real-life manifestations of the disorder. In this address, I suggest that unless we tackle behavior in interaction, rather than as emanating from individuals, we cannot analytically comprehend behavior as a socially real and holistic entity. The particular phenomena under investigation is transpositioning, or how a neurotypical (NT) professional initiates a sequence of action (first position) involving a recipient who has ASD. Then, the person with ASD fashions a response (second position) that is resistive or noncooperative. However, the NT professional subsequently fashions an action that portrays the ASD person’s second position or responsive behavior as an initiation or feature independent of what may have prompted it. Moreover, in reporting on the event in police, clinical, or other records, there is an elision of the prior initiations or first position actions such that the person with ASD is shown to have manifested ostensibly autonomous and anomalous behavior requiring interventions or remediation.",

Punding represents a need to perform senseless activities repeatedly, such as folding and refolding clothes in a drawer for hours at a time, polishing pennies, or pulling weeds from a lawn or threads from a rug. The more common ICDs include gambling disorder, compulsive sexual disorder, consumerism, and hobbyism, but may include strikingly unusual activities that are extraordinarily narrow in their focus.

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "A view of the helplessness and violence contained in chronic fatigue syndrome",
      "abstract": "In this work, originally undertaken 10 years ago, the author asks whether there might be any one particular psychopathology likely to be linked specifically with the physical illness known as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalitis (ME), and whether CFS/ME aids and abets, and ‘fits’, an original mental state. She thinks the question cannot yet be answered, but hypothesizes that in some personality structures the onset of CFS/ME following a physical illness exacerbates negativity, and is an aspect of ordinary depression where there is a lowering of energy levels and a loss of zest for life, or it may reveal the pathological aspect of unresolved rage. Depending on the degree of pathological disturbance, working with and through the rage may or may not result in a resolution of the symptoms of ME. Some of the problems in the transference and countertransference relationship are considered, which make it extremely difficult to separate out reality from fantasy. There is then the further problem of the denial of the psyche by the patient as part of the violence inherent in the illness. The findings in this paper are corroborated by research undertaken over the last four years and these are incorporated into the paper. One case is presented, an example of ME in a borderline male patient in whom resolution could not be achieved. Copyright © 2005 The British Association of Psychotherapists",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

Conservative treatment in the form of rest, heat, analgesics, and guarded activity often reduce the reflex muscle spasm. However, most patients prefer to remain active for one reason or another and hence they seek medical attention for the purpose of shortening the acute phase of the disease. Skeletal-muscle spasm or muscular splinting may be considered to be a persistent, painful, and reversible contracture of striated muscle, usually localized to an area of trauma, inflammatory disease, or other pathological process not amenable to voluntary control. Psychogenic factors such as anxiety, tension, and emotional stress can accentuate as well as be the precipitating cause of acute skeletal-muscle spasm. The \"tension\" headache in which muscle contraction plays a prominent role is a prime example.<sup>1</sup> Since the introduction of mephenesin, an interneuronal",

      "title": "Post traumatic stress disorder in postpartum: when guilt delays recovery. A case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction PTSD is a mental disorder that may develop after exposure to threatening or horrifying events. PTSD is characterized by the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present in the form of vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares. Re-experiencing may occur via one or multiple sensory modalities and is typically accompanied by strong or overwhelming emotions, particularly fear or horror, and strong physical sensations; 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event or events, activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. The symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Some reviewes found that PTSD is prevalent during pregnancy and after birth and may increase during postpartum if not identified and treated. It can affect women, their relationship and birth outcomes aswell as infant emotion regulation and development. The findings indicate that there are links between psychological, traumatic and birth-related risk factors as well as the perceived social support and the possible PTSD following childbirth in mothers and partners. Objectives A case report is presented alongside a review of the relevant literature regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD. Methods We present a case report of a 34-year-old woman with no previous contact with Mental Health Services. She got pregnant unexpectedly in the context of a long stable relationship. At the beginning she was feeling uncertain about carrying on with the pregnancy but finally decided to keep it. She states she felt well throughout the pregnancy. The night after giving birth her baby suffered from a cardiorespiratory arrest, which was noticed by the nursing team but not by the mother. The baby recovered with no medical sequelae but the patient started feeling depressed and presenting anergy, apathy, irritability, flashbacks, and intrusive memories of her sick baby and insomnia, checking every hour during the night that her child was still breathing. Later she developed separation anxiety from her baby, not being able to leave her in the kindergartner nor to leave her alone with other family members (including the father). Guilty feelings were persistantly observed during the therapy sessions. Results Psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment was started with moderate improvement. Since breastfeeding was a rewarding experience and enforced the mother-daughter bond it was taken in consideration for the therapeutic plan. Conclusions The postpartum period is of special vulnerability and early treatment of symptoms in mothers is of great importance. Early diagnosis in maternity services should be a priority.

      "abstract": "The modern concept of stress is based on responses to events or factors (\"stressors\") experienced as aversive, threatening or excessive for maintaining physiological equilibrium of an organism. Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

The doctor requires knowledge, skill, and most of all experience, but can improve the chances of a correct diagnosis and appropriate management by careful history taking, examination, and observation. This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases. The incidence during hospitalisation ranges from 4–30%, again depending on the population studied.

      "abstract": "Health and disease processes are developed due to biological, psychological and social determinants. Obesity is usually associated with mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This association is evidenced in both directions. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety and eating disorders, contribute to the development of obesity, as well as obesity increases the incidence of mental disorders. When stability and homeostasis are disrupted, due to chronic stress and factors such as genetics, environment, affective relationships and psychosocial support, allostatic overload is evidenced. Through this overload, multiple systems are misbalanced and clinical diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, occur. The diagnoses of mental disorders are made based on a combination of somatic and psychiatric symptoms. Unexplained physical complaints and generic symptoms like depressed mood, sadness, impatience, irritability and restlessness are the most frequent ones, together with sleep and appetite disturbances, caused both by physical and mental disorders. These factors often make the correct diagnosis in obese patients more difficult. The primary care professionals must be alert to physical complaints and psychological distress present in organic disorders. The understanding of physiopathological effects of stress and emotional suffering in somatic disorders reinforces that effective care in chronic diseases, such as obesity, has to be organized including these aspects. Treatment needs to be comprehensive so that care can be effective and physical and mental disorders can be properly solved. New therapeutic approaches must be focused on the person, the family and the community instead of focused on the disease. This is essential in the treatment of obesity as it is directly associated with lifestyle, emotional state and stress level, which depends on a change of the individual and his ways of living to be solved. Through this approach, primary care may promote health and prevent diseases.",

Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition.

Equally important is the relationship of physical factors in the genesis of ‘psychological’ disorders. So intimately related are the two categories of causes and of effects that their separation amounts, in principle, to a falsification of the issue—a recourse to dogmatic artificiality. In modern psychological and psychiatric circles the differentiation of psyche and soma has come to be recognized as a gratuitous over-simplification that cannot do justice to the essential facts. A sick man is a sick man whether his illness arises primarily in structural defects or in his life experiences. It is less than scientific to confine attention to either the somatic or the psychological facet of the total individual. The physician is doing less than his full duty to the patient when he fails to give his attention to the real etiology, whatever it may be, and to utilize appropriate therapeutic agencies of any legitimate sort whether drugs, hormones, physical therapy, re-education, or what not.",

      "abstract": "Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a frequent diagnosis for sickness absence. The process of sick-listing is complex, and the doctor must integrate information from several levels in the decision. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe the main determinants of sickness absence for LBP. Methods: We conducted a non-systematic search in Medline and personal files to identify determinants of sickness absence, and structured these into four levels of the sick-listing process. These levels are characteristics of 1) the sick-listed worker, 2) the sick-listing doctor, 3) the workplace, and 4) the cultural and economic conditions of the society. Results: Important characteristics of the sick-listed person seem to be poor mental health, including negative beliefs about LBP. Also, comorbidity and lack of coping abilities are found associated to sickness absence. The impact of the doctors' personal beliefs about LBP is not clear. Doctors in general seem to be frustrated by their gatekeeper role and the influence of other healthcare providers on the sick-listing decision. The workplace is an important factor in the sick-listing process, but the impact of physical working conditions is of less importance than social support, job control, and demands. On the society level, the economic awards in sickness absence and the general acceptance of being sick listed seem to be of importance for the individual's decision to claim sick leave. Conclusion: The sick-listing process for LBP is complex, and the determinants are mostly non-medical. It seems important to adopt a broad perspective of how a worker copes with pain and how these coping strategies interact with cultural, economic, and societal determinants of sickness certification.",

      "title": "Pain Is An Uncomfortable Sensation",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation that indicates that the body is damaged or threatened with injury. Pain starts at special pain receptors that are found all over the body. These pain receptors transmit messages as electrical impulses along nerves to the spinal cord and then upward to the brain. Sometimes the signal when it reaches the spinal cord elicits a reflex response. When this happens, the signal is immediately sent back by the motor nerve to the site of pain, encouraging the muscles to tighten. An example of a reflex reaction is an immediate withdrawal reaction after something very hot is inadvertently touched. The pain signal is also transmitted to the brain. Only when the brain processes the signal and perceives it as pain does the person become aware of it. Pain felt in some areas of the body does not have to indicate exactly where the problem is, because the pain can be transferred to another area. Transmitted pain occurs because signals from several areas of the body often go to the spinal cord and brain through the same nerve pathways. The ability to endure pain varies with mood, personality, and conditions. Pain can change greatly with age. As people get older, they complain less about pain, perhaps because changes in the body reduce the sensation of pain. On the other hand, older people may simply be more stoic than younger people.",

Some plaintiff attorneys argue that it is not the purview of psychologists to diagnose a somatoform disorder, because it requires that true physical disorder and dysfunction be ruled out. Even some psychologists have testified that psychologists can only provide a somatoform diagnosis if a physician has already questioned whether claimed symptoms are excessive in light of objective medical findings. Plaintiff attorneys may allege that an accident and resultant injury has directly caused a somatoform disorder, and that the somatoform symptoms are just as disabling as true brain injury, arguing along the lines. Research has shown that personality test results obtained both before and after concussion in patients with chronic postconcussion symptoms are similar and reveal a somatoform orientation, indicating that the concussion did not \"cause\" the somatoform behavior.",

The term complex psychogenic pain can be used when autonomic changes such as temperature abnormalities and physical findings such as tenderness accompany the pain. It is proposed that complex psychogenic pain is co-encoded centrally during a traumatizing event where the person experiences rage or fear with concomitant pain but is constrained from responding to the circumstances. Complex psychogenic pain is encoded as dissociated from the event. However, subsequent subconscious stimuli that recreate similar emotional, somatosensory, or cognitive states can activate a re-perception of the traumatic pain and engage various vasomotor processes. It is speculated that complex psychogenic pain is generated from amygdala efferents and is encoded in such a manner that precludes simple forgetting. The...",

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

AssessmentThe presence of post-traumatic stress disorder is often missed.When patients present with repeated non-specific health problems the GP should consider asking about exposure to traumatic events.A screening tool can be helpful (Box 1). 5 This brief screen can be supplemented by a more detailed symptom review such as the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist.",

The determination of physiological reactions to chronic stressors may be useful in assessing stressogenic traits of various jobs, understanding morbid effect of stress and recognising persons oversensitive to occupational stress.

Patients with a high degree of medical comorbidity often require inpatient management for evaluation and monitoring of initial treatment. Determining whether a \"depressive\" symptom is best attributed to depression or to an underlying medical condition is particularly challenging. Depression is highly prevalent in patients with neurological illnesses such as cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Psychiatric presentation of depression and psychiatric comorbidity often necessitate inpatient management. Depression with active suicidality, severe anorexia, or presence of psychosis in depressed patients are common indications for hospitalization. Comorbid alcohol or other substance abuse or history of bipolar disorder requires intensive monitoring and treatment. Assessment of suicidality is a frequent reason for psychiatric consultation. An algorithm for suicide assessment is provided. Other clinical factors to consider when deciding whether to hospitalize include presence of agitation and comorbid cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Pain is well known to be a common dominant symptom in people with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs). Perhaps less well acknowledged by healthcare professionals are fatigue and sleep disturbances in these patients. Individually these symptoms are problematic but when combined their effect and impact on patients' lives is greatly amplified; often leaving people in a vicious cycle whereby being in pain results in poor sleep leading to fatigue the next day, which lowers patients' pain tolerance resulting in a poorer night\"s sleep, more fatigue and increased pain. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance greatly reduce quality of life for people with RMDs. Patients have to adapt their daily and leisure activities, or give them up altogether with negative psychological consequences such as anxiety and depression. Patients can end up feeling helpless and sometimes suicidal. Relationships with partners and friends are often altered affecting their sexual and social lives. Major life decisions, such as having a baby, can be put on hold or shelved. People with RMDs may also have to reduce their working hours or stop working, which has financial repercussions for them and their families. This can exacerbate stress, anxiety and depression leading to poorer health outcomes. It is therefore of great importance that healthcare professionals understand the extent to which pain, fatigue and sleep difficulties impact on patients' lives so that priority can be given to addressing these distressing symptoms as part of any management strategy. <h3>Disclosure of Interests:</h3> None declared",

      "abstract": "Participation in (paid) work is an important aspect of life. Work generates an income, leads to social contacts, may stimulate personal development, self esteem and identity. Work is generally good for health and well-being, provided the working conditions are alright. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are a major cause of work disability. It is important for health professionals to realize that patients may not only suffer from pain and impairment but may also become work disabled, which has large consequenses. They should address work-related problems in their contacts with persons with MSD, to analyze the relation between work load and health condition. The work load may cause (or contribute to) symptoms and the course of the disorder. Conversely, the disorder may affect the work capacity, leading to reduced productivity (presenteeism) or sick leave (absenteeism). Modified work tasks, ergonomic improvements or use of supportive devices may decrease the job load; adequate clinical management of the disorder and graded activity interventions may improve the work capacity of the person. There is a lot of evidence on the management of work disability in low back pain; work disability in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis is increasingly getting attention in research and clinical practice. This session will present state of the art knowledge on this issue; participants will be invited to discuss possibilities and barriers for clinicians and researchers in preventing work disability in musculoskeletal disorders. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared",

      "title": "The mediator role of difficulties in emotion regulation in the relationship between guilt and shame-proneness and somatic symptoms",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background Shame is a distressing self-conscious emotion which arises from evaluating oneself as immodest or indecorous and leads to avoidant behaviour as well as defensive anger. Guilt is the negative appraisal of a behaviour or thought and provides readiness to take action to compensate for the wrongdoing. Experiencing these emotions more intensely and frequently with interruptions during the daily life is named as shame or guilt-proneness. Emotion regulation includes processing and regulation of emotions to keep one pursuing goals in life. Individuals who lack effective skills to regulate their emotions or adopt ineffective ones experience difficulties in emotion regulation. Somatic symptoms include medically unexplained symptoms that one suffers from. Mostly, these symptoms, such as headache, dizziness or nausea, are due to unprocessed emotions carried from childhood as a result of maltreatment or abuse. The literature shows that these variables are related to each other. Methods This study focuses on how emotion regulation difficulties mediate between shame and guilt-proneness and somatic symptoms. The data were collected from 374 participants on online platforms using questionnaires with relevant scales. In order to summarize the data collected descriptive statistics was conducted and the relationship between variables was understood with correlation analysis. Furthermore, predictor role of shame-proneness was analysed with regression analysis and mediation analysis was employed to reveal the mediator role difficulties in emotion regulation in relationship between shame-proneness and somatic symptoms. Conclusion The results illustrated that all variables except guilt-proneness were associated with each other and difficulties in emotion regulation have a mediator role between two variables. The results can benefit mental health workers and patients who lack emotion regulation strategies and deal with somatic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Health concerns related to the quality of the environment in offices, schools, homes, and residences have increased dramatically over the past 2 decades. One health problem frequently confronting medical practitioners and often attributed to environmental quality problems is idiopathic environmental intolerances (IEI). Formerly known as multiple chemical sensitivities, IEI is an acquired disorder characterized by adverse reactions attributed to exposure to a variety of substances under ordinary conditions. Alleged precipitants include solvents, pesticides, detergents, dusts, and fragrances. Symptoms include fatigue, malaise, headache, concentration and memory difficulties, lightheadedness, cough, hoarseness, and rhinitis without objective physical signs or consistent laboratory abnormalities. The role of the environment in precipitating these complaints continues to be controversial, and no intervention or treatment has thus far been proven to be effective. While not progressive or life threatening, IEI is often functionally disabling and very distressing to affected individuals. The investigation of IEI should involve, at a minimum, a clinical evaluation of the affected person and in most cases an environmental evaluation as well. IEI should be managed without overutilization of diagnostic tests or prescription of unnecessary environmental, occupational, or dietary restrictions.",

      "abstract": "Causes of aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents are manifold with exogenous and endogenous factors such as personality traits, temperament, family, socio-cultural, economic and financial factors closely intertwined. Aggressive behaviour, however, can also be associated with mental disorders and this is the topic discussed by the present article. Isolated and occasional outbursts of anger, aggressiveness and rage in children and adolescents can often be confused with conduct disorder. However, conduct disorder is characterised by a stable aggressive behavioural pattern, recurrently violating either the basic rights of the others or of the generally accepted social norms. Aggressive behaviour can also be present in Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD), affective and psychotic disorders, autistic spectrum disorders and in some other developmental neurological disorders including intellectual disability ‒ but only as a possible and not a typical symptom. Child and adolescent psychiatrist can mainly help with aggressive behaviour associated with mental disorders. In all other possible causes of aggressive behaviour, child and adolescent psychiatry has neither the possibility/capacity nor the authority to intervene.",

      "abstract": "Besides cognitive changes, dementia disorders have other very important symptoms. Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

Negative symptoms occur alongside positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations in acute psychotic episodes, where they generally respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication, but for the 15-20% of patients for whom negative symptoms are enduring,1 2 current treatment strategies have modest benefits at best.\n\nA critical but often difficult clinical distinction is between primary and secondary negative symptoms,3 The former constitute an enduring deficit state within schizophrenia, whereas the latter can be manifestations of depressive features or medication side effects such as bradykinesia (as part of drug induced parkinsonism), or the consequence of positive symptoms (for example, social and emotional withdrawal may be a response to persecutory delusions or reflect a patient’s avoidance of social stimulation to minimise the provocation of intrusive psychotic experiences). Irrespective of cause, persistent negative symptoms disproportionately limit recovery4 and are associated with poorer occupational and social functioning in the community, including a reduced likelihood of living independently.5 6\n\nFindings from studies that have tested drug strategies for negative symptoms in the context of acute psychotic episodes may not be generalisable to those with persistent symptoms. Few published studies have specifically recruited patients with illness characterised by persistent symptoms.\n\nThe introduction of the second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, was accompanied by claims of better efficacy against negative symptoms, but whether any such effect is independent of an improvement in positive symptoms or medication …",

The symptomatology of the disorder is demarcated as positive and the negative symptoms. The positive symptoms including delusions, illusions, auditory hallucinations, and thought disorders are the additional behaviors that develop after an individual develops the illness whereas the negative symptoms include introverted behavior, poor sociability, emotional blunting, amotivation, and cognitive deficits that reflect a decline in the normal functioning capacity of the person. People with psychotic disorders exhibit a significant reduction in the overall quality of life particularly in the domains of physical and mental health, social intercourses, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. Psychotic disorders are also one of the leading causes of disability and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally, causing a dent in the economy of a country through the inherent direct healthcare costs and the indirect costs (productivity and income losses) causing a depletion in capital and labor resource pool and subsequently causing a decrease in the overall productive capacity of the country. The existing literature highlights the importance of early interventions in psychosis, community-based multidisciplinary approaches including cognitive behavior therapy, somatic interventions, and pharmacotherapy in curtailing the impact and ameliorating the overall quality of life in people with psychosis.",

An amputee faces problems in almost every psychosocial sphere. 1 , 2 Along with physical pain in the stump, patients may experience phantom sensations. 3 – 5 Patients may also grieve, feel depressed, and anxious 3 , 6 , 4 , 7 or have posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. 8 , 9 They may be apprehensive about their future plans and inconclusive regarding life challenges. Grief is one of the most common reactions to amputation, 10 , 1 , 7 but often gets neglected in intensive surgical units. 1 Many times, grief reactions are not resolved, turning into complicated grief or prolonged grief, leading to conditions like depression, anxiety, or even suicide. This article is about an attempt to help a patient initiate the grieving process for healthy outcomes.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Among older persons, the prevalence of a depressive disorder is high. Almost half of the depressed patients suffer from significant anxiety symptoms. In clinical practice this combination of depression and anxiety is challenging as high levels of anxiety in depression are associated with more impairment and a worse prognosis. Anxiety in late-life depression has many faces. It can represent itself in a physical or mental form, like tension or worry. With all its complications it can also be categorized as a separate anxiety disorder, like a panic disorder or a generalized anxiety disorder. Many former studies that examined this so-called ‘anxious depression’ did not differentiate between depression with high levels of anxiety and a depression with a concurrent anxiety disorder.Our general message stresses the importance to differentiate between these depressive states. Different characteristics are found, like certain personality traits or the impact of life-events. These characteristics differentiate even further when we look at separate concurrent anxiety disorders. The combination of anxiety and depression shows a less favorable course and has a negative impact on complete remission over a period of two years. In one of the studies, we investigated the feasibility of a method of intensive repeated measurements. The patient reported about her depressive and anxiety symptoms five times a day during her daily activities. This provided a detailed insight in her symptom dynamics and stimulated a dialogue on possible treatment targets and interventions.",

      "abstract": "In numerous medical domains and across all stages of medical education and practice, there are instances of burnout, depression, contemplation of self-injury, and dissatisfaction with the equilibrium between work and personal life. Burnout is typified by a gradual deterioration in emotional, attitudinal, and physical wellness. Healthcare professionals grappling with burnout may perceive patients as mere objects and undergo a profound emotional void. This is marked by a diminished enthusiasm for work (emotional exhaustion), a feeling of detachment (depersonalization), and a diminished sense of personal gratification. An extensive investigation into emotional burnout across various medical disciplines highlights orthopaedic surgery as one of the fields with the highest incidence of burnout. Evaluating the workload and work atmosphere presents avenues for mitigating stressors associated with burnout. Deliberating on specific psychological elements like emotional intelligence, resilience, and mindfulness could prove efficacious in mitigating burnout. Addressing both physical and mental well-being is imperative in alleviating burnout. The elevated prevalence of burnout among orthopaedic surgeons may necessitate the enforcement of preemptive measures at different levels, encompassing institutional and governmental realms.",

There are, however, some features that may positively orient diagnosis: age at onset and sex, clinical history, presence of a subdepressive state, attitude during the medical examination, absence of delusions and hallucinations, and the Rorschach test pattern.

      "title": "Enigma Of The Orefrontal Lobe",
      "abstract": "There are approximately three signature behavioral/cognitive syndromes that occur after damage to prefrontal cortex and its circuitary. First, damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit causes executive dysfunction. These patients have difficulty in generating hypotheses and flexibility in maintaining and shifting sets as required by changing task demands. Second, damage to the orbitofrontal circuit causes disinhibited, irritable and labile behavior. This type of lesion also results in imitation and utilization behavior. Unlike patients with dorsolateral damage, these patients may not have executive impairments. Thirdly, damage to the medial frontal/anterior cingulate circuit causes akinesia, apathy and unconcern. Of course, patients may have damage to more than one of these frontal circuits, leading to a combination of clinical deficits. Unfortunately, these deficits may be hard to quantify on standard neuropsychological tests and may only be evident in real-life situations. This paucity of objective findings may lead to overlooking the possibility of damage to the frontal lobes in some patients. The frontal lobes may be less hard-wired than other cortical areas. They may act as an orchestrator for integrating other cortical areas and for calling up behavior programs that are appropriate for the context. Although this article is intended to outline a number of apparent frontal lobe functions, it is obvious that the functions of this massive and phylogenetically novel prefrontal cortex are complex, interrelated and as yet incompletely understood.",

Clinical reports suggest that many adults who engage in self-destructive behavior have childhood histories of trauma and disrupted parental care. Painless cutting after a period of depersonalization, followed by relaxation and repersonalization after bleeding, is the typical pattern reported. Complications include social rejection and condemnation as a response both to the behavior or the resulting disfigurement. The most serious complication of self-mutilation is death as a direct result of damage inflicted on the body or from a drug overdose. Primary care providers are in an excellent position to identify and intervene in self-injurious behavior. Establishing a trusting relationship appears to be the most critical component of assessing and treating the client who self-mutilates. Psychotherapy and psychotropic medications, though not specific to self-mutilation, remain the most compelling treatment options.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure.

Clinical data reveal that it is not conclusive to extrapolate findings related to grief to a particular drowning event. Grief is emotional, is often an unknown reaction, and it does not always make sense. As an individual experiences grief, dwelling on what has been lost is part of the normal process. The individual is faced with their loss on a daily basis and for some, moving through this process may be very difficult. This is an assessment conducted by a neuropsychologist or a trained skill psychometrist.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :\r\nNeck pain (or cervicalgia) is a common problem, with sixty percent of the\r\npopulation suffering with it at some point in their lives. Neck pain, although felt in the\r\nneck, can be caused by many other spinal problems. Neck pain may arise due to\r\nmuscular tightness in both the neck and upper back, and pinching of the nerves\r\nemanating from the cervical spine. Non-Specific Neck Pain is the most common one.\r\nThis is also known as 'simple' or “Mechanical' neck pain. The causes may be minor\r\nstrains and sprains to muscles or ligaments in the neck. Bad posture seems to be the\r\nmajor contributing factor in many cases. Neck pain can be caused due to many other\r\nphysical and emotional health problems as well.\r\nNeck pain is more common in people who spend most of their day working at\r\na desk, in front of the computer with a 'bent-forward' posture or ‘forward head\r\ncarriage’ posture. Non-Specific Neck Pain is most often caused by continuous\r\nforward head carrying posture leading to sub-occipital muscle tightness, decreased\r\ncervical mobility and obliterated cervical spine curvature. Forward head posture is\r\ncommonly adopted by visual display terminal [VDT] workers involving a\r\ncombination of lower cervical flexion and upper cervical extension. The important\r\ncauses of forward head posture are improperly placed computer screen, looking down\r\nwhile typing or reading, sitting improperly with shoulders rounded and back hunched,\r\nslouched postures or end result of faulty pelvic and lumbar spine posture.\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY :\r\nTo determine the efficacy of physiotherapeutic techniques in the treatment of\r\nNon-Specific Neck Pain due to Sub-occipital muscle tightness among\r\ncomputer professionals.\r\nTo systematically compare the efficacy of Active Chin Tucking Exercises and\r\nsub occipital muscle release in the treatment of Non-Specific Neck Pain due to\r\nSub-occipital muscle tightness among computer professionals.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\n It is concluded that there is reduction of pain among computer professionals\r\ntreated with Ultrasound Therapy and Active Chin Tucking Exercise for their\r\nneck pain. It is concluded that there is improvement in Neck function among computer\r\nprofessionals with neck pain treated with Ultrasound Therapy and Active Chin\r\nTucking Exercise. It is concluded that there is reduction of pain among computer professionals\r\ntreated with Ultrasound Therapy and Sub Occipital Muscle Release Technique\r\nfor their neck pain. It is concluded that there is improvement also in Neck function among\r\ncomputer professionals with neck pain treated with Ultrasound Therapy and\r\nSub Occipital Muscle Release Technique. It is concluded that combination of Ultrasound Therapy with Active Chin Tucking Exercise training group showed statistically significant improvement\r\nin neck function than the other group. It is concluded that Ultrasound Therapy with Sub Occipital Muscle Release Technique training group showed statistically significant reduction in pain\r\nthan the other group.",

Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

Factors affecting employee health and well-beingcan have a significant impact on the financial costs associatedwith employee health and the profitability of the business.Action needs to be taken at an individual and organisationallevel to reduce the levels of stress and burnout syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Although recognized as early as 1924 by Bleuler, depression and, more generally, mood disorders following cerebral lesions have only been studied systematically in the last 20 years. Initial studies of emotional disorders in brain injuries included patients with various lesions such as surgical incision, traumatic closed head injuries, penetrating head injury and stroke making it difficult to determine the location of the lesion. Some more recent stroke studies suggest a critical role of the anterior left hemisphere in depression, but other authors deny causal contribution of lesion location to depression. The predominant role of the right hemisphere in secondary mania is well recognized, but a consensus is still lacking and further studies are needed to determine the clinico-topographic correlation of disorders, such as apathy, anxiety, catastrophe reaction and pathological laughing and crying sometimes encountered after stroke. These affective disorders are important to consider in stroke patients, since they may negatively influence neurological recovery and may be responsive to treatment.",

Patients with the consequences of self-injuries receive help from physicians of various specialties, who often cannot determine their motivation for autoaggressive actions, since it is associated with mental disorders. The paper presents data on phenomenology, some classifications and motivation of nonsuicidal self-injuries. Various mental disorders are noted to be the most common cause of autoaggressive behavior. The paper describes a clinical case of a female patient who has mutilated her face for a long time, hiding the cause of her autoaggressive action. A detailed clinical and psychopathological analysis of her medical history and mental status allowed for classifying hypochondriacal delirium within schizophrenia as a cause of self-mutilating actions. The motivation for this behavior was to fight against a pseudotumor, for which the patient suffered pain and prolonged suppurative processes on the skin of the face, without visiting physicians.",

This is consistent with the proposal that sensory dysfunction could provoke distress and a discrepancy between the multi-sensory frame given by experience and the actual perception. Both vestibular stimuli and vestibular dysfunction can underlie unreal experiences. Vestibular afferents provide a frame of reference (linear and angular head acceleration) within which spatial information from other senses is interpreted. This paper reviews evidence that symptoms of depersonalization/derealization associated with vestibular dysfunction are a consequence of a sensory mismatch between disordered vestibular input and other sensory signals of orientation.",

Definitive clinical testing and/or biological tests rarely exist for most mental illnesses. Even when tests (such as PET scans or excess Abeta42 in cerebral spinal fluid indicating presence of neuronal plaques, for example) and other suggestive biomarkers are \"positive\", there are often no outward cognitive-behavioural symptoms or symptomatic evidence associated with the alleged mental illness (and vice-versa). Furthermore, environmental stressors, dehydration and other fully curable illness and treatable issues such as urinary tract infections, delirium, drug interactions and insomnia can quickly create outward ‘false’ symptoms of mental illnesses, often mistaken for true mental health diagnoses. Therefore, a comprehensive consideration of ex parte narratives, experience, familiarity and also possible underlying motivations, of even the most well-meaning family members in the “family history method” of mental illness diagnoses, currently used by doctors and other professionals, should be revisited.",

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug.

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "A case is presented of a 37-year-old black woman with a 5-year history of a chronic psychotic illness, diagnosed as schizophrenia, who presented to the emergency room complaining of a severe headache, while appearing confused and experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate the way in which the appellation of schizophrenia can be misapplied in a patient with a complicated medical history and poor follow-up evaluation and treatment.Patients with active psychosis are frequently unable to provide a coherent or comprehensive medical history. In the absence of obvious indications to the contrary, a diagnosis of a primary psychiatric illness is often assumed, especially if this label has been applied in the past. However, the differential diagnosis of psychosis is extensive.This patient was given a complete psychiatric and neurologic evaluation, and aspects of the history that had been lost or ignored were uncovered and reevaluated.A diagnosis other than schizophrenia was made and another treatment, other than antipsychotic drugs, was initiated. The patient responded rapidly with improved cognitive function and resolution of her psychotic symptoms.This case serves to illustrate how the absence of a careful clinical assessment and historical case review, in patients who have been previously labeled as schizophrenic, can perpetuate misdiagnoses and inappropriate treatments. It highlights the importance, especially in patients with an incomplete medical history, of ruling out all organic causes of psychosis to avoid inappropriately labeling someone as having a psychiatric illness.",

Esta patologia, aceptada en Espana por la INSS como accidente laboral y posible baja medica, afecta principalmente a aquellas profesiones obligadas a un contacto directo y constante con personas. Por esta razon el personal sanitario es considerado de gran vulnerabilidad, constituyendo los odontologos uno de los grupos de mayor riesgo.

      "title": "Chronicity in Schizophrenia: Fact, Partial Fact, or Artifact?",
      "abstract": "Clinical experience has appeared to support the view that persons with repeated episodes of schizophrenia can expect to have a chronic course with residual symptoms and lasting deficits in such areas as work, social relations, and self-care. However, the authors' review of recent long-term follow-up studies and of the clinical experiences of early researchers strongly challenges this pervasive expectation. This report suggests that there is considerable heterogeneity in the long-term outcome of schizophrenia, with marginal or deteriorated states more the exception than the rule. Among the contributors to the misperception of chronicity are biased sampling, both past and present, as well as a multitude of environmental and psychosocial factors that affect patient outcome.",

      "title": "Editorial: Psychological sleep studies: new insights to support and integrate clinical practice within the healthcare system, volume II",
      "abstract": "Sleep health is essential for overall physical and mental well-being. Insufficient sleep, whether in terms of quantity or quality, significantly impacts an individual's quality of life and day-to-day functioning [1]. Consequences of sleep disorders like insomnia include impaired daytime cognition, reduced work productivity, an increased risk of accidents and injuries, and have been linked to psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and other chronic health conditions. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].Sleep problems may compromise with the treatments that are currently being administered for a wide range of illnesses. When these disorders are addressed, they have the potential to enhance the patient's quality of life and adherence to therapy, as well as the intensity of the psychological symptoms that they are experiencing. It has been shown that there is a complicated association between sleep and mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress disorders. This interaction is considered to be bidirectional [2], [16], [17]. There is a growing demand in the clinical setting for psychologists who are skilled in evidence-based psychotherapy to become members of multidisciplinary health teams. These psychologists would be tasked with providing cognitive-behavioral intervention and support for patients suffering from insomnia [18], narcolepsy [19], [20], and adherence to treatment for obstructive sleep apnea [21].This volume brings together a collection of research that delves into different aspects of sleep health and its relationship with psychological well-being, offering new approaches to addressing these challenges in various populations. The findings provide critical implications for clinical practice, aiming to improve sleep health management across diverse healthcare settings.Luo et al. [22] investigate the mental health challenges, particularly anxiety and poor sleep, experienced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study shows that Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) significantly alleviates anxiety and improves sleep quality among practitioners in high-stress environments like mobile cabin hospitals. The intervention demonstrated a reduction in both anxiety and poor sleep indices, offering an accessible and effective solution to mitigate mental health strains during pandemicrelated crises.This study highlights the potential of PMR as a non-invasive, cost-effective intervention that could be readily implemented in healthcare systems to support the mental health of frontline workers. Given the global scale of the healthcare crisis, integrating such tools into standard healthcare practice could enhance workforce wellbeing and performance.In their study, O'Regan et al. [23] explore the patient journey in managing insomnia across Europe and Canada. By mapping the phases of insomnia management, from self-initiated behavioral changes to long-term reliance on prescription medications, the authors reveal a considerable gap in the alignment of healthcare provider strategies and patient needs. Their research uncovers key points where interventions can be improved, particularly in addressing patient expectations and enhancing education around sleep hygiene and nonpharmacological treatments.Overall, the findings show that patient education is crucial to remove the stigma surrounding insomnia, helping patients recognize that chronic insomnia is a primary disorder that requires appropriate medical management, and encouraging them to seek help earlier. Additionally, healthcare provider education and training on sleep disorders are essential to increase the perception of chronic insomnia as a serious primary medical condition and to fully understand its significant impact on patients' daily lives. Furthermore, the current situation, in which many patients must settle for \"manageable\" insomnia, highlights a serious unmet need regarding the management and treatment of this condition. More comprehensive approaches are needed to ensure that patients receive effective care that goes beyond symptom management, addressing the root causes of their insomnia and improving their long-term health outcomes.Wale et al. [24] shed light on the high prevalence of insomnia among university students in Ethiopia. Their study identifies key predictors, including gender, age, mild anxiety symptoms, and excessive use of mobile devices before bedtime, which significantly contribute to poor sleep quality among students. The findings underscore the impact of lifestyle factors and mental health challenges on sleep patterns in young adults, a group particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances due to academic stress and lifestyle transitions.The study calls for targeted interventions focusing on mental health support and promoting better sleep hygiene among university students. Educational institutions should integrate sleep health education into their wellness programs, emphasizing the importance of mental health and limiting late-night screen exposure.Zambelli et al. evaluate the feasibility of delivering CBT-I through telehealth to chronic pain patients suffering from insomnia [25]. The study shows that adapted CBT-I delivered via telehealth not only improved sleep quality but also alleviated symptoms of anxiety, and depression. The research highlights the growing role of telehealth in making effective sleep interventions more accessible, particularly for populations with mobility issues or those living in remote areas.Telehealth-based interventions offer a scalable and practical solution to reach populations with limited access to in-person therapy. As healthcare systems continue to embrace digital health solutions, telehealth-based CBT-I can play a pivotal role in addressing sleep disorders, particularly in the post-pandemic era where telehealth has become more prominent.While the studies presented in this volume offer important insights, several areas remain unexplored, signaling opportunities for future research. First, the long-term effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions like PMR and CBT-I across diverse populations, including adolescents and the elderly, needs further investigation. Additionally, the impact of behavioral and lifestyle factors, such as mobile device use before bedtime, which has been shown to significantly influence sleep quality, particularly among younger populations, requires deeper examination.As telehealth becomes an increasingly central component of healthcare delivery, there is also a need to assess its broader efficacy across varying cultural contexts, socioeconomic groups, and medical conditions.Understanding how digital interventions like telehealth-delivered CBT-I can be optimized to meet the needs of different populations will be crucial for the equitable expansion of these services.The collection of research in this volume underscores the profound interconnectedness of sleep health and psychological well-being. From frontline healthcare workers grappling with anxiety during pandemics to chronic pain patients benefiting from telehealth-delivered CBT-I, these studies highlight the necessity of integrating sleep health into broader mental healthcare strategies. Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, despite their substantial repercussions on both individual and societal health.Psychologists play a crucial role in addressing sleep-related disorders, not only through therapeutic interventions such as CBT-I but also by promoting sleep hygiene and mental wellness as foundational elements of health. Academic training programs in psychology should emphasize the importance of sleep as a pillar of mental well-being, equipping future practitioners with the skills to recognize, address, and treat sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive mental health approach.To advance a holistic approach, healthcare systems must prioritize early detection and treatment of sleep disorders, leveraging cross-disciplinary methods that integrate mental health, technology, and lifestyle interventions. This volume provides a robust foundation for understanding the significance of sleep in clinical practice, yet ongoing research and innovation will be essential to refine and expand these approaches, fostering a truly integrative model of mental healthcare that includes sleep as a central component.",

      "abstract": "In old age, depression mainly affects those with chronic medical illness, severe disability or mental decline. Depression in elderly worsens the outcomes of many medical illness and increases mortality. Age-related processes, including arteriosclerosis, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, may compromise the integrity of prefrontostriatal pathways and amygdala leading to increased vulnerability to depression. Environmental factors, such as impoverishment, isolation, relocation, caregiving and bereavement, contribute to further increase susceptibility to depression or triggering depression in already vulnerable elderly people. Suitable treatment of depression in elderly reduces the symptoms, prevents suicidal ideation, improves cognitive and functional status and helps patients to develop the skills needed to cope with their disability or psychosocial adversity. Prevention of depression in given pathological conditions may greatly improve the outcomes, mostly the recovery of function and quality of life, as well as the mortality risk. Therefore, it should be considered the opportunity of a depression prophylaxis, particularly in those circumstances in which the risk of depression is noteworthy increased, such as stroke, cancer, institutionalization, etc.",

      "abstract": "Aim The aim of the paper was to present the basic data about delusions of sex change and body dysmorphic disorder and describe two cases of patients with these symptoms and paranoid schizophrenia. Method Analysis of the course of illness and medical documentation. Results Coexisting of transsexualism and schizophrenia cause a lot of doubt. Moreover, delusions of sex change are probably more frequent than it is thought. It causes that in some cases the differential diagnosis of psychosis and gender identity disorders may be very difficult. Treatment of transsexuals is on one hand connected with expected effects but on the other hand with many serious, often irreversible health consequences. That is why the differential diagnosis of transsexualism and schizophrenia should be made carefully and thoughtfully. Body dysmorphic disorder can appear as nonpsychotic or psychotic disorder. The delusional variant can cause diagnostic and therapeutical problems as well as diagnostic mistakes. Sometimes people suffering from this disorder can be diagnosed as having schizophrenia. It usually takes place when psychotic symptoms, obsessions and compulsive activities connected with hiding of the imaginary look problem significantly distort everyday functioning. Conclusions Rare, atypical psychopathological symptoms can coexist with schizophrenia. In this situation it is necessary to act carefully and precisely to make a proper diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Stress at the present time is both subtle and prolonged, affecting the psyche rather than the soma. Adverse effects may ensue in a number of physical illnesses and major depressive illness may supervene. Stress and depression consistently impair the immune response to illness as in cardiac disorders, infections and cancer. The etiology of stress-induced illness is multi-faceted but six important components and six relevant symptoms can be derived from the alphabetical constitution of word itself. In the acute stress situation these changes rapidly revert to normal with cessation of challenge, but with long continued stress, they may become perpetuated and result in adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. An increasing awareness of the role that stress may play in the etiology of sustained hypertension might well lead to a better control of stress factors in the patient's life. Thus, he or she may be spared the \"life sentence\" of antihypertensive drug therapy, which itself may constitute a potent stress factor.",

A few days after shock treatment was terminated, a psychotic reaction appeared, differing in its gross clinical manifestations from the clinical picture which was present when shock treatment was started. It differs from the state of confusion that one usually meets in the course of shock treatment. Such late post-treatment psychotic episodes last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks and then subside. With its evanescence the original clinical complaints of the patient usually subsided. It was felt that the picture could not be entirely explained alone by organic brain damage and to a large extent was dependent upon the personality structure of the patient. The technical suggestion is made that when such a reaction develops, treatment should not be immediately reinstituted. One should wait, a few weeks if necessary, in view of the fact that in all our patients the psychotic episode subsided.",

Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Persistent pain originating from a dysfunctional lumbar motion segment poses significant challenges in the clinical arena. Although the predominance of the existing spine literature has addressed nerve root compression as the principal cause of pain, it is equally likely that a stretch mechanism may be responsible for all or part of the pathology. METHODS The literature supporting the role of stretch damage as a primary cause of nerve root injury and pain was systematically reviewed. Pathoanatomic considerations between nerve roots and juxtaposed environment are described and correlated with the available literature. Potential anatomic relationships that may lead to stretch-induced injury are delineated. RESULTS A dynamic lumbar functional spinal unit that encloses a tethered nerve root can create significant stretch and/or compression. This phenomenon may be present in a variety of pathological conditions. These include anterior, posterior, and rotatory olisthesis as well as degenerative conditions such as the loss of disc interspace height and frank multisegment spinal deformity. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that stretch can result in nerve damage, the pathophysiology that may associate nerve stretch with chronic pain has yet to be determined. CONCLUSION The current literature concerning stretch-related injury to nerve roots is reviewed, and a conceptual framework for its diagnosis and treatment is proposed and graphically illustrated using cadaveric specimens. The dynamic biomechanical and functional interrelationships between neural structures and adjacent connective tissue elements are particularly important in the face of spinal deformity.",

      "title": "ECT: An Effective Treatment in the Screaming Demented Patient",
      "abstract": "To the Editor:—As a tertiary inpatient geriatric psychiatry program, we are often exposed to a common treatment dilemma, the screaming demented patient. Very little has been published in this area. The studies reporting on agitation are mostly medical descriptions and pharmacologic trials, with verbal agitation being included under the broader symptom cluster of physical or behavioral agitation.1,2 Agitation is usually poorly defined, and in no studies was verbal agitation considered as a separate variable. As a whole, the medication trials achieved only limited degrees of success. Experience dictates that these successes are often more than offset by medication side-effects and drug toxicity, thus further complicating the patient's presentation and course.3 Partly owing to this lack of effective treatment, Fogel4 suggested the need for further investigation of ECT in the screaming demented patient. Verbal agitation (needless, unstimulated screaming, yelling, moaning) occurs in many psychiatric conditions common to the elderly—delirium, dementia and depression. It is unclear whether this is the result of a common final neurochemical pathway or of differing etiologies in the different conditions.5 We wish to report on a small series of three elderly, verbally agitated patients who showed a dramatic improvement in this symptom with bilateral ECT. In none of these patients was ECT the initial treatment modality employed; neuroleptics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines were tried unsuccsssfully first. One patient clearly met the criteria for major depression and had a past history of ECT-responsive mood disorder. In the other two patients, there was no clear history of major depression either past or current; both had a substantial degree of cognitive impairment. All three patients, exhibited rapid resolution of their screaming behaviour early in their course of ECT. These pilot results suggest some interesting directions. Assuming response to ECT, this might support the hypothesis that screaming in dementia may be a presentation of depression where the other symptoms may be difficult to elicit. On the other hand, the response may suggest a specific response to electrotherapy. Irrespective of the mechanism, ECT appears to provide the possibility of effective therapy in the demented patient who screams and could provide an alternative to the more traditional approach of endless trials of progressively more toxic psychotropic drugs, singly and in combination, with poor outcome and potentially devastating toxicity.",

Though multiple knotting of the strangling device, caught hair and parts of clothes and concomitant injuries may also be seen in cases of suicide, they primarily justify the suspicion that the death was caused by another person. If it is one of those rare cases of self-strangulation with multiple knotting, the presence of symptoms of congestion in the head area, which may occasionally be absent in other cases of strangulation, is necessary for pathophysiological reasons.",

Zdravstveni rizici se manifestiraju stetnim i neugodnim djelovanjem na vid, opterecenost misicno-kostanog sustava, psihickim smetnjama vezanim uz stres i umor. Među najcescim smetnjama kod rada na racunalima jesu smetnje vida. Istraživanja su pokazala da se smetnje manifestiraju u obliku naprezanja i umora ociju, ocni kapci se tesko otvaraju i zatvaraju, iritacija, suhoca i pecenje konjunktiva, subjektivni osjecaj “pijeska” u ocima, bol ociju, praceni glavoboljom, mucninom (astenopija), te raznim psihickim i psiholoskim reakcijama. Napor ociju vezan je i uz razne subjektivne faktore kao sto su opci umor, upotreba lijekova, bolest, sklonost migreni, osjetljivost na svjetlo te nervoza i nemir. Svi ti faktori mogu pojacati simptome vidnog napora, no glavni uzroci vidnog napora su bljestanje, kontrastno bljestanje, titranje i svjetlucanje slike na ekranu, reflektiranja te okolnih radnih uvjeta. Prema provedenim ispitivanjima (Kalifornijsko sveuciliste, L.A.) 50% osoba koje rade na racunalu najmanje 4 sata na dan ima problema s ocima. Dokazano je da žene pate od vidnog napora dvostruko vise od muskaraca. Kod rada na kompjutorima oni koji vec imaju smetnje vida imaju vecu vjerojatnost razvoja vidnih napora. Osobe s kataraktom, nistagmusom, glaukomom ne bi se trebale profesionalno baviti radom na racunalima. Tegobe se smanjuju da cesce i nakratko prekidamo gledanje u ekran. Korisno je krace vrijeme brzo treptati, te zatim nekoliko sekundi držati zatvorene oci. Gledati udaljene predmete tridesetak sekundi. Oci prekriti dlanovima oko jedne minute. Visesatnim radom na racunalom treptaji vjeđa postaju sve rjeđi, pa se događa da oci ostaju suhe jer ih vlaži sve manje suza. Umjetne suze kupljene u ljekarni mogu ucinkovito rijesiti ovaj problem.",

      "abstract": "Defined in its strict pharmacologic sense, side effect is any effect of a drug, desirable or undesirable, other than the one sought for a particular therapeutic purpose. Thus, the therapeutic effect of a drug for one case can be the side effect of another. This presentation deals with extraordinary side effects: side effects due to drug interaction, nutrition, age, enzyme abnormality, ecologic disturbance, drug resistance, social problems, and inferior therapy. The best way to limit the side effect of drugs is by basic understanding of drug action obtainable only by well‐controlled, well‐designed experiments in man. Otherwise, drugs will be used without this vital information until, in clinical use by trial‐and‐error method, sufficient data are haphazardly collected to provide conclusive evidence of drug effects. This is the common medical experiment in man, a mass experiment of a retrospective type in which the patient plays the role of the unwitting subject and the phYSician is the unwitting observer. It is inefficient, exposes more patients to poorly understood drugs than necessary, and, until the necessary information is obtained, is marked by avoidable catastrophe.",

      "title": "Research progress on pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome and treatment of traditional Chinese and Western medicine",
      "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a complex and perplexing medical disorder primarily characterized by persistent and debilitating fatigue, often accompanied by a constellation of symptoms, including weakness, dyspnea, arthromyalgia, sore throat, and disrupted sleep patterns. CFS is defined by its persistent or recurrent manifestation for a minimum duration of six months, marked by an enduring and unrelenting fatigue that remains refractory to rest. In recent decades, this condition has garnered significant attention within the medical community. While the precise etiology of CFS remains elusive, it is postulated to be multifactorial. CFS is potentially associated with various contributory factors such as infections, chronic stress, genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, and psychosocial influences. The pathophysiological underpinnings of CFS encompass viral infections, immune system dysregulation, neuroendocrine aberrations, heightened oxidative stress, and perturbations in gut microbiota. Presently, clinical management predominantly relies on pharmaceutical interventions or singular therapeutic modalities, offering alleviation of specific symptoms but exhibiting inherent limitations. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) interventions have emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating notable efficacy through their multimodal, multi-target, multi-pathway approach, and holistic regulatory mechanisms. These interventions effectively address the lacunae in contemporary medical interventions. This comprehensive review synthesizes recent advancements in the understanding of the etiological factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, and interventional strategies for CFS, drawing from a corpus of domestic and international literature. Its aim is to furnish valuable insights for clinicians actively involved in diagnosing and treating CFS, as well as for pharmaceutical researchers delving into innovative drug development pathways. Moreover, it seeks to address the intricate challenges confronted by clinical practitioners in managing this incapacitating condition.",
